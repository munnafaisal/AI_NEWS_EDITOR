"EU adds 28 Belarus officials, ‘propagandists’ to blacklist","The European Union on Monday added 28 officials and ‘propagandists’ in Belarus to a sanctions blacklist over the repression of opponents of leader Alexander Lukashenko. The 27-nation bloc has imposed repeated rounds of sanctions on the Belarusian government since the authorities launched a crackdown on protests against Lukashenko’s rule in 2020. The EU has also ramped up sanctions on Belarus over its role as a key springboard for Russia’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. The latest measures take the number of individuals sanctioned over the clampdown in the former Soviet country to 261, with the list already including Lukashenko and his family members. Among those subjected Thursday to an EU asset freeze and visa ban were Irina Akulovich, head of national news agency BelTA, and prominent television presenter Nikita Rachilovsky. ‘These regime propagandists willingly provided the Belarusian public with false information about repression perpetrated by the state authorities,’ the EU said in a statement. Among others added to the blacklist were two commanders in an interior ministry unit accused of being ‘one of the main bodies responsible for political persecution’. Sanctions were in addition imposed on judges, prosecutors and prison officials involved in the repression of the opposition. Lukashenko, Russia’s closest international ally, launched the vicious crackdown in August 2020 after his claim to have won disputed elections sparked major protests. Leading rights group Viasna estimates Belarus has more than 1,400 political prisoners, with thousands more people having fled the country. Strongman Lukashenko has controlled his country with an iron fist during his three-decade rule.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/241767/eu-adds-28-belarus-officials-propagandists-to-blacklist
US military completes withdrawal from final base in Niger,"The US military has withdrawn its forces from its final base in Niger, the Pentagon said Monday, more than a year after military coup leaders in the African country told them to leave. The ‘withdrawal of US forces and assets from Air Base 201 in Agadez is complete,’ the Pentagon said in a joint statement with Niger’s defense ministry. ‘This effort... will continue between US and Nigerien armed forces over the coming weeks to ensure the full withdrawal is complete as planned,’ it continued. It did not give any detail on what assets the US may still have left to withdraw in the country. Some 200 soldiers had been at the Agadez drone base, in the north of the country. US troops were part of an international effort to suppress jihadist forces that regularly strike across the region. But the Niger military leaders who seized power in a coup a year ago in March told US and French forces to quit the country. ‘Over the past decade, US troops have trained Niger’s forces and supported partner-led counterterrorism missions against Islamic State and al Qaeda in the region,’ the statement continued. ‘The effective cooperation and communication between the US and Nigerien armed forces ensured that this turnover was finished ahead of schedule and without complications,’ it said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/241766/us-military-completes-withdrawal-from-final-base-in-niger
Lebanon says two dead in Israeli strike,"Lebanon’s health ministry said two people were killed on Monday in an Israeli strike on the country’s south, with Hezbollah announcing one of its fighters died and local rescuers mourning a paramedic. Since last week, tensions have soared as Iran and Tehran-backed groups, including Hezbollah, vowed revenge for the killing of Hamas’s political leader in Tehran and Israel’s killing of Hezbollah’s military chief in Beirut. Hezbollah has traded near-daily fire with Israel in support of ally Hamas since the Palestinian militant group’s October 7 attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war. ‘The enemy raid that took place near the (Mais al-Jabal) town’s cemetery killed two people,’ Lebanon’s health ministry said in a statement following Monday’s strike. The state-run National News Agency (NNA) said that one of the two people killed was a paramedic with the Risala Scouts, which is affiliated with Hezbollah ally the Amal movement. Ali Abbas, a rescue worker with the Risala Scouts, told AFP that the paramedic had travelled by motorcycle with another person to inspect the site of an earlier raid. He went ‘to see if there were civilians or people (in the area)... and the second strike happened immediately,’ Abbas said. Hezbollah later announced that a fighter from the same village had been killed by Israeli fire. Amid rising tensions, Israeli jets broke the sound barrier twice over Beirut around noon, according to the NNA, sparking worry in the Lebanese capital. Mais al-Jabal, a frontline village less than two kilometres (1.2 miles) from the border with Israel, has experienced heavy bombardment since the cross-border clashes began, forcing most residents to leave. Early on Monday, Hezbollah said it had targeted military sites in northern Israel with ‘explosive-laden drones’ in response to Israeli ‘attacks and assassinations’ in southern Lebanon. The Israeli military said ‘numerous suspicious aerial targets were identified crossing from Lebanon’ into northern Israel, starting a fire and leaving an officer and a soldier ‘moderately injured’. The cross-border violence since October has killed at least 549 people in Lebanon, mostly fighters but also including at least 116 civilians, according to an AFP tally. On the Israeli side, including the annexed Golan Heights, 22 soldiers and 25 civilians have been killed, according to army figures.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/241765/lebanon-says-two-dead-in-israeli-strike
UN calls for urgent de-escalation in Middle East,"The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk on Monday called for an urgent de-escalation in the Middle East over fears that the Gaza war could spread. ‘I am deeply worried about the rising risk of a wider conflict in the Middle East and plead with all parties, along with those states with influence, to act urgently to de-escalate what has become a very precarious situation,’ said Turk in a statement. Iran on Monday said it had the ‘legal right to punish’ Israel over last week’s killing of Palestinian armed group Hamas’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel, which has not commented on the killing but did admit to carrying out a strike on Beirut that left Hezbollah military chief Fuad Shukr dead, has been fighting a war in Gaza since the October 7 attacks by Hamas. It is now exchanging daily cross-border fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon. The international community fears Iran, a backer of Hezbollah and Hamas, could join the conflict. ‘Already, over the past 10 months, civilians—mostly women and children—have endured unbearable pain and suffering as result of the bombs and guns,’ said Turk. ‘Everything, and I mean everything, must be done to avoid this situation spiralling further into an abyss that will only have even more terrible consequences for civilians.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/241764/un-calls-for-urgent-de-escalation-in-middle-east
Malaysia summons Meta over removed PM posts about Hamas leader,"The Malaysian government said Monday it had met with Meta representatives to demand an apology and explanation as to why posts about the death of a Hamas leader were removed from the prime minister’s social media accounts. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s office said his posts on Facebook and Instagram about Ismail Haniyeh’s death had been removed last week by parent company Meta. The political leader of Palestinian armed group Hamas was killed in Tehran on Wednesday, in an attack blamed on Israel, which has not directly commented on it. Anwar’s posts included a video showing the premier on a phone call with a Hamas official, offering his condolences. On Instagram, there was a note by Meta, shared by Anwar, that the posts were taken down because of association with ‘dangerous individuals and organizations.’ Israel, the United States and the European Union consider Hamas a terrorist organisation. In a statement on Monday, the Malaysian Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said it ‘views Meta’s actions as discriminatory, unjust, and a blatant suppression of free expression.’ ‘It is also seen as an affront to the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people in their pursuit of justice and human rights.’ The PMO said it was demanding a public apology and a detailed explanation from Meta. Anwar accused the tech giant of ‘cowardice’ last week for removing his posts. Malaysian authorities have previously chided Meta for removing posts as well as for not taking down what officials deemed as harmful content fast enough. Meta did not immediately respond to AFP requests for comment on Monday. Last year, Human Rights Watch said ‘Meta’s policies and practices were silencing voices in support of Palestine and Palestinian human rights on Instagram and Facebook.’ Anwar, who met Haniyeh in Qatar in May, has defended Malaysia’s ties with the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group, which launched a deadly attack against Israel on October 7 that triggered the war in Gaza. Anwar stressed during a visit to Germany in March that Malaysia’s links were with Hamas’s political wing and not with its military arm.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/241763/malaysia-summons-meta-over-removed-pm-posts-about-hamas-leader
Iran says has ‘legal right’ to punish Israel,"Iran said Monday it has the ‘legal right’ to respond to the assassination in Tehran last week of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, an attack blamed on Israel amid the Gaza war. ‘No one has the right to doubt Iran’s legal right to punish the Zionist regime’, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani told a regular news conference, referring to Israel. He maintained that Iran ‘does not seek to aggravate tensions in the region’, which have soared since the Israel-Hamas war broke out in early October and rose further since Wednesday’s attack in Tehran. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said Israel killed Haniyeh using a ‘short-range projectile’ launched from outside his residence in the Iranian capital which he was visiting to attend the inauguration of President Masoud Pezeshkian. Iran and Hamas as well as other Tehran-aligned armed groups in the Middle East have vowed to retaliate. Israel has not directly commented on the killing, which came just hours the assassination of Lebanese militant group Hezbollah’s military chief Fuad Shukr in an Israeli strike on Beirut. Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israeli forces have traded near-daily fire since early October. Calls for de-escalation have intensified following the high-profile killings, with world powers fearing an all-out regional war. Kanani on Monday said: ‘We believe the consolidation of stability and security in the region will be achieved by punishing the aggressor and creating a deterrent against the adventurous behaviour and extraterritorial terrors of the Zionist regime’. Iran, which does not recognise Israel, has held talks with multiple Arab countries including Jordan, Egypt, Oman and Qatar since Haniyeh’s killing. Tehran has repeatedly reaffirmed its ‘inherent right’ to take action against foe Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his country was at ‘a very high level’ of preparedness for any scenario, ‘defensive and offensive’.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/241762/iran-says-has-legal-right-to-punish-israel
"All offices, educational institutions to reopen from Tuesday","All government, semi-government, autonomous and semi-autonomous offices, private establishments and educational institutions will reopen from Tuesday while curfew will remain in force till 6:00am on the day, said a press release of Inter Services Public Relations Directorate issued on Monday night. The announcement came hours after Sheikh Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled to India amid mass uprising led by student protesters. The government on Sunday declared a three-day general holiday across the country from today and extended the curfew for an indefinite period from Sunday 6:00pm. The government on July 16 announced the indefinite closure of all secondary, and higher secondary level educational institutions. On July 16, the University Grants Commission of Bangladesh also requested all the public and private universities to keep their institutions closed and vacate students’ residential halls until further notice. On the same day, the National University authorities also closed down all colleges under it for an indefinite period. On July 17, the primary and mass education ministry announced the indefinite closure of government primary schools in areas under the jurisdiction of city corporations and later on July 20 it announced closure of all primary schools. The government this Saturday backtracked on its decision of resuming academic activities in all government primary schools across Bangladesh except city corporation areas from Sunday.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/Country/241761/all-offices-educational-institutions-to-reopen-from-tuesday
Australian swimmer Titmus to take ‘extended break’,"Four-time Olympic gold medallist Ariarne Titmus said  Monday she will take an ‘extended break’ from swimming with the aim of being back to her best for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. The Australian, who won two golds and two silver medals at the Paris Olympics, said she may spend up to a year away from the sport as she looks to recharge her batteries. ‘I’m definitely having a very extended break. I haven’t planned when I’m going back to swimming. I want to go back when I feel ready to go back. Could be up to 12 months,’ she told news agency reporters on Monday. Titmus, who won gold in the 400 metres freestyle and the 4x200m freestyle relay in Paris, along with silver in the 200m and 800m freestyle, will turn 24 next month and is keen to be fresh and ready in four years time. ‘I just want to make sure I’m ready to go in LA. I don’t want to come back too early and, you know, lose that fire, I guess,’ she said. ‘I think four years is a long time, so I want to prepare myself the best for those Olympic Games. For me, that’s the priority, not world championships in the years prior. ‘So I just want to really have time to let the hunger build back up and enjoy myself for a little while,’ she said. Titmus’ great rival, American Katie Ledecky, has said she aims to continue on for a fifth Olympics which would set up another series of their contests. While Titmus has beaten Ledecky to gold in the past two Olympic 400m events, the American, who is 27, has won four straight golds in the 800m. The Tasmanian said she was glad their duel looked to set to resume. ‘t’s always exciting racing the best in the world and I think we get the best out of each other,’ she said. ‘You know, it’s more satisfying racing a champion like her and being successful than not. So I think it’d be crazy for her not to try and keep going for her home games. ‘And yes, it’s another challenge, it is always a challenge racing her so I look forward to it,’ she added. With Canadian teenager Summer McIntosh having emerged as a major star, with two golds in Paris, Titmus feels women’s swimming is in a golden era. ‘I think that at the moment, it’s probably, since I can remember, the best it’s ever been in terms of how fast we’re swimming, the depth we have across the world, the depth in Australia,’ she said. ‘So I feel very privileged and have a sense of pride to contribute to that at the moment. I think people are going to look back on this era of swimming and say that it was one of the best.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/others/241757/australian-swimmer-titmus-to-take-extended-break
IBA stripped of boxing claims gender-row fighters ‘are male’,"The International Boxing Association claimed Monday at a chaotic press conference that tests on two boxers at the centre of a gender controversy at the Paris Olympics show they ‘are male’. The IBA said previously that it disqualified Algeria’s Imane Khelif and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting from its 2023 world championships after the fighters failed gender eligibility tests, without specifying what the tests were. The boxing in the French capital is run by the International Olympic Committee because of financial, governance and ethical concerns at the IBA. The IOC cleared the two boxers to fight and both are in the semi-finals and therefore guaranteed a medal. The two organisations have been in open dispute. An IBA press conference in Paris was designed to clarify what tests Khelif and Lin underwent last year, and what the results showed. IBA officials including Kremlin-linked Russian oligarch Umar Kremlev, the organisation’s president, who was on a remote video call, gave a series of contradictory statements to a room packed full of reporters. The officials said they were also constrained by medical confidentiality. What was clear was when Ioannis Filippatos, former chairman of the IBA’s medical committee, said ‘abnormalities’ were detected in blood tests in 2022. The two boxers were tested again in 2023 to confirm the initial findings, IBA officials said, and after that they were disqualified. ‘The medical result, blood result, looks -- and the laboratory says -- that these boxers are male,’ said Filippatos. ‘The problem is that we have two blood exams with karyotype of male. This is the answer from the laboratory.’ A karyotype is an individual’s complete set of chromosomes, according to the National Human Genome Research Institute in the United States. IOC president Thomas Bach and high-level officials from Algeria and Taiwan have strenuously defended Khelif and Lin, saying they were born and raised as women, and have passports saying that. The Olympic body, which has effectively expelled the IBA from the Olympic movement, has accused the IBA of making ‘an arbitrary decision’ over disqualifying the duo in 2023. Khelif and Lin also fought at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, but did not win a medal and competed without controversy.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/others/241756/iba-stripped-of-boxing-claims-gender-row-fighters-are-male
Important tasks that lie before interim government,"THE authoritarian government of the Awami League has been overthrown by the democratically oriented student and mass movement and the deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina has fled the country in half an hour after her resignation. Earlier, several hundred people were killed, several thousand people, including student protesters and ordinary citizens, were wounded in attacks by the Awami League’s fronts and various law enforcement units in weeks of protests centring on reforms in civil service job reservations and thousands of people, including students and people in the opposition, were arrested amidst the protests. After the resolution of the job reservation issue by the government on a court order and in the wake of fresh demands that came up but have remained unmet, the students, joined in by people from all walks of life, took to the streets overwhelmingly and, finally, in the face of the government’s decision to deal with the protesters with an iron fist, came out on the streets in their thousands defying a curfew, demanding the resignation of the government of the Awami League. And, in the situation that emerged, Hasina left amidst the people’s student uprising. The army chief General Waker-uz-Zaman in a brief speech has, meanwhile, assured people of the trial of all the killings that took place during the protests and promised that an interim government would be formed in consultation with the president to restore peace and order. It appears that the army chief has negotiated the exit of the deposed prime minister and the formation of an interim government. Whilst we will be waiting for the composition of the interim government and representation of segments of society in it, we would want to remind the government that would be formed that so many people have laid down their lives, more than 300 hundred, not only to replace one government with another government but to bring about major democratic reforms in political and economic systems of the country. What yet remains a major task for the government is to deterrently deal with violence and to ensure the safety and security of the people, in general, and minorities, religious or ethnic, as they remain the most vulnerable to majoritarianism in such a precarious time. It is, therefore, of utmost importance for the government to protect the property, establishments and places of worship of the minorities and head off any repression on them. Besides, what remains the prime task for the new government is to conduct a credible investigation of corruption of all sorts, financial irregularities, illicit capital flow that has drained the economy, enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killing, violation of rights and all such ills that took place during the consecutive tenures of the government of the Awami League since its assumption of office in 2009 and publish a white paper on all this for all citizens to know. The interim government must, therefore, take early steps to do all this and make the unseating of the Awami League government meaningful on a path towards the democratic aspirations of the people.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/241753/important-tasks-that-lie-before-interim-government
Call money market remains inert,"The interbank call money rate has remained low and barely effective recently, as banks have reluctant to lend money to each other due to a shortage of funds. Bangladesh Bank data showed that the average call money rate reached 8.72 per cent on August 4, with banks borrowing only Tk 4,565 crore that day. Banks borrowed on an average only Tk 3,200 crore in between July 25 to July 31. Banks have been struggling with severe liquidity shortages for a couple of years, and the recent unrests in the country has worsened the situation, bankers said. Consequently, most banks are unwilling to lend to other banks because their funds are insufficient for their own operations, they said. On May 8, the central bank increased its key policy rate by 50 basis points to 8.50 per cent as part of its contractionary monetary policy. The special repo rate, or standing lending facility (SLF), which is the ceiling on the interest rate corridor, was also raised by 50 basis points to 10 per cent. Meanwhile, the reverse repo rate, or standing deposit facility (SDF), was raised by 50 basis points to 7 per cent. On the same day, the central bank scrapped its SMART rate policy for determining the lending rate and shifted to a market-based approach under pressure from the International Monetary Fund. Following this change, the lending rate increased to nearly 15 per cent. Banks borrowed a record Tk 25,000 crore from the central bank to meet a high demand for deposit withdrawals amid countrywide turmoil and curfews centring the anti-government protest programmes held by the Anti-Discrimination Students Movement. The country has been put under a curfew since midnight past July 19 amid the unrests centring students’ demands for a reform in the quota system in the government jobs. Banking and other business activities had come to a standstill, which affected the general people and depositors as they had run out of cash. The curfew was relaxed on July 24 to allow offices and banks to operate for a limited time. However, all offices resumed normal schedules on July 31. However, the government cancelled relaxation of curfew and re-imposed extended curfew for an indefinite period. It also announced general holidays for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, keeping all offices, including banks, shut. The call money rate is the interest rate on a short-term or overnight loan from one bank to another to meet an urgent requirement. Banks typically resort to emergency loans like call money to rectify asset-liability mismatches, fulfil statutory CRR and SLR requirements and respond to sudden surges in fund demands. The call money rate began its sharp ascent after March 21, 2022, when it stood at 2.05 per cent, according to the BB data. Increased liquidity pressures have led to a steady rise in the weighted average call money rate since June past year, when it had stood at 6 per cent. But, after rising to near 9 per cent, it has been hovering at the rate for the past three months as banks liquidity crisis intensified. Bankers said that the government’s increased borrowing from the banking system, BB’s dollar sales to banks to settle import bills and a rise in treasury bill rates were creating stress on the liquidity. The rise in inflation also created credit demand, they said Bangladesh’s overall inflation rate reached 9.7 per cent in June, remaining over 9 per cent since March 2023.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/241752/call-money-market-remains-inert
RMG factories to remain closed today: BGMEA,"The country’s apparel makers have decided to keep their factories closed today for the safety of workers and employees. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association at a meeting held at Westin Hotel in the capital Dhaka on Monday instructed all its members to close their respective units on Tuesday. The BGMEA also said that they would convene another meeting on Tuesday (today) to decide whether the factories would resume on Wednesday. Meanwhile, one of the BGMEA directors Shams Mahmud said that the factories should remain closed until formation of an interim government in the country. Under the present situation, it is important to think about the safety of the workers and factories, he said. Earlier on Sunday, the BGMEA and Bangladesh Textile Mills Association asked all their member units to close factories until further instruction amid a curfew and student movement. Amid the unrest, Sinha Textile, Beximco Synthetics, a warehouse of scrapped clothing items (jhoot) of Ha-Meem Group, and Bengal Plastic at Zirani in Ashulia and Outpace Spinning in Gazipur were set on fire on Sunday. Factories remained shut from July 20 as a curfew was imposed across the country from midnight past July 19 due to the clashes across the country over quota reform protests, starting from July 16.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/apparel/241751/rmg-factories-to-remain-closed-today-bgmea
Indonesian growth slows in Q2,"Indonesia’s economy grew more slowly in the second quarter of 2024 despite being supported by spending on religious holidays and increased household consumption, the country’s statistics agency said on Monday. Growth in Southeast Asia’s largest economy was 5.05 per cent in the second quarter, slightly lower than the previous quarter’s 5.11 per cent, Statistics Indonesia said. ‘The economic growth is also lower compared to the second quarter of 2023,’ Statistics Indonesia deputy head, Mohamad Edy Mahmud told a press conference. Despite the lower growth, Statistics Indonesia insisted the domestic economy is relatively robust and stable — but some economists doubted the country can maintain such growth. ‘We don’t have much faith in the official data,’ said Gareth Leather, senior Asia economist at Capital Economics. ‘We don’t think this recovery will last. We expect growth to slow over the coming months.’ Indonesia’s central bank earlier this year announced a surprise interest rate hike to 6.25 per cent, the highest for seven years, to support the rupiah, which had weakened against the dollar.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/241750/indonesian-growth-slows-in-q2
Warnings rise about AI models,"When academic Jathan Sadowski reached for an analogy last year to describe how AI programmes decay, he landed on the term ‘Habsburg AI’. The Habsburgs were one of Europe’s most powerful royal houses, but entire sections of their family line collapsed after centuries of inbreeding. Recent studies have shown how AI programmes underpinning products like ChatGPT go through a similar collapse when they are repeatedly fed their own data. ‘I think the term Habsburg AI has aged very well,’ Sadowski told AFP, saying his coinage had ‘only become more relevant for how we think about AI systems’. The ultimate concern is that AI-generated content could take over the web, which could in turn render chatbots and image generators useless and throw a trillion-dollar industry into a tailspin. But other experts argue that the problem is overstated, or can be fixed. And many companies are enthusiastic about using what they call synthetic data to train AI programmes. This artificially generated data is used to augment or replace real-world data. It is cheaper than human-created content but more predictable. ‘The open question for researchers and companies building AI systems is: how much synthetic data is too much,’ said Sadowski, lecturer in emerging technologies at Australia’s Monash University. Training AI programmes, known in the industry as large language models, involves scraping vast quantities of text or images from the internet. This information is broken into trillions of tiny machine-readable chunks, known as tokens. When asked a question, a programme like ChatGPT selects and assembles tokens in a way that its training data tells it is the most likely sequence to fit with the query. But even the best AI tools generate falsehoods and nonsense, and critics have long expressed concern about what would happen if a model was fed on its own outputs. In late July, a paper in the journal Nature titled ‘AI models collapse when trained on recursively generated data’ proved a lightning rod for discussion. The authors described how models quickly discarded rarer elements in their original dataset and, as Nature reported, outputs degenerated into ‘gibberish’. A week later, researchers from Rice and Stanford universities published a paper titled ‘Self-consuming generative models go MAD’ that reached a similar conclusion. They tested image-generating AI programmes and showed that outputs become more generic and strafed with undesirable elements as they added AI-generated data to the underlying model. They labelled model collapse ’Model Autophagy Disorder’ or MAD and compared it to mad cow disease, a fatal illness caused by feeding the remnants of dead cows to other cows. These researchers worry that AI-generated text, images and video are clearing the web of usable human-made data. ‘One doomsday scenario is that if left uncontrolled for many generations, MAD could poison the data quality and diversity of the entire internet,’ one of the Rice University authors, Richard Baraniuk, said in a statement. However, industry figures are unfazed. Anthropic and Hugging Face, two leaders in the field who pride themselves on taking an ethical approach to the technology, both told AFP they used AI-generated data to fine-tune or filter their datasets. Anton Lozhkov, machine learning engineer at Hugging Face, said the Nature paper gave an interesting theoretical perspective but its disaster scenario was not realistic. ‘Training on multiple rounds of synthetic data is simply not done in reality,’ he said. However, he said researchers were just as frustrated as everyone else with the state of the internet. ‘A large part of the internet is trash,’ he said, adding that Hugging Face already made huge efforts to clean data — sometimes jettisoning as much as 90 per cent. He hoped that web users would help clear up the internet by simply not engaging with generated content. ‘I strongly believe that humans will see the effects and catch generated data way before models will,’ he said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/241749/warnings-rise-about-ai-models
"US services activity rebound on business, new orders boost","The US services sector bounced back in July on stronger business activity, new orders and employment, according to survey data released Monday. The Institute for Supply Management’s services index stood at 51.4 per cent last month, up from 48.8 per cent in June. The number was slightly above the analyst consensus forecast of 51.3 per cent according to Briefing.com, and above the 50-point threshold separating growth from contraction. ‘Economic activity in the services sector expanded in July, a trend that has been interrupted only three times — though twice in the last four months — since early in the coronavirus pandemic,’ said the ISM report. ‘Survey respondents again reported that increased costs are impacting their businesses,’ said ISM survey chair Steve Miller. Miller added: ‘Comments continued to express a wait-and-see attitude regarding the upcoming presidential election, with one respondent expressing concern over potential increases in tariffs.’ In July, the business activity index rose 4.9 percentage points to 54.5 per cent, while the new orders index picked up 5.1 percentage points to 52.4 per cent. Meanwhile, the employment index, up five percentage points to 51.1 per cent, expanded for the second time in 2024, ISM added. Ten services industries reported growth, while eight reported a decrease.

UK beekeepers and scientists tackle sticky problem of honey fraud,"Lynne Ingram cuts a peaceful figure as she tends to a row of humming beehives in a leafy corner of Somerset, southwest England. But the master beekeeper, who has been keeping hives for more than 40 years, has found herself in a fight against a tricky and evolving foe — honey fraudsters. The practice of adulterating honey is well known, and historically adulterants such as ash and potato flour have been used. Now, advancements in technology and science have made it much easier, with ‘bespoke, designer or bioengineered’ syrups used as diluting agents capable of fooling authenticity tests, Ingram said. She founded the UK Honey Authenticity Network (HAN UK) in 2021 to raise awareness about natural honey and warn of the threat posed by fraud. ‘One of the impacts we’re seeing all over the world is beekeepers going out of business,’ she said. Adulterated honey can be sold to retailers for a price several times lower than genuine producers can afford. As well as producing their own honey, many larger-scale beekeepers have crop pollination contracts with farmers, delivering thousands of colonies to growers across the country. If they go out of business due to unfair competition, this vital natural method of pollinating crops is reduced and food production suffers. The British Beekeepers Association, which represents more than 25,000 producers and where Ingram is a honey ambassador, wants the risk of fraud to be recognised to protect the industry and consumers. ‘I’d like to see an acknowledgement that there is actually an issue here,’ she said. In May, the European Union updated its honey regulations to ensure clearer product labelling and a ‘honey traceability system’ to increase transparency. On the labelling for blended honeys, for example, all countries of origin are now required to appear near a product’s name, where previously it was only mandatory to state whether blending had occurred. Labelling in the UK, which has now left the EU, is not as stringent and Ingram believes consumers are ‘being misled’ by vague packaging. Behind the EU action is an apparent increase in adulterated honey arriving in the 27-nation bloc. The substandard adulterates can have adverse effects on consumers’ health, such as raising the risk of diabetes, obesity, and liver or kidney damage. Between 2021 and 2022, 46 per cent of the honey tested as it entered the EU was flagged as potentially fraudulent, up from 14 per cent in the 2015-17 period. Of the suspicious consignments, 74 per cent were of Chinese origin. Honey imported from the UK had a 100-per cent suspicion rate. The EU said this honey was probably produced in third countries and blended again in the UK before being sent to the bloc. The UK is the second largest importer of honey in terms of volume in the whole of Europe. China is its top supplier. Not all of the UK’s imported honey leaves the country, however. Considerable quantities stay on the domestic market. ‘We think there’s an awful lot of it on the shelves,’ said Ingram, adding that adulterated honey was ‘widely available’ in big supermarkets. Behind the closed blinds of a research laboratory at Aston University in Birmingham, central England, researchers fighting honey fraud are harnessing cutting-edge technology. Aston scientists and beekeepers, including Ingram, are using light to reveal the contents of honey samples at the molecular level. The technique — known as Fluorescence Excitation-Emission Spectroscopy (FLE) — involves firing lasers into samples. The light frequencies re-emitted are then collated into a three-dimensional image — or ‘molecular fingerprint’ — of the honey tested. Alex Rozhin, the project lead and a reader in nanotechnology, said the test ‘can trace different molecules through the spectrum and confirm which type of biochemicals are present’. In the darkened lab, the light from different honeys is clearly visible. The first gives off a vivid green and the second a cooler blue, indicating distinct chemical compositions. Using FLE, Rozhin says his team ‘can immediately trace a concentration of fraud inside samples’ with ‘different spectral bands corresponding to syrup (or) to natural honey’. Rozhin said FLE is more accurate than existing tests and can provide results far quicker, at a greatly reduced cost and without the need for highly trained personnel. One of the Aston team’s aims is to create a version of FLE that can be used by honey producers or even consumers with scaled-down equipment or eventually just a smartphone. Rolling the test out like this would also accelerate the creation of a honey database which, through machine learning, could be used as a catalogue of biometric signatures. ‘If we get a new sample and it’s been tampered with and it’s different from how the database is built up, we’ll know there’s something obscure,’ said Steven Daniels, an Aston research associate specialising in machine learning. Ingram said the test could close international gaps in testing methods by establishing a unified standard, but the government needed to monitor the sector too. ‘We really need to get to grips with this,’ she said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/241747/uk-beekeepers-and-scientists-tackle-sticky-problem-of-honey-fraud
Turkish inflation falls to 61.78pc in July,"Turkey’s annual inflation rate slowed sharply in July to 61.78 per cent, official data showed on Monday, as the country battles a cost-of-living crisis. It is the second consecutive fall after consumer price rises eased to 71.6 per cent in June. ‘Annual inflation is falling,’ finance minister Mehmet Simsek said on the social media platform X. ‘We continue to get positive results in all areas of our programme, whose main objective is disinflation,’ he said. ‘The decrease in inflation will be felt more in the coming period.’ The central bank began to raise interest rates last year in an effort to battle inflation, after president Recep Tayyip Erdogan dropped his opposition to orthodox monetary policy. The bank kept borrowing costs unchanged at 50 per cent for a fourth consecutive month in July. Inflation traditionally eases during summer in Turkey, as energy consumption falls and tourism brings in foreign currencies. ‘The large fall in headline inflation in Turkey in July will provide some comfort to the central bank that the disinflation process remains on track,’ said Nicholas Farr, emerging Europe economist at London-based research group Capital Economics. But, he added, ‘it will take time for policymakers to be fully convinced that they can begin easing monetary conditions’. While the annual inflation rate eased in July, it rose by 3.23 per cent compared to June. It had increased by 1.64 per cent on a monthly basis in June. Education, housing, health, and hotel and restaurants saw the biggest price increases. Turkey’s annual inflation rate reached a decades-long high of 85 per cent in October 2022 and then fell off before resuming a steady climb. It rose to 75 per cent in May this year before falling again. The central bank expects inflation to reach 43.5 per cent by the end of the year and slow further to 25.5 per cent in 2025. ‘We maintain our forecast for the first interest rate cut to arrive in 2025, a bit later than most others expect,’ Farr said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/241746/turkish-inflation-falls-to-61.78pc-in-july
"TikTok, bowing to EU, withdraws rewards programme","TikTok will permanently remove a feature in a spinoff app in France and Spain that rewards users for watching and liking videos, bowing to pressure from European regulators, the EU and the Chinese-owned company said Monday. TikTok Lite arrived in France and Spain — the only EU countries where it is available — in April this year. Users aged 18 and over can earn points to exchange for goods like vouchers or gift cards through the app’s rewards programme. ‘We have obtained the permanent withdrawal of TikTok Lite Rewards programme, which could have had very addictive consequences,’ the EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, said. TikTok Lite is a smaller version of the popular TikTok app, taking up less memory in a smartphone and made to perform over slower internet connections. TikTok made commitments to remove the programme from the 27-country bloc and not to launch ‘any other programme which would circumvent the withdrawal’, the European Commission said in a statement. It is the first major victory for the European Union’s landmark Digital Services Act, a sweeping new law that requires digital firms operating in the bloc to effectively police online content to protect users from harm. The commission kickstarted an investigation into the Lite app in April amid concerns over ‘addictive’ effects, which forced TikTok to temporarily suspend the programme. The case is now closed after TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, made the binding commitments. Any breach of the promises could lead to heavy fines under the DSA. ‘We will carefully monitor TikTok’s compliance. Today’s decision also sends a clear message to the entire social media industry,’ said commission executive vice president, Margrethe Vestager. TikTok confirmed it had ‘now withdrawn’ the rewards programme. ‘We always seek to engage constructively with the European Commission and other regulators. TikTok is pleased to have reached an amicable resolution,’ a company spokesperson said. TikTok is still under investigation after a separate probe launched in February amid concerns TikTok may not be doing enough to address negative impacts on young people. TikTok is among 25 ‘very large’ online platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, that must comply with the DSA’s stricter rules since August 2023. The rules also expect digital retailers to act effectively to protect shoppers online. The DSA gives the EU the power to hit companies with fines as high as six per cent of their global annual revenues. Repeat offenders can see their platforms blocked in the EU. There are also ongoing investigations into X, formerly Twitter; Chinese online retailer AliExpress; and Meta over its Facebook and Instagram platforms. TikTok also faces a litany of problems across the Atlantic. It has filed a lawsuit to stop a US law that forces the app to be sold next year or face a US ban, claiming it violates First Amendment rights of free speech. The United States upped the pressure on TikTok with a lawsuit last week, accusing the app of violating children’s privacy by collecting data about them without their parents’ permission when they use the platform. TikTok said it disagreed with the allegations and that the company had safeguards to ensure age-appropriate experiences.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/241745/tiktok-bowing-to-eu-withdraws-rewards-programme
"Hasina meets Ajit Doval, may seek UK asylum: Indian media","Sheikh Hasina, who resigned from her position as Bangladesh prime minister on Monday, met with Indian national security advisor Ajit Doval at the Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, approximately 30km from Delhi, NDTV reported.

"German chip maker Infineon to cut 1,400 jobs","German chip maker Infineon said Monday it will slash 1,400 jobs and relocate 1,400 more due to a tough market environment, as it announced falling profits and downgraded its outlook. The job cuts, from a workforce of about 58,600 worldwide, are part of a company-wide restructuring that was launched in May. The programme is aimed at ‘strengthening our competitiveness’, said CEO Jochen Hanebeck in a statement, alongside the release of results for the third quarter of the group’s financial year. A spokesman confirmed to AFP that the jobs would be cut and relocated to locations with lower costs, without giving further details. The news comes after US chip giant Intel announced last week it will slash more than 15 per cent of its workforce as it seeks to cut about $20 billion in expenses this year. Infineon reported a net profit of 403 million euros ($441 million) in the three months to the end of June, down 52 per cent from a year earlier. Revenues came in at 3.7 billion euros, down from about 4.1 billion a year earlier. The group downgraded its outlook for 2024, and now expects revenues of around 15 billion euros. That is the third downgrade in recent times, with Infineon having earlier expected sales of about 16 billion euros. ‘The recovery in our target markets is progressing only slowly,’ said Hanebeck. He referred to ‘prolonged weak economic momentum’ but insisted that Infineon continues to ‘hold up well’ in a ‘challenging’ market environment. Revenues in its ‘green industrial power’ and ‘power and sensor systems’ divisions fell heavily in the quarter from a year earlier but sales in its automotive division were stable.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/241743/german-chip-maker-infineon-to-cut-1400-jobs

"Residences of PM, CJ among establishments vandalized across Bangladesh","Agitating people on Monday vandalised and set fire to different establishments, including official residences of the prime minister and chief justice, soon after Sheikh Hasina resigned as prime minister amid massive protests across the country. Clashes between the police and mobs and arson left at least nine people dead and dozens injured across the country after the fall of the government on Monday. New Age correspondent in Jashore reported that a five-star hotel Zaber International was set on fire at 3:00pm in Jashore town,  minutes after the prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s resignation was announced, killing nine people and injuring at least 50 others. The hotel is owned by ruling Awami League Jashore district unit general secretary Shaheen Chaklader. Confirming the deaths from the attack, Jahsore General Hospital duty doctor Saifur Rahman said that 35 were admitted to the hospital with burn injuries. In Dhaka, the people opened gates of Ganabhaban, the official residence of the prime minister, and entered inside the residence at about 3:00pm soon after Sheikh Hasina left Ganabhaban for a safer place. A group of people looted almost everything, including furniture from Ganabhaban and carried out vandalism there. Besides, a group of miscreants also looted and vandalised the official residence of chief justice Obaidul Hassan in the capital. A number of police stations also came under attacks, vandalism, and fire by the agitating people in the capital and elsewhere in the country, while incidents of looting also took place at some police stations. The people also allegedly vandalised and torched offices of the Awami League and its associate organisations across the country, while incidents of attacks on the houses and establishments owned by AL people across the country were also reported. The mob also attacked police headquarters and the Dhaka South City Corporation in the city. Angry mobs also went on a rampage at different television offices, including Ekattor Television, ATN Bangla, and My TV, and looted valuables from the offices. Even, some TV channels were forced to stop airing programmes amid the situation. They set fire to the Awami League president’s office at Dhanmondi, AL central office on Bangabandhu Avenue, Bangabandhu Bhaban, known as the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum at Dhanmondi-32, AL Dhaka district office, Sudha Sadan at Dhanmondi, Jatiya Party central office at Kakrail, Police headquarters, Dhaka south city corporation building, Rajshahi Metropolitan Police Headquarters, and Rajshahi Nagar Bhaban. Angry people also vandalised inside Sangsad Bhaban, the houses of AL lawmakers, ministers across the country, including houses of home minister Asaduzzaman Khan at Dhanmondi, food minister Sadhan Chandra Majumder, and lawmakers Mashrafe Bin Mortaza and Shamim Osman. Sheikh Hasina resigned early Monday and left the country for Agartala in India via helicopter. The figure of deaths and injured was updated as of 10:30pm Monday. In Narsigndi, at least 29 people were injured in police firing when a mob tried to attack the superintendent of police office in the district town at about 6:00pm, New Age correspondent in the district reported.

Global stock markets plunge on US recession fears,"Wall Street stocks deepened their losses Monday and Tokyo had its worst day in 13 years as panic spread across trading floors over fears of recession in the United States. Wall Street’s tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index tumbled 6.3 per cent at the open, with the S&P 500 falling 4.2 per cent and the Dow dropping 2.7 per cent. Major European indices were down around three per cent in afternoon trading. Tokyo’s Nikkei tanked more than 12 per cent in its worst day since the Fukushima crisis in 2011. It also suffered its biggest ever points loss, shedding 4,451.28. The market meltdown was triggered by a weak US jobs report on Friday which showed the unemployment rate reached its highest since October 2021. The report came two days after the US Federal Reserved decided, as expected, to keep interest rates at a 23-year high while signalling that it could cut them in September. ‘Investors are gripped by fears that the Federal Reserve has waited too long to pivot on its policy, especially in light of Friday’s disappointing US jobs data and a slew of other weak economic indicators pointing toward a looming recession,’ said market analyst Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and FOREX.com. Friday’s much-anticipated report showed the US economy added just 114,000 jobs last month, well down from June and far fewer than expected, and unemployment at 4.3 per cent. The news came a day after lacklustre factory data. Investors fear the Fed’s high rates, which aimed to slash inflation, could be plunging the economy towards a hard landing and recession instead of the soft landing sought by the central bank. Expectations that the Fed could cut more aggressively than expected from September, or even be forced into an emergency reduction this month, sent the dollar sliding against the yen. The Japanese currency was boosted also by a Bank of Japan interest-rate hike last week, analysts said. The dollar went under 142 yen for the first time since January. Markets tumbled across the board Monday, with Brent North Sea crude reaching the lowest level in more than six months despite heightened Middle East tensions, while bitcoin slumped more than 10 per cent to under $50,000. ‘Aside from ongoing worries about a US recession, the continuation of the pressure on markets has been attributed to unwinding of the yen carry trade and geopolitical fears surrounding an expected Iranian military retaliation against Israel after Israel killed a high-ranking Iranian military official,’ said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O’Hare. Many investors have borrowed at low interest rates in a weak yen to invest in higher yielding currencies, but the abrupt surge in the yen as well as interest rate moves is upending the trade. Some analysts pointed to the ‘Sahm rule’, which says an economy is in the early stages of recession if the three-month moving average of unemployment is 0.5 per centage points above its low over the previous 12 months. That was triggered by Friday’s data. O’Hare also noted big falls in tech and semiconductor shares. That helped fuel sharp drops in Asia markets and US tech shares were also pulling down Wall Street indices. Shares in AI chip manufacturer Nvidia plunged 14.6 per cent at the start of trading on Monday. Shares in Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta slumped 7.2 per cent. Microsoft and Google parent company Alphabet shares were down around five per cent.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/Stocks/241740/global-stock-markets-plunge-on-us-recession-fears
Hasina will not come back in politics: Sajeeb,"The Awami League president Sheikh Hasina’s son Sajeeb Wazed Joy said that his mother, who stepped down on Monday, would not comeback in politics. In an interview with the BBC World Service, he said that his mother was so disappointed as after all her hard work, a group of people rose up against her. Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country amid the countrywide student protests that initially began demanding the reform of quota system in the government jobs, which claimed around 350 lives. Speaking to Newshour on the BBC World Service, Joy, an official adviser of the former prime minister, said that his mother was considering resigning since Sunday, and left the country for her own safety after her family insisted. There will be no political comeback of his mother, the BBC report said, adding that Joy’s mother was so disappointed that after all her hard work, for a minority to rise up against her. Defending his mother’s record in power, Joy said, ‘She has turned Bangladesh around. When she took over power, it was considered a failing state. It was a poor country. Until today, it was considered one of the rising tigers of Asia. She’s very disappointed.’ Rejecting accusations that the government had been heavy-handed in dealing with protestors, Joy said, ‘You’ve had policemen beaten to death – 13 just yesterday.

Sprint king Lyles confident of Olympic treble in Paris,"Newly minted Olympic 100m champion Noah Lyles has his sights on triple gold at the Paris Games. Lyles came out on top of a thrilling race at the Stade de France Sunday that ended in a photo-finish to open his golden account. The American was awarded victory over Jamaican Kishane Thompson by just five-thousandths of a second in the closest finish in modern Olympic history. Lyles won three golds at last year's world championships in Budapest and the 27-year-old said he was eyeing a repeat in the French capital. ‘I'm pretty confident, I can't lie,’ said Lyles. He is seeking to emulate Usain Bolt, the last sprinter to achieve the treble. The Jamaican legend did it at the 2016 Rio Games, having also done it four years previously in London. ‘Kenny (Bednarek) definitely put up a fast time (in the 200m) at trials and that definitely woke me up -- and I was very proud of him. ‘He's definitely not going to take how he did here in the 100m lying down. He's going to say 'I'm going after it in the 200m' because he knows he can go after it.’ But Lyles had a message for any pretenders to the crown in the 200m, an event in which he is reigning three-time world champion. ‘I'll be winning!’ he said. ‘None of them is winning. When I come off the turn, They will be depressed.’ Lyles' winning time in the 100m was a personal best, but he'd known something was cooking after timing 9.83sec in the semi-finals. ‘When I saw that, I know I'm going to be difficult to beat, I'm about to set a personal record,’ he said. ‘I called my therapist and she was like, 'you need to let go, you need to let it flow', and I was like, 'alright I'm going to trust you'.’ The therapy certainly worked and set Lyles up perfectly for a tilt at a treble, with the 4x100m relay to follow the 200m, round one of which is on Monday. Lyles came away from the Covid-delayed Tokyo Games with just a bronze in the 200m, something he said left him with burning in his chest. But he was adamant that he had changed in the three years since then. ‘Oh gosh, this is definitely a different Noah, 100 percent,’ said Lyles, who has openly talked about his struggles with mental health and depression in recent years. ‘I'm definitely not depressed. Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely feeling normal stress. I definitely feel the moment. It's a lot to deal with. ‘I think back to Tokyo when I messed up handling the rounds. From then on, I was like, 'I'm never going to do that again. I'm going to handle this correctly and practise over the years'.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/others/241732/sprint-king-lyles-confident-of-olympic-treble-in-paris

"After France split, Nemour wins gymnastics gold for Algeria","Kaylia Nemour claimed an historic gold for Algeria on Sunday after a stunning performance on uneven bars two years after being denied a place on the team of her native France on medical grounds. Driven by her desire for Olympic glory, the 17-year-old switched to represent her father's country Algeria. ‘I had put the Olympic medal as my screen saver on my phone. I think I'll change it to put the real one,’ said a smiling Nemour after her daring high-flying acrobatic routine brushed aside her rivals at Bercy Arena to claim a first gymnastics medal for Africa. Her score of 15.700 pushed China's Qiu Qiyuan, who had taken the world title ahead of her last year, into the silver medal position, with American Sunisa Lee snatching bronze. Gymnastics great Simone Biles did not make it past qualifying on the apparatus a week ago in which Nemour lead the way. As Nemour soared in Paris, the French gymnastics team slumped at their home Olympics with none of the women's competitors qualifying for the apparatus finals. On Sunday, France's only remaining gymnastics hope in the Paris Olympics, Samir Ait Said, failed to medal in the men's rings final. ‘It was complicated for them,’ said Nemour. ‘I'm obviously sad for them because I worked alongside the girls of the French team, but that's competition.’ It has been a long road for Nemour. Born in Indre-en-Loire, in central France, she discovered gymnastics at a young age and was quickly spotted by French coaching couple Marc and Gina Chirilcenco. But three years ago, a growth spurt of 14 centimetres (5.5 inches) in a year just after she turned 13 caused a bone problem which required surgery on both knees. Nemour was waiting for the green light to resume competitions but the French federation insisted on a very gradual resumption. A standoff developed and Nemour was excluded from the France team. ‘Clearly, I was angry, sad, I didn't understand, I thought it wasn't fair,’ Nemour told AFP. ‘But my coach says that when you can't go this way, you take another route and there will always be another way. ‘I'm delighted to have won this medal for Algeria. It's the first medal for Africa and I'm proud to have won this medal for them.’ Nemour finished fifth in the all-around in Paris earlier this week. Former Olympic all-around champion Lee was amazed by Nemour's performance in Paris. ‘It was incredible,’ said Lee.  ‘Watching her on bars is like watching a feather. She's flying. It's so light. It just looks so good and it's so fast and so smooth.’ ",https://www.newagebd.net/post/others/241729/after-france-split-nemour-wins-gymnastics-gold-for-algeria

"Khaleda, Tarique urge people to remain calm","Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson Khaleda Zia and its acting chairperson Tarique Rahman on Monday urged the people of the country to remain calm amid the ongoing situation. Khaleda, also a former prime minister who is now undergoing treatment, and Tarique Rahman, who is now in London, came up with the call in a message sent to the media. Besides, in a separate video message Tarique urged the countrymen to remain calm in view of the ongoing situation following the fall of Sheikh Hasina. At the beginning of the video message, Tarique said, ‘Heroic congratulations to the brave students of Bangladesh at this glorious historic moment. Sheikh Hasina has fallen through the historic revolution of the people in exchange for lives of thousands of martyrs.’ The first phase of the people’s revolution was ultimately successful, he said, adding that Bangladesh can never accept defeat, which  was achieved at the cost of millions of martyrs. ‘Through this historic revolution, it has been proved once again that no one can defeat this Bangladesh if they are united regardless of party opinion,’ he said, adding that at this historic moment of victory, he pay his humble respect to those mothers who lost their beloved children in this mass revolution. ‘Thus, during the past 15 years of fascist rule, many children have lost their beloved fathers, many wives have lost their beloved husbands, and countless mothers lost their children. Bangladesh saw another victory on August 5, 2024, in the martyrdom of your children,’ Tarique said from London. He said that many students were injured while making the historic revolution of the people a success and the whole of Bangladesh was with them with all the love in the painful time of treatment at home, hospitals or clinics. ‘Many people have been arrested in false and politically motivated cases while protesting against the government,’ he said, adding that the BNP demands immediate withdrawal of all false cases filed against the agitators and their release from prison. ‘At the same time, I hope the government will take those measures first so that students can return to halls, hostels, classes and take exams normally,’ he said. He said that Bangladesh was turned into a subservient state by taking away the voting rights of 12.5 crore of voters by holding 18 crore people hostage. ‘By toppling the mass killer government, the people have paved the way for the re-establishment of their democracy, human rights, and voting rights,’ he said. ‘Through this, the first phase of the people’s revolution has been successfully completed. After that, the final success of the historic revolution will come through a free and fair election when 12.5 crore of voters of the country can be able to cast their votes safely and confidently they can establish a government accountable to the people,’ he said. He said that a free, fair and impartial election should be organised as soon as possible to reach the final goal of the people’s historic revolution. ‘Power should be transferred as soon as possible to representatives elected by the people. Every democratic political party of Bangladesh, including the BNP will cooperate in all possible ways to organise a free and fair election with the aim of establishing a democratic Bangladesh without discrimination,’ he said. ‘The joy of victory is magnified when the defeated are safe from the winners. So, calmly celebrate this historic moment in this joyous time of victory,’ he said. ‘Please don’t be vindictive. No one should take the law into their own hands. You are called upon to keep a watchful eye so that the victory that is won does not go in vain,’ he said. ‘Students like 1952, 1971 or 1990 have once again created a history of victory. Congratulations again dear countrymen,’ he added. Their messages came as Sheikh Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled the country amid deadly protests across Bangladesh.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/Politics/241727/khaleda-tarique-urge-people-to-remain-calm
Emotional Mahuchikh dedicates gold to slain Ukrainian athletes,"Ukraine's Yaroslava Mahuchikh dedicated her Olympic high jump gold medal on Sunday to the nearly 500 athletes and coaches who have been killed since Russia invaded her country in 2022. The 22-year-old lived up to her pre-Paris Games billing to win the title at the Stade de France. She was more intent on winning to give some pleasure to her compatriots back in her war-torn country than breaking her own world record. The world champion, a bronze medallist in Tokyo three years ago, managed a best of 2.00m to win on countback from Australia's Nicola Olyslagers. Another Australian, Eleanor Patterson, claimed joint bronze together with a second Ukrainian, Iryna Gerashchenko, both on 1.95m. Mahuchikh said her thoughts were with the many athletes and coaches who had lost their lives in the conflict -- they, she said, would never be able to experience an evening like she had had in Paris. ‘You know of course, it's really important,’ she said of the gold medal. ‘But in my country the Russians killed people and almost 500 sportsmen died in this war and they will never compete and celebrate and feel this atmosphere. ‘So I'm happy with the gold medal and it's really for all of them Its really incredible that we have three medals in track and field now.’ Mahuchikh draped herself in the Ukrainian flag and hugged Geraschchenko with the duet briefly doing a celebratory jump up and down with the two Australians on the landing mat. Mahuchikh -- whose mind is constantly on her family's wellbeing back in Dnipro which she says is shelled daily -- nearly fell over as a result but it was the only time in the evening she put a foot wrong. Mahuchikh then went over and gave a tug on the bell in the corner of the stadium and she and Gerashchenko also celebrated with compatriot Myhaylo Kohkan, who had just won bronze in the men's hammer. The trio's achievements earned praise from Ukrainian presiden Volodymyr Zelensky. ‘We are very proud!’ he said. ‘Thank you for this result. Ukrainians know how to be strong and how to win.’ Gerashchenko, 29, added Olympic bronze to the European one she won earlier this year and summed up the trio's feelings. ‘It is amazing it is our night for the Ukrainian people and team.’Wearing her trademark blue and yellow eyeliner -- the colours of the Ukraine flag -- Mahuchikh was nowhere near her 2.10m world record form of the Paris Diamond League last month. That mark beat by 1cm the previous record set by Bulgaria's Stefka Kostadinova in 1987, one of track and field's longest-standing. But her Paris performance on Sunday was enough for Olympic gold, the sole trophy missing from the high jumper's impressive medal haul. ‘Before this Olympics Games, there was a lot of pressure outside but I try not to think about that because i feel comfortable at the track,’ she said. ‘I just enjoyed the atmosphere. I wanted to win the gold, thank god that my coach from my childhood told me that you should jump all heights with first attempts.’ Mahuchikh, who fled the Russian bombardment of her native city of Dnipro in February 2022, claimed world gold in Budapest last year after taking silver in Eugene, the same result she also achieved in Doha in 2019. Because of the war, the Ukrainian had to make a six-day car journey to Belgrade in 2022 where she added the world indoor high jump title to those two world silvers and Olympic bronze she had already collected. This season Mahuchikh also claimed world indoor silver in Glasgow in March. Apart from her sublime jumping the other thing that cuaght the eye was her getting into a sleeping bag in between jumps. ‘I just relax in it because i feel comfortable when I lie down and sometimes I can count numbers, look at the clouds,’ she said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/others/241726/emotional-mahuchikh-dedicates-gold-to-slain-ukrainian-athletes

"Sheikh Hasina lands in India, Indian media says","Sheikh Hasina resigned from her post of prime minister on Monday and swiftly left Bangladesh capital Dhaka. Accompanied by her sister, Sheikh Rehana, she arrived in Agartala, the capital of the Indian state of Tripura, via helicopter, according to the Hindustan Times. The resignation and departure have prompted Indian authorities to issue a high alert at the India-Bangladesh border. The Border Security Force director general has arrived at the border to oversee security measures, ensuring the situation remains under control, the report states. Earlier, the BBC reported that Hasina left the country for Agartala by helicopter, marking a significant shift in the political landscape of Bangladesh. Speaking to the nation, Bangladesh Army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman announced that an interim government would be formed. ‘We will go to the president. Nothing will be achieved through clashes and destruction. Each death will be investigated, and justice will be ensured,’ he emphasised. ‘We had a good discussion with everyone. The prime minister has resigned,’ the Army Chief added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/241722/sheikh-hasina-lands-in-india-indian-media-says
China shrug off doping controversy to win 12 swimming medals,"Pan Zhanle and stalwart Zhang Yufei spearheaded China to 12 Olympic medals in the Paris pool, shrugging off intense scrutiny over a doping controversy that engulfed the team ahead of the Games. Their haul -- two gold, three silver and seven bronze -- was an improvement on their total Tokyo collection of nine. Once again, they finished behind perennial pacesetters the United States and Australia. The team came to Paris under a dark cloud after the New York Times reported in April that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine ahead of Tokyo. China claimed it was the result of food contamination -- an explanation accepted by the World Anti Doping Agency. But US anti-doping authorities angered their Chinese counterparts by accusing WADA of covering up the facts of the case and the scandal overshadowed their preparations. Butterfly ace Zhang, on the scene for a decade with 10 Olympic medals to her name, including five bronze in Paris, was reportedly among the 23 and admitted it had been stressful in France. ‘I competed very well with friends from different countries, now I come to participate in the Olympic Games I am very worried that my good friends look at me with (suspicious) eyes and they do not want to compete with me,’ she said. ‘I am worried that French people think that Chinese athletes do not deserve to stand on this stage.’ In fact, fans at La Defense Arena were respectful, greeting Chinese athletes with applause. Zhang, who again anchored the team, urged any doubters to look at the details of the case. ‘Each one of us was tested 20 to 30 times in two months, three to four times a week on average,’ she said, noting none were positive. World Aquatics data released days before the Games showed Chinese swimmers in Paris -- including 11 of the 23 embroiled in the doping scandal -- had been tested at least 10 times since the beginning of the year. Including tests conducted by other organisations, Chinese swimmers were tested on average 21 times -- far more than any other nation. It wasn't enough, however, to silence the critics when Pan swam an extraordinary 46.40sec to shatter his own 100m freestyle world record. The 19-year-old, who was not among the 23 swimmers in the report, called it a ‘magic moment’ and Australian silver medallist Kyle Chalmers said he was confident the race was clean. But the manner of the win sparked an angry response from Australian Olympian-turned swimming coach Brett Hawke, who mentored Brazil's Cesar Cielo -- the first man to break 47 seconds. ‘I've studied speed. I understand it. I'm an expert in it, that's what I do,’ he said on Instagram. ‘You don't beat those guys by one full body length in 100 freestyle. That's not humanly possible.’ Other Chinese on podium included Xu Jiayu with silver in the men's 100m backstroke while Wang Shun earned bronze in the 200m medley behind French hero Leon Marchand. Tang Qianting collected silver in the women's 100m breaststroke. Britain's three-time Olympic champion Adam Peaty found China's gold medal-winning success in the 4x100m medley hard to believe, saying on Sunday ‘there's no point winning if you're not winning fair’. Yet Peaty aimed his criticism at the anti-doping authorities: ‘To the people that need to do their job -- wake up and do your job.’ There were some Chinese misses, notably Qin Haiyang who swept all three breaststroke titles at the 2023 world championships and broke the 200m world record. Qin, reportedly among the 23, wilted in the pressure-cooker atmosphere, fading to seventh in the 100m final and failing to even make the 200m final. In China, their performance was praised by most internet users and state-controlled media. But fans were angry over the number of tests they were forced to take, sometimes early in the morning which they suggested had an effect on their performances. ‘Chinese sportsmen and women have not been given fair conditions’, said one, in comments that reflected the general tone of reaction. Official media blasted the continued suspicion hanging over the team, despite being cleared by WADA. ‘The Chinese swimming team has been denigrated by part of the Western media, under the impetus of the United States,’ the China Daily newspaper said. ‘This has seriously disrupted the team's training sessions and races.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/others/241721/china-shrug-off-doping-controversy-to-win-12-swimming-medals
"Bangladesh’s iron lady Sheikh Hasina falls after 15yrs in power, flees to India","Prime minister Sheikh Hasina resigned on Monday and fled the country, ending her 15-year rule amid an unprecedented student-led mass uprising against her authoritarian regime. She left her Ganabhaban official residence by a military helicopter with her sister Sheikh Rehana before the army chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, confirmed her resignation at a press conference in front of his Dhaka cantonment office. Thousands of people stormed to the prime minister’s Ganabhaban residence in jubilation soon after she left and some climbed atop a statue of the country’s founding president, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. She reached India, where Hasina and her family were sheltered, Indian daily The Hindu reported hours after the ousted Bangladesh ruler fled the country. Before confirming Hasina’s resignation, Waker-Uz-Zaman said that he had invited representatives of different political parties and discussed with them the formation of an interim government. ‘We had a nice discussion. I think this discussion would be fruitful. And we will run the country through forming an interim government,’ said Waker-Uz-Zaman, adding that they would go to president Md Shahabuddin Chuppu to discuss the formation of the new government. Waker-Uz-Zaman confirmed that representatives of all major parties, except the Awami League, were present at the meeting. He assured all of arranging trials for all killings and injustices and said that he would take responsibility for saving people’s lives and properties. ‘Do not lose your hope. The many demands that you have we will fulfil that and will restore peace and discipline in the country,’ he said, urging all to refrain from vandalism, killing, and clashes. At noon, Inter-Services Public Relations announced that the army chief would address the nation, asking protesters to keep their patience until then. As street barriers were removed in Dhaka, thousands of protesters rushed to Shahbagh Square in anticipation of Hasnina’s fall. Waker was supposed to address the nation at 2:00pm but later it was deferred to 3:00pm. He finally skipped the address and instead held a press conference, which triggered wild jubilation among the protesters and opposition supporters. Following the resignation of Hasina, who was labelled as a fascist and dictator by protestors, hundreds of thousands of people also entered the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban. The mob set fire to different entities, including AL offices, police stations, and media houses, following Hasina’s fall. After forming a government in January 2009, Hasina, until Monday, ignored all local and international criticisms against her misrules, including serious violations of human rights, snatching of freedom of expression, enacting various draconian laws, massive corruption, destroying of all democratic institutions, and ruination of the electoral system. She ignored all political demands for fair elections and was elected in the 2014 general election, with 153 lawmakers winning unopposed amid a boycott of all opposition parties. Ballot boxes were filled up well before voting in the 2014 general election, and her latest parliament was formed in 2024 in a one-sided general election that was levelled as a dummy election. At the latest, her government carried out a massive crackdown on students and other protestors when the Student Movement Against Discrimination, a platform of anti-quota protestors, demanded reform of the quota system in public service. Around 350 people were killed in the July massacre against protesting students and ordinary people that started with the Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of the then-ruling Awami League of Sheikh Hasina, carrying out an attack on agitators on July 15. The attack added fuel to the student protests, which turned into civil unrest due to the mass killings and mass arrests of agitators. Students presented nine-point demands, including an unconditional public apology from Sheikh Hasina by accepting responsibility for the killing of more than 200 people in violent clashes between July 16 and July 21 and their aftermath. Students also sought the removal of her home minister, law minister, road transport and bridges minister, and education minister, assurance of justice for the killing of students; freeing all arrested students; and withdrawal of false cases against them. Without addressing the demands, the authority picked up and detained six key coordinators of the student movement unlawfully between four and six days at the detective branch of Dhaka Metropolitan Police. The six coordinators—Nahid Islam, Sarjis Alam, Hasnat Abdullah, Asif Mahmud, Nusrat Tabassum, and Abu Baker Mojumder—observed a 32-hour hunger strike at the DB office before they were freed amid growing local and international criticism. Later, at a mass rally at the Central Shaheed Minar on Friday, they announced a one-point demand for Sheikh Haisna’s resignation, as their nine-point demands were not addressed.  People flood the Shahbagh crossing in the capital on Monday to celebrate the resignation of Sheikh Hasina as prime minister and her fleeing from the country. — Sony Ramany",https://www.newagebd.net/post/Politics/241720/bangladeshs-iron-lady-sheikh-hasina-falls-after-15yrs-in-power-flees-to-india

"Bangladesh PM resigns and leaves Dhaka, thousands enter Ganabhaban","Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled her palace on Monday, a source told AFP, as masses of protesters demanding her resignation roamed the streets of Dhaka and the army chief was set to address the nation. Jubilant looking crowds waved flags, peacefully celebrating including some dancing on top of a tank, as a source close to the embattled leader said she had left her palace in the capital for a ‘safer place’. Bangladeshi television channels reported that the PM had resigned and left Dhaka. Hasina’s son urged the country’s security forces to block any takeover from her rule, while a senior advisor told AFP that her resignation was a ‘possibility’ after being questioned as to whether she would quit. ‘She wanted to record a speech, but she could not get an opportunity to do that,’ the source close to Hasina told AFP. Meanwhile, thousands of protesters stormed the palace of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in Dhaka Monday after a source told AFP she had fled mass demonstrations demanding she quit. Bangladesh’s army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman will address the nation on Monday afternoon, a military spokesman told AFP without giving further details. Waker told officers on Saturday that the military ‘always stood by the people’, according to an official statement. The military declared an emergency in January 2007 after widespread political unrest and installed a military-backed caretaker government for two years. ‘Uphold the constitution’ Rallies that began last month against civil service job quotas have escalated into some of the worst unrest of Hasina’s 15-year rule and shifted into wider calls for the 76-year-old to leave. ‘Your duty is to keep our people safe and our country safe and to uphold the constitution,’ her son, US-based Sajeeb Wazed Joy, said in a post on Facebook. ‘It means don’t allow any unelected government to come in power for one minute, it is your duty.’ But protesters on Monday defied security forces enforcing a curfew, marching on the capital’s streets after the deadliest day of unrest since demonstrations erupted last month. Internet access was tightly restricted on Monday, offices were closed and more than 3,500 factories servicing Bangladesh’s economically vital garment industry were shut. Soldiers and police with armoured vehicles in Dhaka had barricaded routes to Hasina’s office with barbed wire, AFP reporters said, but vast crowds flooded the streets, tearing down barriers. The Business Standard newspaper estimated as many as 400,000 protesters were on the streets but it was impossible to verify the figure. ‘The time has come for the final protest,’ said Asif Mahmud, one of the key leaders in the nationwide civil disobedience campaign. ‘Shocking violence’ At least 94 people were killed on Sunday, including 14 police officers. Protesters and government supporters countrywide battled each other with sticks and knives, and security forces opened fire. The day’s violence took the total number of people killed since protests began in early July to at least 300, according to an AFP tally based on police, government officials and doctors at hospitals. ‘The shocking violence in Bangladesh must stop,’ United Nations rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement. ‘This is an unprecedented popular uprising by all measures,’ said Ali Riaz, an Illinois State University politics professor and expert on Bangladesh. ‘Also, the ferocity of the state actors and regime loyalists is unmatched in history.’ Protesters in Dhaka on Sunday were seen climbing a statue of Hasina’s father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s independence leader, and smashing it with hammers, according to videos on social media verified by AFP. ‘Walls are closing in’ In several cases, soldiers and police did not intervene to stem Sunday’s protests, unlike during the past month of rallies that repeatedly ended in deadly crackdowns. ‘Let’s be clear: The walls are closing in on Hasina: She’s rapidly losing support and legitimacy,’ Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center, told AFP. ‘The protests have taken on immense momentum, fuelled by raw anger but also by the confidence that comes with knowing that so much of the nation is behind them,’ he said. In a hugely symbolic rebuke of Hasina, a respected former army chief demanded the government ‘immediately’ withdraw troops and allow protests. ‘Those who are responsible for pushing people of this country to a state of such an extreme misery will have to be brought to justice,’ ex-army chief General Ikbal Karim Bhuiyan told reporters Sunday. The anti-government movement has attracted people from across society in the South Asian nation of about 170 million people, including film stars, musicians and singers. Hasina has ruled Bangladesh since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition. Her government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including through the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists. Demonstrations began over the reintroduction of a quota scheme that reserved more than half of all government jobs for certain groups. The protests have escalated despite the scheme having been scaled back by Bangladesh’s top court.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/Country/241717/bangladesh-pm-resigns-and-leaves-dhaka-thousands-enter-ganabhaban

Internet services return to normalcy,"After nearly 27 hours of shutdown mobile internet network was restored and social media platforms were accessible about 3:00pm on Monday, following the ouster of the Sheikh Hasina-led government through student protests. Also the broadband internet connection was restored about the same time after nearly four hours of blackout from about 11:00am on Monday. Users across the country reported that they were able to access the social media platforms, including Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp, from about 3:00pm on the day. Internet Service Providers Association of Bangladesh president Emdadul Haque told New Age that they did not get bandwidth from the International Internet Gateway companies for several hours from about 11:00am on Monday. ‘We hope that internet connections will run at a normal speed within tonight, as it takes some time for internet services to return to normal if cache servers get shut down,’ he said. A cache server is a type of network service that saves internet content and web pages locally. Mobile internet services were shut down at about noon on Sunday during the countrywide student protests pressing for resignation of the Sheikh Hasina-led government. Telecom operators Grameenphone and Robi Axiata on Sunday said that they received the government order to shut down mobile internet services on the day. Earlier on August 2, some social media platforms, including Facebook, Messenger and Telegram, were down for about seven hours. Later on, Grameenphone and Banglalink in a media statement said that the authorities ordered them to do so. Robi Axiata declined to comment while Teletalk said that they did not get any such order. The government shut down the internet connection, both mobile and broadband, across the country on July 18 amid countrywide quota reform protests, and restored the services partially on July 23. The broadband connection was restored countrywide on July 24 and mobile internet was restored on July 28. Users, however, were denied access to the social media platforms until the government unblocked them on July 31.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/Country/241715/internet-services-return-to-normalcy
Bangladesh anti-PM protesters defy curfew after deadly clashes,"Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi protesters demanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s resignation defied security forces enforcing a curfew on Monday, marching on the capital’s streets after the deadliest day of unrest since demonstrations erupted last month.

Air in Dhaka in moderate’ zone,"Dhaka has ranked 26th on the list of cities with the worst air quality with an AQI score of 70 at 10:00am Monday morning. Today’s air was classified as ‘moderate’, according to the AQI index. When the AQI value for particle pollution is between 50 and 100, air quality is considered ‘moderate’, usually sensitive individuals should consider limiting prolonged outdoor exertion, between 101 and 150, air quality is considered ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’, between 150 and 200 is ‘unhealthy’, between 201 and 300 is said to be ‘very unhealthy’, while a reading of 301+ is considered ‘hazardous’, posing serious health risks to residents. Pakistan’s Lahore, Indonesia’s Jakarta and Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Kinshasa occupied the first, second and third spots in the list, with AQI scores of 153, 145 and 114, respectively. The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. The AQI in Bangladesh is based on five pollutants: particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon.

He said scores more protesters were killed over the weekend. At least 13 police officers were also killed when a police station was attacked in Sirajganj district, he mentioned. With a mass march on Dhaka planned for today, Turk said he is deeply worried that there will be further loss of life and wider destruction. ‘I appeal urgently to the political leadership and to the security forces to abide by their obligations to protect the right to life, and the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression,’ he said. In his statement, the UN Human Rights Chief said ‘accountability’ for human rights violations – including for those with superior and command responsibility – is crucial. The international community must make it clear that at this pivotal time, there will be no impunity, he said. ‘The government must cease targeting those participating peacefully in the protest movement, immediately release those arbitrarily detained, restore full Internet access, and create conditions for meaningful dialogue,’ Turk said. The continuing effort to ‘suppress popular discontent, including through the excessive use of force, and the deliberate spread of misinformation and incitement to violence’ must immediately cease, he added. Turk did not mention the killing of ruling party men and vandalism and arson carried out targeting residence of ministers, MPs, and party offices. Another policeman was killed in Cumilla, which he did not mention in his statement.

Protesters urge int’l communities to stand by common people of Bangladesh,"In a statement sent out by Abdul Kader, a coordinator of Student Movements Against Discrimination, a platform for protesting students, on early Monday, urged the international community to stand by the common people of Bangladesh and create international pressure to oust this government before the ongoing series of massacres takes the form of genocide. They called upon the free world, the United Nations and in fact the world as a whole to immediately support their one-point demand — the resignation of Sheikh Hasina. The statement read, ‘We the students are not fighting for power. We just want to establish a democratic state system where everyone can grow up with equal opportunities and rights for our generation and the future generations. We are ready to give our lives for this.’ They also urged the people from all walks of life to join their Monday’s March to Dhaka programme. The statement reads, ‘…Your next destination is Dhaka. Starting now, I urge all of you to head towards Dhaka. All of us will protest in Dhaka on Monday.’ ‘The government issued a curfew for an indefinite period from 6:00pm on Sunday unconstitutionally violating fundamental rights of the people to save itself.’ Abdul Kader, on behalf of the coordinators and protesters, urged people to reject the curfew and join their Monday’s progeamme. ‘If Sheikh Hasina’s forces fire at us, we will be forced to peacefully march towards Ganabhaban to bring down the government,’ the statement reads.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/Country/241711/protesters-urge-intl-communities-to-stand-by-common-people-of-bangladesh

Scheffler basks in national pride after triumph,"Scottie Scheffler said he felt ‘proud to be an American’ after a dramatic triumph in the final round of the men's golf event to win Olympic gold on Sunday. The world number one was four shots off the lead heading into the last day, but fired a course record-equalling nine-under-par 62 to clinch the title by a single stroke. Scheffler followed in the footsteps of compatriot Xander Schauffele, who fell away after starting Sunday tied for the lead, by winning the gold medal. ‘I'm proud to be American,’ said the 28-year-old, who was holding back tears on the podium. ‘I got emotional the other night watching the gold medal ceremony for the women's gymnastics. I take tremendous pride in coming over here and representing my country. ‘It was just very emotional being up there on stage there as the flag is being raised and sitting there singing the national anthem.’ Scheffler's win in Paris was his seventh title of a remarkable season in which he has already sealed his second Masters green jacket and second Players Championship trophy. His dominance was briefly threatened when he was arrested at the PGA Championship in May before charges were dropped, but he quickly bounced back with victories at the prestigious Memorial Tournament and the Travelers Championship the following month. Scheffler is widely regarded as a cool customer, but says emotions often get the better of him after a win. ‘Typically I'm fairly emotional as it is. I think with this tournament, there wasn't much time in between winning, and then you kind of just get ushered through everything,’ he said of having little time to himself before the medal presentation. ‘I remember after the Masters this year, I took a bathroom break but really I just wanted to be by myself for a minute. I cried pretty good after that one.’ Scheffler started quickly with three successive birdies, including a chip-in on the second hole, to close the gap on overnight leaders Schauffele and Jon Rahm. The birdies dried up and a missed six-foot putt on the par-five ninth was his sixth straight par. But Rahm, who was four shots clear after 10 holes, started to falter and Scheffler was ruthless, romping home with a six-under back nine of 29. ‘I felt like at the time it was definitely slipping away,’ Scheffler said of his miss on the ninth. ‘It can feel pretty frustrating at times to feel like you're doing the right things and not getting anything out of it.’ Britain's Tommy Fleetwood was tied for the lead with Scheffler before a bogey on the 17th. He had to hole out from off the green for birdie on the final hole to force a play-off for gold. After his chip did not drop, Fleetwood holed a nervy six-foot putt to clinch the silver medal ahead of Hideki Matsuyama who took home bronze for Japan. ‘I was obviously trying to catch Scottie and finish in front of him,’ said Fleetwood. ‘Once that chip had missed, I had to sort of turn my attention to try and make sure I hole the next putt as well. ‘I've certainly loved that back nine. Well, the whole of today but the back nine, in contention, playing very, very well. The leaderboard changed quite a bit, and it was amazing to be a part of.’ ",https://www.newagebd.net/post/golf/241709/scheffler-basks-in-national-pride-after-triumph
Taiwanese boxer in gender row wins to guarantee medal,"Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting became the second fighter at the centre of a Paris Olympics gender row to guarantee herself a medal after convincingly winning her quarter-final on Sunday. Lin, who together with Algerian boxer Imane Khelif is at the centre of a storm over their eligibility, defeated Bulgaria's Svetlana Staneva on a unanimous points decision to reach the semi-finals of the women's 57kg category. With her second win of the tournament, the 28-year-old Lin is certain to win a medal because losing semi-finalists in the boxing take home bronze. After a scrappy and tetchy fight, the 34-year-old Staneva made an X sign with her fingers to the crowd and, clearly angry, declined to speak to reporters. But her coach Borislav Georgiev held a piece of paper with the words: ‘I'm XX. Save woman sport.’ In most cases, males have both an X and Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. Khelif, who boxes again on Tuesday, is also guaranteed at least bronze after winning her quarter-final in the women's 66kg division. Khelif and Lin were disqualified from last year's world championships after failing gender eligibility tests, but were cleared to box in the French capital. They also competed at the Tokyo Games in 2021 but did not win medals. Neither boxer is known to identify as transgender and the exact nature of the test they failed previously is unclear. After Staneva's defeat, Bulgarian president Rumen Radev weighed into the debate, sending congratulations for her ‘fighting spirit’. ‘She had the courage to fight not only for victory... but also to defend normality and the Olympic principles in sport,’ he wrote on Facebook. Lin will face Turkey's Esra Yildiz Kahraman on Wednesday in the semi-finals. The Taiwanese said she appreciated the support from people back home, where she has had the public backing of the government and fans. ‘I just know that everyone is cheering for me and I know that all the people in Taiwan are behind me and support me,’ she said. The controversy ignited on Thursday when Khelif needed just 46 seconds to win her opening bout in the French capital, forcing an abandonment against her hurt and tearful Italian opponent Angela Carini. Carini, who suffered a badly hurt nose and was distressed, collapsed to the centre of the ring in tears. Lin and the 25-year-old Khelif were disqualified from the 2023 world championships, run by the International Boxing Association. The IBA said this week that the two boxers ‘did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognised test, whereby the specifics remain confidential’. The boxing in Paris is organised by the International Olympic Committee, which took over because of governance, financial and ethical issues at the IBA. The IOC has leapt to the defence of Khelif and Lin, with president Thomas Bach on Saturday saying they were born and raised as women, and have passports saying that.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/others/241708/taiwanese-boxer-in-gender-row-wins-to-guarantee-medal

Algerian teen Nemour makes history with uneven bars gold,"Algerian teenager Kaylia Nemour conjured up ‘the performance of her life’ to become the first African to win an Olympic gymnastics medal with gold on the uneven bars on Sunday. The 17-year-old French-born athlete took the title ahead of China's Qiu Qiyuan, who took the world title ahead of the Algerian last year, with American Sunisa Lee snatching bronze. Defending champion Nina Derwael of Belgium finished fourth. ‘I'm so shocked, it's the dream of all my life. I can't believe it has happened, I'm the Olympic champion. I'm speechless,’ said Nemour. ‘It was my ultimate dream, years of hard work, details. I'm honoured to have been able to win this medal, first of all for me and for Algeria too.’ Nemour's stunning high-flying acrobatic performance earned a career-best 15.700 points to push Qiu, also 17, into the silver medal position with 15.500. ‘In qualifying I had 15.600, when I saw her 15.500 I said, I really had to fight and gave the performance of my life,’ said the Algerian. ‘It's crazy, I'm honoured to have this medal after all that has happened, it's a relief.’ Nemour switched to represent her father's country two years ago, after the French federation blocked her from competing after a medical dispute. A growth spurt of 14 centimetres (5.5 inches) in a year just after she turned 13 caused a bone problem which required surgery on both knees. After a legal battle lasting several months Nemour was excluded from the France team and switched to competing for Algeria at worlds last October, and the Olympic Games in Paris. ‘I am very happy to have won this medal for Algeria. I hope I made them proud,’ she said. ‘It has been an intensive road. But right now I am glad I performed well and have the gold.’ Nemour was the favourite in the absence of US gymnastics great Simone Biles who failed to qualify for the uneven bars final. But competing last, teammate Lee grabbed bronze ahead of Derwael, a former two-time world champion who was returning after surgery. ‘Having seen the others doing so well kind of put the pressure on me to do a good routine,’ said Lee, 21. ‘That's exactly what I did.’ Her routine earned 14.800 points and her third medal in Paris after team gold and bronze in the all-around. For Qui there were ‘regrets’ at missing out on gold. ‘(Kaylia) did amazing today,’ she said.  ‘All the movements were so smooth. Her routine was perfect. She did even better than her previous routines.’ ",https://www.newagebd.net/post/others/241705/algerian-teen-nemour-makes-history-with-uneven-bars-gold
Lyles wins Olympic 100m gold in closest finish in modern history,"World champion Noah Lyles roared to victory in 9.79sec to claim gold in a dramatic men's Olympic 100m final in Paris on Sunday. Lyles won in the closest Olympic 100m finish in modern history -- just five thousandths of a second separated him from Jamaica's Kishane Thompson who clocked the same time of 9.79sec. It made Lyles the first American, male or female, to win the event since Justin Gatlin took gold in the 2004 Athens Games. ‘It's the one I wanted,’ said Lyles. ‘It's the hard battle, it's the amazing opponents. ‘Everybody's healthy, everybody came prepared for the fight and I wanted to prove that I'm the man amongst all of them. I'm the wolf amongst wolves.’ Lyles' victory was only confirmed after a photo-finish. The American said of the wait for the final results: ‘I went up to Kishane and I was like, 'I'm going to be honest, bro, I think you had that one'. ‘And I was fully prepared to see his name pop up and to see my name pop up, I'm like goodness gracious. I'm incredible.’ Lyles' US teammate Fred Kerley took bronze in 9.81sec, just one-hundredth ahead of South African Akani Simbine, who timed 9.82sec. In an astonishing race, defending champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy was fifth in 9.85sec, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo sixth in 9.86sec, American Kenny Bednarek seventh in 9.88sec and Jamaican Oblique Seville eighth in 9.91sec. Starting in lane seven, outside Seville and inside Tebogo, Lyles got off to an average start but was soon into his stride pattern. Head tucked down through to the 40-metre mark, the American opened up, but the whole field pushed him all the way. As Lyles dipped for the line with Thompson charging alongside him, the crowd erupted and a photo-finish was called before Lyles was confirmed as gold medallist. There was an electric pre-race atmosphere in a 69,000-capacity Stade de France, a light show and booming music keeping the crowd entertained as the sprinters made the final adjustments to their starting blocks.The lights were then shut off, the sprinters leaving the track to remake their entrance like prize fighters in a colosseum. Each sprinter was individually introduced behind an image of their name above their flag. Thompson roared, hands clenched in fists as his head rolled back. Kerley patted his heart. Lyles bounded out like a kangaroo, bouncing 20 metres down the track. Jacobs was the definition of cool, raising both arms and calmly walking to his blocks. Then came the moment where the sprinters set, at the starter’s beck and call. The wait seemed interminable. The music continued, the crowd clapped in unison as if to hurry the starter, then the sprinters stood in their lanes, rocking from foot to foot and the tension was palpable. The cameras panned one more and then it was time, the only sound that of a helicopter's wings whirring overhead. The shot was fired and the field moved as if one up the purple track. The photo-finish officials examined the evidence and Lyles walked away with gold to bury the demons of the Tokyo Olympics three years ago where he harvested a mere 200m bronze. Asked whether he was confident of doubling up in the 200m, an event in which he is a three-time world champion, Lyles was in no doubt. ‘100 percent,’ he said. ‘That's my better event and now that I've got a new PR in the 100, I'm ready to take it to the 200.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/Others/241704/lyles-wins-olympic-100m-gold-in-closest-finish-in-modern-history
Sleepless in Paris: Yulo defies tiredness to win second gold,"Carlos Yulo shrugged off a sleepless night to win gymnastics gold in the men's vault at the Paris Olympics on Sunday, 24 hours after claiming the floor title for a piece of Philippines sporting history. ‘It's crazy because last night I couldn't sleep. I was so hyped because I had won that gold medal on floor,’ the 24-year-old Yulo said. ‘It still didn't sink in. This morning I was so sleepy, I didn't know what to do.’ Armenia's Artur Davtyan took silver with Britain's Harry Hepworth just denying his compatriot and vault world champion Jake Jarman for the bronze. Prior to Yulo's heroics in Paris, the Philippines had only ever won one gold medal at the Olympics. He singlehandedly tripled that tally over one weekend with two stunning performances. ‘I was just hoping to perform well (today). I didn't really expect a medal. It really felt like a bonus for me,’ he smiled, adding that he had grabbed some shut eye whenever he got the chance before the final. ‘I slept in the bus, I slept after the podium training. I slept before going to the competition area. I kind of was napping for 15 to 20 minutes. I felt good after that and I just went for it.’ On the crest of a wave after Saturday's floor title, Yulo leapt to the top of the leaderboard at the midway stage of the eight-man vault final. His average from his two vaults gave him a score of 15.116. Davtyan went last and nailed silver ahead of Olympic debutant Hepworth, whose bronze was Britain's first Olympic medal in the men's vault. Yulo, who prevailed by 0.150 points, punched the air after executing a superb piked double front half-out move with only a small hop on landing that helped lift him to the top of the podium for the second time in a day. Davtyan was left with a bitter-sweet taste after going so close to gold. ‘I am a little bit disappointed because I wanted the gold medal. But I have the silver, I'm glad for that’ he said. Hepworth meanwhile disclosed he was planning an extravagant evening's entertainment to mark his bronze. ‘I will have a full pizza in the Olympic Village. That's how I will celebrate’ he laughed. Honourable mention must go to Mahdi Olfati, representing Iran in the men's vault final for the first time in 60 years, and who finished last but one.

Birthday boy Pan leads China to men’s 4x100m medley relay gold,"World record-holder Pan Zhanle celebrated his birthday Sunday with a storming final leg to hand China gold in the men's Olympic 4x100m medley relay. The Chinese team of Xu Jiayu, Qin Haiyang, Sun Jiajun and Pan touched in 3min 27.46sec with the United States second in 3:28.01. France came home third in 3:28.38, with superstar Leon Marchand adding a bronze medal to his four golds in Paris. ‘It's magic for me,’ said Pan, who smashed the 100m freestyle world record on his way to the title this week. ‘I think we make a good team and we got a good result. ‘For me, the whole journey of the Olympic Games has been great. I'm very satisfied. I think I can swim even faster,’ he added. Xu, the 100m backstroke silver medallist, gave China the lead after the opening leg, with Qin ensuring they also turned first after the breaststroke. France came surging back, thanks to a sizzling butterfly leg from Maxime Grousset, before Pan swam an incredible 45.92 leg in the freestyle to bring it home for China. ‘I think the expectation is gold,’ said a disappointed Caeleb Dressel, who swam the butterfly for the Americans. ‘That's traditionally what we strive for and I don't think that changes any Olympic cycle. That was a close race, cane down to the wire.’ ",https://www.newagebd.net/post/others/241702/birthday-boy-pan-leads-china-to-mens-4x100m-medley-relay-gold

Long-route communication halted across Bangladesh amid deadly protests,"Long-route communications across Bangladesh remained virtually cut off on Sunday, on the first day of the non-cooperation movement announced by the leaders of the Student Movement against Discrimination, demanding the resignation of the Sheikh Hasina-led government. No long-route buses and trains ran across the country while very few launches and ferries plied on the day. Protesters blocked different highways in different districts on the day. Only a handful of public transports, other vehicles and people were seen on roads in the capital on the day. At least 91 people were killed on Sunday across the country in the wake of violent clashes among protesters, members of law-enforcement agencies and members of ruling party and its associate organisations on the first day of the non-cooperation movement. With Sunday’s deaths, the death toll in the violence during the protests between July 16 and August 4 reached over 300. Since Saturday afternoon no long route buses started for any destination from Dhaka. Mohakhali Bus Terminal Owners Association president Abul Kalam said on Sunday that since Saturday afternoon no long route buses from Mohakhali, Gabtoli and Saidabad terminals left Dhaka. ‘The bus owners are not running buses fearing vandalism,’ he said. Kalam, also executive president of the Dhaka Road Transport Owners Association, said that very few city service buses ran on the capital roads on the day. Only a handful of CNG-run auto rickshaws, cars, motorcycles and other vehicles were seen on the Dhaka roads in the morning which also became scarce in the afternoon as clashes had spread across the city. The protesters blocked the Mayor Mohammad Hanif flyover area in Jatrabari from Sunday morning, preventing vehicles from crossing the area to travel on the Dhaka-Chattogram, Dhaka-Narayanganj and Dhaka-Mawa highways. New Age correspondent in Jahangirnagar University reported that the protesting students from the university, nearby colleges and other universities on the day blocked the Dhaka-Aricha highway for about two and a half hours. They sat on the highway from about 11:50am to about 2:30pm and chanted slogans to press home their one-point demand of resignation of the Awami League government. Our correspondent in Manikganj reported that the protesters in the district also blocked the Dhaka-Aricha highway in the morning by setting tyres on fire. New Age correspondent in Narsingdi reported that students gathered at Jail Khana intersection on Dhaka-Sylhet highway in the town at about 1:00pm on the day and blocked the highway till filing of the report at 7:00pm. New Age correspondent in Patuakhali reported that the protesters blocked the Patuakhali-Dhaka highway on Sunday morning. Bangladesh Railway did not run any trains on the day for ‘unavoidable reasons’. Earlier railway resumed services of trains on short distances from August 1 after all train services were halted for 10 days. Very few launches plied on the day, said Bangladesh Inland Water Passenger Carrier Association vice-president Badiuzzaman Badal. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority joint director (Sadarghat terminal) Alamgir Kabir said that on the day till 7:00pm 32 launches arrived and 18 departed from the terminal. Usually, 60 launches on average arrived and 70 left every day, said the joint director. BIWTA deputy general manager (Aricha Ghat) Shah Khaled Newaz said that very few transports arrived for crossing the river on the day. Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport executive director M Kamrul Islam, meanwhile, in a message said that all international and domestic flights from the airport continued uninterrupted and no international flights and domestic flights were cancelled till 8:00pm on the day.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/Country/241699/long-route-communication-halted-across-bangladesh-amid-deadly-protests
TIB for overhauling state structure,"Transparency International Bangladesh on Sunday called for a comprehensive overhaul of the state structure to ensure human rights, justice, and good governance. The organisation made the demand during a series of simultaneous human chains formed in Dhaka and 45 other locations across the country, according to a press release. It emphasised that the ongoing student movement had been subjected to severe and widespread human rights violations, marked by indiscriminate and brutal actions at multiple levels. The organisation cited the misuse of power by law enforcement agencies and state institutions, a lack of good governance, and a system, plagued by corruption and arrogance, as the primary causes of the current crisis. In response, TIB staff and volunteers issued an 11-point demand, insisting that these must be accepted without delay and implemented through a specific and time-bound roadmap. The demands included ensuring accountability for all human rights violations through a nationally and internationally recognised investigation, identification of those responsible for tragic deaths, abuse of power, and the unlawful use of force and holding accountable, revealing a comprehensive list of all deceased and injured individuals, categorized by age and occupation. The organisation condemned the state’s response to the peaceful anti-discrimination student movement, reporting that the movement had been met with imposed violence, leading to the tragic loss of hundreds of lives and a reign of terror over the past two weeks. This violence has included unlawful killings through the use of lethal weapons by law enforcement, arbitrary arrests, illegal detainment, and torture, according to TIB. The organization also highlighted the systematic violation of constitutionally guaranteed rights, including freedom of speech, the right to protest, and freedom of association. It further claimed that false narratives had been used to legitimise these illegal activities, which continue to escalated public concern and mistrust. Independent assessments indicate that over 200 students and ordinary citizens, including children, teenagers, journalists, and other professionals, have been killed by law enforcement agencies. According to TIB, the fatalities resulted from the unlawful and indiscriminate use of power and lethal weapons by law enforcement. At least 2,13,000 individuals have been implicated in more than 200 cases in the police stations of Dhaka alone, with many being detained or abducted despite clear evidence of their lack of involvement in any violence or illegal activities. The organisation also reported that many individuals were being subjected to physical and mental torture during remand, further exacerbating the human rights crisis in the country.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/241698/tib-for-overhauling-state-structure
"Strong actions would be taken against violence, says Arafat","State minister for information and broadcasting Mohammad Ali Arafat reiterated on Sunday that the government sought to resolve the ongoing crisis peacefully through dialogue, while also emphasising that they would take strong action against those who resorted to violence. ‘We want to resolve the crisis peacefully through talks, but at the same time, we want to make it clear that if terrorists engage in violence, the law will be enforced,’ he told reporters during a briefing on Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises. Arafat stressed that the government would target genuine terrorists, not innocent protesters, noting that the student movement had strayed from its original purpose and had turned into an act of terrorism and violence then. ‘Our stance is in favour of peace, dialogue, and holding accountable those responsible for the casualties in the recent violence,’ Arafat said, adding, ‘Many people are shocked by the deaths of several children.’ Highlighting that the entire nation of 17 crore people was mourning the deaths of those children, he stated, ‘We need to investigate these incidents to take legal action against the real culprits.’ Arafat questioned the motives behind those deaths, pointing out that the children were not involved in protests against the government. ‘What harm could these children have caused to the government? And how could the government have benefited from these killings?’ he asked. He urged the public to consider these questions and suggested that miscreants took advantage of these tragic events, using the deaths of children to incite the public and lead them astray. ‘They are now trying to achieve their evil objectives.’ Reaffirming the government’s commitment to bringing the perpetrators to justice, Arafat said, ‘The judicial commission has already begun its work and today [on Sunday] travelled to Rangpur to investigate the incidents.’ The state minister also mentioned that the judicial commission had invited foreign experts to assist with the investigation to ensure complete transparency. He emphasised that only the genuine perpetrators would be brought to justice. ‘We will learn the facts after the investigation, including whether the deaths were caused by anyone within the movement or by police actions,’ he said, adding, ‘The death toll included those who were burnt in fires set by demonstrators.’ Noting the difficulty in identifying those who were burnt, Arafat asked, ‘Will the government be held responsible for these deaths?’ He criticised the demonstrators for attributing the blame to the government before the investigation was completed, suggesting that they did not want the real culprits to be held accountable. He added that their true intentions became clear on Saturday when they announced their one-point demand. Arafat argued that the demonstrators were pursuing their demands through terrorism and violence, pointing to the recent rampage at BSMMU as an example. ‘They, however, were resisted by the general public who were inside the hospital. The people are now uniting against the terrorists. This is the reality,’ he said. The state minister emphasised that all issues could be resolved if a healthy democratic process and discipline prevailed in the country. ‘But you cannot achieve anything through terrorism and violence by creating chaos.’ ‘We have shown great tolerance and are willing to show more. The Awami League and prime minister Sheikh Hasina have numerous supporters, including members of associate bodies,’ Arafat said, adding, ‘If Sheikh Hasina calls upon them, they will take to the streets to resist the terrorists.’ ‘But we keep the door open for dialogue to avoid the path of violence.’ Responding to a question, Arafat said that the protesters revealed their true intentions by aligning with the demands of BNP-Jamaat, adding that the perpetrators had come to the forefront then, exposing the government to the challenge posed on October 28, 2023. As the protesters’ demands align with those of BNP-Jamaat, Arafat concluded, their demonstration now appears to be a political demand of BNP-Jamaat, and ‘we will address it politically’.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/241697/strong-actions-would-be-taken-against-violence-says-arafat
Ex-officers ask army to take back soldiers to barracks,"Retired officers of the armed forces of Bangladesh called upon the government on Sunday to take back the members of the armed forces to barracks. A group of retired officials, ranging from former army chiefs to mid-level officers, came up with the statement at a press conference held at the capital’s RAOWA Club. The officials said that they organised the event to  make their stand clear amid the ongoing situation in the country. They demanded justice for all the recent killings. Former chief of the Bangladesh Army, Iqbal Karim Bhuiyan, read the statement on behalf of the officers. He said that they came up with the statement because they were deeply concerned, troubled, and saddened by all the killings, tortures, disappearances, and mass arrests that had tormented Bangladesh in the past three weeks. ‘The patriotic military must not accept any responsibility for the current situation,’ he said, asking the army to take soldiers to barracks immediately. He asked the army not to destroy the forces’ reputation by engaging them in a ‘disgraceful campaign.’ Iqbal Karim said that they witnessed all these happenings as guardians of students. He noted that Bangladeshi armed forces had never faced masses or been trained to target their guns at the chests of fellow citizens. Iqbal Karim, who served as the chief of army staff from 2012 to 2015, said Bangladesh’s armed forces have worked tirelessly and made many sacrifices towards establishing global peace in the past three decades. He said that the respect, status, and pride that the army earned over the years are being put into question today. He asked the army to stand beside the people of the country, ensuring full adherence to universal human rights. ‘A political crisis was militarised. We, the retired officers, strongly oppose it,’  he said. ‘We cannot let our motherland be destroyed in front of our eyes,’ he added. He also observed that the Bangladesh border remained unprotected at the moment, as members of the Border Guard Bangladesh had been withdrawn in significant numbers to quell the student movement.

Yunus’s firms need to pay Tk 663cr tax: HC,"The High Court on Sunday cleared the way for the National Board of Revenue to claim Tk 663 crore as taxes from Grameen Kalyan, and firms of Nobel laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus, in five income tax assessment years from 2012 to 2017. The bench of Justice Muhammad Khurshid Alam Sarkar and Justice SM Maniruzzaman passed the order after disposing of a writ petition filed in 2017 by Grameen Kalyan’s managing director Abul Kalam Mohammad Mohiuddin Chowdhury challenging the  legality of the assessment with hearing the company’s statement. The court in the verdict asked Grameen Kalyan to pay the outstanding Tk 663 crore in installments. Appearing for Grameen Kalyan, lawyer Abdullah Al Mamun sought deferral of the verdict considering the students’ ongoing violent movement, which turned into a one-point demand for resignation of prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Mamun also refused to pay the dues in question in installments. The court suggested Mamun to appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court if he felt aggrieved by the verdict. Grameen Kalyan’s another lawyer Sarder Jinnat Ali argued that the NBR’s orders for reassessment of income tax from company, was illegal as it submitted its income tax time to time. The NBR demanded fresh income tax from Yunus and his founded social business entities after reopening and re-assessment of the companies’ tax files in 2017. Yunus, also the chair of Grameen Telecom, has been facing more than 170 cases, most of which are related to alleged violation of rights of workers. He was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment by the Third Dhaka Labour Court on January 1 along with his three Grameen Telecom colleagues in a case filed by the Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments on September 9, 2021, for violating labour law by Grameen Telecom Company. Yunus and his colleagues remained on bail pending hearing of their appeal against the sentences.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/241695/yunuss-firms-need-to-pay-tk-663cr-tax-hc
AL reaches end point of patience: Nanak,"Ruling Bangladesh Awami League presidium member Jahangir Kabir Nanak on Sunday urged the party people for resistance, saying that the party had reached the end point of its patience. Nanak made the call while briefing journalists at the Awami League president’s political office in Dhanmondi in the afternoon. His call came up at a time when clashes were taking place all over the country on the first day of the non-cooperation movement called by the Student Movement Against Discrimination, which was pressing for  the resignation of the government of prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Blaming the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and banned Jamaat-e-Islami for the attacks, Nanak said that the anarchy carried out by the BNP-Jamaat extremist groups must be resisted. He also said the movement on the streets with a one-point demand for the government’s resignation was not of the students but rather of the BNP and Jamaat conspirators. The protesters must take responsibility for the resulting situation, the killings and violence, he said, adding that the stability of the country could not be destroyed in the name of a movement.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/Politics/241694/al-reaches-end-point-of-patience-nanak
BNP urges all to make March to Dhaka success,"The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Sunday in a statement urged people along with the party leaders and activists to make the ‘March to Dhaka’ programme of protesting students a success. Fakhrul also urged the prime minister to step down from power immediately following the demands of the students. He said, ‘I am calling on the people of our country and the leaders, supporters and well-wishers of BNP and its organisations to make the ‘March to Dhaka’ programme of the students a success and at the same time to continue the movement in their respective areas.’ Fakhrul also urged all the political parties to support the ongoing mass movement of the students. He alleged that the ruling Awami League planned to gather armed leaders and activists and attack the pro-democracy students. Fakhrul said, ‘Awami League’s terrorists and law enforcement forces opened fire with deadly firearms at various places, including Dhanmondi, Science Laboratory, Mirpur, Uttara and Topkhana Road in Dhaka.’ ‘The entire country has been turned into a battleground by killing, torture and using force to suppress the movement. The government is killing the students by indiscriminate shooting,’ he said. ‘The Awami League terrorists’ carried out attacks on the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University and other establishments in a planned way and blame it on the agitators, the BNP leader alleged. Fakhrul said that the government planned to destroy the victory of the movement by inciting conflicts, but the agitating people would foil that conspiracy and win the victory. ‘On the first day of the non-cooperation movement called by the students, the armed terrorists of the Awami League, Chhatra League, and Jubo League and law enforcement agencies in different parts of the country fired and killed about a hundred people and wounded thousands others with bullets,’ he said. He expressed condolences and wished eternal rest to all the souls of those killed in the violence, saying that the trial of those who killed the students in the ongoing movement must be held. Earlier on the day, Student Movements Against Discrimination announced ‘Long March to Dhaka’ for Monday, urging people from all walks of life to march towards the capital and gather in the streets demanding resignation of the government.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/241693/bnp-urges-all-to-make-march-to-dhaka-success
Talks must go beyond hostage negotiations,"Hamas is open to both a militarised and a diplomatic approach. Taking the group seriously could stop the violence, writesCatherine Charrett AS THE war on Gaza rages unabated, European diplomats must step up and use their experience of multiparty diplomacy. The truth is perhaps an uncomfortable one for many: that a genuinely workable solution to this conflict requires an inclusive approach — one that recognises Hamas’s role in Palestinian sovereignty. The killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political bureau and chief negotiator in Tehran was a clear anti-diplomatic provocation from Israel. This is not the first time Israel uses assassinations to derail truces and ceasefire arrangements. The question is will it be the last? Haniyeh was a central figure in the group’s international diplomacy efforts and was a unifying voice, vital for any discussions around a potential ceasefire. European diplomatic engagement must address Israel’s belligerency. Many European diplomats, like US and Israeli officials, have busied themselves in recent months by calling for the removal of Hamas from power — advocating for a change in Palestinian governance in an aim to exclude Hamas in the eventual rebuilding of Gaza. Yet, history has taught us that any talks which exclude Hamas, are ultimately destined to fail. Efforts to isolate, sanction or remove Hamas have not worked in the past — and they will not work now. Tony Blair, for instance, reflected in 2017: ‘We were wrong to boycott Hamas after its election win.’ The former UK prime minister said that himself, other world leaders and the wider international community should have tried to pull Hamas ‘into a dialogue’ and that they were all ‘wrong to yield to Israeli pressure to impose an immediate boycott of Hamas after the Islamic faction won Palestinian elections in 2006.’ Indeed, excluding Hamas from talks in the past has only functioned to delegitimise and isolate members within the movement who might be more prepared to pursue diplomatic and political solutions – and emboldened the military approach instead. Excluding and financially sanctioning Hamas after it was democratically elected and channelling all funds and recognition to Fatah, the party that did not win, weakened Palestinian governance structures. If Europeans want to remain relevant in diplomacy in the region, they should work from notable developments such as the July 23 Beijing Unity Agreement, they should condemn the assassinations of key Hamas diplomats, such as Haniyeh. Instead, they should recognise that having Hamas as part of the administration promotes wider Palestinian oversight over its practices. European states should develop their own diplomatic corridors with Qatar for example, building off their previous diplomatic successes, and their history of taking risks to advance multiparty diplomacy, such as France voting for the presence of the Palestine Liberation Organisation at the United Nations in the 1970s when the group was still criminalised. One other concrete effort that European diplomats might take for instance is to pressure Israel for the release of Marwan Barghouti, a political prisoner who could help unite Palestinian fractions.  Israel’s ‘spoiler’ approach ANY open dialogue with Hamas and the other factions however must also be matched with a recognition of Israel’s ‘spoiler’ position, that being its failure to commit to any diplomatic resolution to the current war, and its continual invasion in the West Bank over the decades, breaking countless UN resolutions. Diplomacy must be directed towards de-escalation of Israeli and American belligerency, and could include the diplomatic closing of the biggest US military base in the Middle East, Al Udeid Air Base to reflect Qatari indignation at the assassination of Haniyeh and a diplomatic move to limit Israeli access to European Union Horizon funding. While Israel has been involved in negotiations for the release of their hostages, it has otherwise adopted an anti-diplomatic approach and refused to find any diplomatic path to the decolonisation of Palestine more broadly, which much of the international community broadly supports. It has rejected various proposed terms for peace, offered by the US and others, and it has frustrated diplomatic efforts and declared the peace process as a threat to its interests. According to European diplomats, following the victory of Hamas in the 2006 elections, Israeli officials immediately contacted their counterparts in the US and the EU declaring that the only possible response to Hamas’s democratic success should be punishment, boycott and sanctions. In an exclusive interview, one European official told me ‘Basically, the US was carrying with them Israeli Minister Lieberman’s policy of sanctioning Hamas and was pushing this on European officials.’ United in their attempts to spoil the results of the democratic election, Israel and the US committed themselves to a clandestine coup of the newly elected Palestinian government by sending weapons into the Gaza Strip to arm and support one Palestinian faction to destroy another. Israel’s anti-diplomatic position has also seen the use of targeted assassinations and continued escalations despite Hamas’s previous unilateral ceasefires. Over the years Hamas’s concessions, in line with international diplomatic arrangements were met with the mass arrest of Hamas members, the tightening of the siege on Gaza, which included the total ban on the movement of people and continued incursions into the enclave. Israeli security officials openly admitted Hamas had been remarkably effective at enforcing the truce from the Gazan front.  Hamas is capable of diplomacy HAMAS as a political party and a movement has shown that it is interested and capable of pursuing both a militarised and a diplomatic approach – and diplomatic engagement from Europe’s side could encourage one over the other. While Hamas as a movement acts in remarkable unison, there is divergence amongst its leadership in terms of approach. Since its founding, the movement has demonstrated it can follow several courses of action, reliant on military and diplomatic approaches. Their decision to participate in the internationally monitored 2006 Palestinian legislative elections, and to pursue a clearly political approach, was ushered in by key diplomatic figures from within the Hamas movement, such as Ahmed Yousef and Ghazi Hamad. But the rejection of these efforts by the international community, and by Europe in particular, discredited these figures who suggested that engagement with elections and continuing with the ceasefire would bring international recognition. In an interview for my book, Yousef told me: ‘We lost our credibility with our people and we paid a huge price.’ The Hamas movement has clear priorities around which dialogue and diplomacy can be built, such as the importance of representative governance, improving the living standards in Gaza, and establishing clear boundaries within which Palestinian governance can be practised. These were confirmed by the creation of a unity government after the 2006 Palestinian elections, in which Hamas relinquished domestic power and gave up six of its nineteen ministries to Fatah and another four to independents, including key positions of interior, finance and foreign ministries, in order to improve governance and representation and to lift the blockade. The movement has also offered a landmark acceptance of the 1967 borders, which many argued amounted to de facto recognition of the state of Israel. However, once again, Hamas’s diplomatic efforts here were rejected through the imposition of a series of conditions that even senior EU officials stated were non-operationable as they failed to measure or monitor Hamas’s compromises on the conditions. The European-supported siege on Gaza meant Hamas’s course of action had to change. Hamas’s Ghazi Hamad said: ‘The international community put us in this cage, in the prison and they refuse to let us see the light from the sun. So our priorities completely changed and they diverted to how to make people survive here. To prevent starvation.’ Hamas has done everything the west and Europe expected from them (and the requirements of the Oslo agreement) including elections, de facto recognition of the state of Israel and abiding by the ceasefire – and yet, still they have not only been ignored, but they have been sanctioned and punished despite, even for choosing diplomacy over an armed approach. At this dire moment, Europeans should seize the initiative to formulate an approach towards anticolonial diplomacy. Such an approach can only be developed by listening to the colonised and recognising their will to represent and govern themselves, just as colonised people everywhere have demanded autonomy and self-determination. European diplomats’ talks with Hamas must go beyond hostage negotiations Hamas is open to both a militarised and a diplomatic approach.

Celebrating walking,"YEARS ago, while attending the Asian Development Bank’s Transport Forum, a group of us went on a walking tour. At one point the sidewalk was so narrow pedestrians were in single file, queued up to wait to walk. In the midst of the noise and chaos, someone was burning trash on the sidewalk. The situation was so dismal I started cheering; this is worse than Dhaka! The irony of walking is that it is so utterly ordinary, dare I say, pedestrian, that we take it for granted. It’s not something we pause to think about or celebrate. We all walk every day without thinking about it. And too many of those out walking in parks and fields are doing so only upon doctor’s orders. Yet walking connects us to our surroundings. On foot (or in a wheelchair), we see what is around us and can easily interact with others. The moment a toddler takes her first stumbling steps are an occasion of great joy. Despite all this, we hear that people in Dhaka are lazy; they do not want to walk. Some people blame rickshaws for people’s lack of interest in walking. Why expend effort when someone else can do so on your behalf? In fact, many people are walking; they are just invisible to policymakers and planners who seem only to notice and plan for the movement of the automobile. As for people’s reluctance to walk, let’s consider how inviting the walking environment is. Do pedestrians have smooth and level footpaths unobstructed with construction waste, parked vehicles, and shop goods? Is crossing the street easy, safe, and convenient? Do people on foot feel valued for moving around without creating pollution or danger? In Bangladeshi newspapers, I regularly see comments about the ‘haphazard movement of pedestrians’ making it difficult for drivers. Pesky pedestrians often walk in the street (usually because the footpath is blocked or non-existent). They ‘leap out’ in front of cars (in other words, attempt to cross the street at the risk of their lives). They “refuse” to use foot bridges (reject being penalised by having to go out of their way and climb a couple flights of stairs just to cross the street). Blaming pedestrians for their own road deaths is outrageous. Of course, victim blaming is something we are all used to; what woman does not know that if she is harassed or raped, it is her fault? Heaven forbid we should blame those with power (men, car drivers) for the damage they cause! When large, heavy, noisy, polluting, dangerous vehicles wreak havoc on our roads, we naturally blame those who are killed. But these tendencies are not universal. Other cities in the world create safe and attractive walking environments, giving pedestrians priority over cars. People out walking are so important, we even get our own day: August 17 is World Pedestrian Day. You may never have heard of it, but it was started by the World Health Organisation to commemorate a woman killed by a car on that date back in 1897. World Pedestrian Day reminds us that walking is a universal right. It reminds us that pedestrian deaths mean the loss of a valued life and a shattered family. It reminds us that speed is deadly, and the best way to reduce road crashes is to lower and strictly enforce speed limits. (Well, that and get rid of cars in cities, but that is a little more difficult.) During the worst of the Covid epidemic, many cities reclaimed street space from motorised vehicles to give people safe places to walk outdoors. Those transformations were much loved and should become permanent. It is more important for people to be physically active and interact outdoors in their community than to facilitate the never-ending demand for road and parking space for vehicles. Streets in Bangladeshi cities send out a clear message of who has value and whose life does not matter. Young and able-bodied people struggle to move about safely; those with disabilities or reduced mobility often face insurmountable obstacles or horrific danger. Do we really believe that the elderly, small children, pregnant women, and people with disabilities are not important members of society? Or only have value when they are using a motorised vehicle? People on foot deserve safe, accessible, and attractive walking networks so that we can move about without creating pollution, without being a danger to others, and while improving our health and the conviviality of our communities. More people out walking in pleasant environments means less diabetes, depression, anxiety, and heart disease. Let’s stop taking walking for granted and fight for better conditions for moving about on foot.

Rising food insecurity shows hollowness of development,"The World Bank food security update that has put Bangladesh in the red zone for a year until May 2024 suggests the worsening food insecurity in Bangladesh. The update says that persistent high food inflation has pushed the large majority of low- and fixed-income people into food insecurity. Bangladesh is placed in the red zone with 18 other countries, where food inflation ranged between 5 per cent and 30 per cent. In Bangladesh, food inflation, keeping to the conservative Bureau of Statistics figure, has remained over 10 per cent for a year. Independent studies, however, estimate food inflation rate double the official figure. Even the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies estimated food inflation in May at 15 per cent while the official figure put it at 10.76 per cent. A South Asian Network on Economic Modelling survey report in March said that moderate and severe food insecurity had increased sharply in two years. The report, which focused on the impact of inflationary pressure on households in April 2023–November 2023, said that high food inflation had led 70 per cent of the households to change their food habit involuntarily. The Food Security Statistics 2023 of the Bureau of Statistics also showed a dismal food security situation. The survey said that 22 per cent of the population experienced moderate to severe food insecurity in 2023. The highest prevalence of food insecure people, 26.13 per cent, was found among families involved in farming. High inflation, slow economic growth and dearth of work have, meanwhile, triggered a reverse migration, with more than 14 people per 1,000 having, as official figures show, returned to villages. Economists say that high inflation has continued to erode people’s purchasing power since mid-2021 and that the number of the new poor has continued to rise, with the government having showed a conservative poverty rate. The food insecurity situation is believed to be caused primarily by the erratic nature of food prices on the domestic market, which the government has failed to address. The government took a number of measures to keep the market stable, but the market remained at the hands of manipulators. Besides, the government’s inability to bolster domestic agriculture for increased production, over-reliance on food import, failure to timely import food, inadequate social safety net measures and ineffective monetary policy are reasons for the rising food insecurity. Such a dismal food security situation questions the government’s development rhetoric and shows the hollowness of the development model that the government has pursued over the years. The authorities must, therefore, abandon its rhetoric and ensure an adequate supply of food items by increasing domestic production and facilitating timely food import. The government must also enhance social safety programmes to cover all vulnerable people. The authorities must also enhance their monitoring to ensure a stable market.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/241677/rising-food-insecurity-shows-hollowness-of-development
Govt should take pulse of people and hear their voice,"People from all walks of life have taken to the streets to lend their support for the student protests, which in the beginning of July sought reforms in civil service job reservations but have now been on the streets demanding the resignation of the government. The protests which begun with a single demand came up with fresh demands as the government employed various tactics, including deception and repression, in efforts to contain the protesters. More than two hundred students have, meanwhile, died in attacks by the ruling Awami League fronts and firing by various law enforcement units, primarily the police all over in July since the 16th that month. Several thousand people became wounded. As August began with the emerging demands of the protesters having remained unmet, groups of university and college teachers and professionals joined in. Political parties in the opposition have also thrown their weight behind the young leaders who have come out from the protests that have rolled for more than a month. The protesters have now began an all-out non-cooperation with the government to press home their demand. The resignation of the government, in such a situation, appears to be a way out from the situation the country has plunged in. The Awami League, which presides over the government, on August 4 employed bullies of its fronts, the Chhatra League and the Juba League, to suppress the student protests all over the country in a violent manner. The employment of the bullies of the Awami League fronts, most holding sticks, rods and sharp weapons and many holding firearms, attacked the protests that left a large number of people dead. The situation also results in the loss of and damage to property. All this suggests that the Awami League has stepped on a confrontational course against not only the protesting students but also people of all walks of life. Whilst the Awami League is doing all this, ranking leaders of the government, including some ministers, and of the Awami League keep telling lies, one after another, to compound the situation. The government should have realised that this is merely not something of the ruling political party being pitched against its political contenders in opposition. Thousands of non-partisan students and ordinary people have lent their support for the protests. In such a violent state, if the protests intensified and more people took to the streets lending their support for the protesting students, this would reach a point of no return any time. This would be unwise on part of the government, which should realise that what it is doing is not doing it right. The government should have avoided the path of confrontation much earlier and handled the issues of the protesters with sincerity and in earnestness. The government should, in such a precariously poised situation, stop applying force to quell the protests and, rather, take the pulse of the people, smell the air that hangs heavy and thick with the death of so many people and hear their voice for an urgent course correction.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/241676/govt-should-take-pulse-of-people-and-hear-their-voice
Indefinite curfew slapped as 92 killed in clashes across Bangladesh,"At least 92 people, including 14 police members, demonstrators, and political activists, were killed in clashes amongst protesters, members of law-enforcement agencies, and activists of ruling Awami League-backed organisations across the country on the first day of the students’ all-out non-cooperation programme demanding the resignation of the government. Of the victims, the highest 22 people, including 13 policemen, were killed in Sirajganj districts, 11 in Dhaka, eight each in Feni and Lakshmipur districts, six in Narsingdi, five in Rangpur, four in Magura, three each in Pabna, Munshiganj, Kishoreganj, Sylhet, Sherpur, Bogura, and Cumilla, two in Jaipurhat, and one each in Barishal, Habiganj, Cox’s Bazar, and Bhola. New Age correspondents in Dhaka and different districts confirmed the figure until 9:30pm  by speaking to different district administrations, hospitals, police, and elected local government sources. Police headquarters assistant inspector general of police Enamul Haque Sagar said in a statement that at least 13 policemen were killed in an attack on the Enayetpur police station in Sirajganj. He also said that another policeman was killed in Cumilla district, while many police stations and other offices or camps came under attack in places on the day. Since the morning, protestors have gathered at different important points in almost every district and upazila in the county while the leaders and activists of the ruling Awami League and its associate bodies have come to the streets, many carrying firearms, as part of their pre-announced counter programme. As the AL people remained engaged in confrontation with protesters in many places, the prime minister and president of the AL, Sheikh Hasina, following a meeting of the National Committee on Security Affairs, the highest policy-making authority of national security, at her official Ganabhaban residence, asked the people of the country to curb anarchists with iron hands. ‘No one of those who are now carrying out violence is a student. They are terrorists,’ PM’s assistant press secretary, ABM Sarwer-E-Alam Sarker, said, quoting her as saying. Amid clashes and anarchies, the home ministry announced a curfew for an indefinite period in Dhaka, all divisional cities, district towns, upazila headquarters, city corporation areas, municipalities, and industrial areas, starting at 6:00pm on Sunday. The government earlier imposed a curfew for an indefinite period past midnight on July 19, which was relaxed from time to time.  It was enforced only in selected areas in the past few days. After the clashes on Sunday turned deadly, the government also declared a three-day public holiday across the country starting on Monday. On Sunday, users complained that they had not gotten access to the Meta platforms Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram, mostly on mobile phones, since afternoon. The state minister for information and broadcasting, Mohammad Ali Arafat, told reporters on Sunday that social media platforms were blocked temporarily in the country to prevent rumours from spreading. The government also urged all students and their guardians to return home and stay safe, saying that extremist attacks were taking place in different places across the country. ‘Extremist attacks are taking place in various places. Strict action will be taken against the attackers,’ said a government handout. Sunday’s death toll is the highest on a single day since the protests broke out in mid-July. New Age earlier confirmed at least 67 deaths on July 19, when the students were protesting seeking reform in quotas for government services. With Sunday’s 92 deaths, the death toll stood at 311 in the ongoing student protest that turned violent on July 15 following the attack by the ruling party student wing Bangladesh Chhatra League on protesters. On Sunday, tens of thousands of people from all walks of life, including students, parents, teachers, day labourers, social workers, and other professional bodies, took to the streets in most of the places in Dhaka city, including Shahbagh, Science Laboratory, Jatrabari, Mohakhali, Dhanmondi-27, Mirpur-10, Uttara, Rampura, and Badda. Clashes erupted between the protesters and the supporters of the ruling party in the city areas like Banglamotor, Karwan Bazar, Shahbagh, Science Laboratory, Mirpur, Jatrabri, and Mohamadpur. Many of the supporters of the ruling party were seen carrying sharp weapons, sticks, and firearms in these areas. Ruling party activists were also seen opening fire at Banglamotor, Hatirpool, and Karwan Bazar areas after the evening, despite the government imposing a curfew from 6:00pm. Protesters allegedly threw brickbats at Shahbagh police station at about 6:30pm, prompting the police to lob tear shells and open fire to disperse the protesters, witnesses said. Protesters snatched the bodies of four people from Dhaka Medical College Hospital at around 6:00pm and went to the Central Shaheed Minar with the bodies, and shouted various slogans. DMCH police outpost-in-charge Bacchu Mia confirmed the matter. Dhaka Metropolitan Police Ramna Division additional deputy commissioner Md Aktharul Islam said that several police constables faced minor injuries. ‘We did not open fire but used sound grenades to disperse protesters,’ he said, adding that they also vandalised police vehicles. Some protesters brought out a procession at the Dainik Bangla crossing at about 7:00pm and police opened fire to disperse them. Earlier in the day, BCL allegedly attacked protesters in Shahbagh, triggering a chase and counter-chase, prompting the ruling party activists to take shelter in the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. About 30-35 vehicles, doctors’ cafeterias, and administrative buildings were set on fire by the protesters, said an official of BSSMU. Protesters denied their role in the arson attack on cars in the BSMMU area. New Age correspondents from Chattogram, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Khulna, Barishal, Cumilla, Lakshimipur, Munshiganj, Pabna, Sirajganj, Feni, Rangpur, Mymensingh, Joypurhat, and Bhola reported that protestors continued demonstrations even after curfew hours started. In Sirajganj, deputy commissioner Mir Mohammad Mahbubur Rahman told New Age that six AL activists were killed in Rayganj and three were killed in Sadar upazilas. Hospital officials and police confirmed that 11 people were killed in Dhaka. In Lakshmipur, Lakshmipur Sadar Hospital resident medical officer Arup Paul confirmed the deaths of eight people, while in Feni 250 Bed General Hospital resident medical officer Asif Iqbal confirmed the deaths of eight people in the district. Narsingdi’s Madabdi police officer-in-charge, Kamruzzaman, confirmed the deaths of six people in the upazila, while Rangpur deputy commissioner Mohammad Mobasher Hasan confirmed five deaths in his district. The victims in the district include a local ward councillor and his bodyguard, he said. Magura superintendent of police Mashiuddaula Reza confirmed the four deaths, while Pabna General Hospital assistant director Rafiqul Hasan confirmed the deaths of three people in the hospital. Mohsin Uddin Fakir, Superintendent of Magura 250 bed District Hospital in Magura, confirmed all four died of bullet injuries in the district. Munshiganj General Hospital superintendent Abu Hena Mohammad Jamal confirmed two deaths in the hospital, while Sirajdikhan Upazila Health Complex resident medical officer AKM Taiful Haque confirmed another death. Kishoreganj deputy commissioner Md Abul Kalam Azad confirmed three deaths, while Sylhet’s Golapganj Upazila Health Complex resident medical officer Shahin Ahmed confirmed three deaths, and Sherpur deputy commissioner Abdullah Al-Khayrum confirmed three deaths in the upazila. According to Kishoreganj deputy commissioner Azad, two of the three victims in the district were burned to death when the protesters set fire to the house of a cousin of former Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam. Bogura Shaheed Zia Medical College Hospital deputy director Abdul Wadud confirmed three deaths, while the district’s civil surgeon Mohammad Shafiul Azam confirmed another death. In Cumilla, three deaths were confirmed, respectively, by Debidwar police officer-in-charge Nayan Mia, Highway Police DIG Khairul Alam, and district civil surgeon Nasima Akter. Deputy commissioners and police officers of Barishal, Jaipurhat, Habiganj, Cox’s Bazar, and Bhola confirmed one death each in their respective districts. In the wake of deadly clashes, students on announced a March to Dhaka programme for today. The ‘March to Dhaka’ programme was originally scheduled for Tuesday, but Asif Mamhmud, a coordinator of the protests, said that they had reviewed decision in emergency situation and decided to hold the event on Monday.
