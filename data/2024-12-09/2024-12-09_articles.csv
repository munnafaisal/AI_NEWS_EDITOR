Mehidy blames bowling as Tigers’ winning run ends,"Bangladesh’s 11-match winning streak over the West Indies came to an end on Sunday when they were defeated by five wickets at Warner Park in St Kitts, in what captain Mehidy Hasan Miraz described as ‘a tough day for the bowlers.’ The visitors failed to defend 294 on a pretty good batting wicket as Sherfane Rutherford’s dream run continued in ODIs. The left-hander now has five fifties and one century in just eight innings and five consecutive fifty-plus innings to his name. Mehidy, though, remained hopeful that they would make a comeback and win the series as the two teams face each other in the second ODI at the same venue at 7:30pm Bangladesh Standard time today. ‘We’ll learn from so many things,’ said Mehidy after the first match. ‘We made some mistakes. We’ll just focus on how to get better in the next matches. We have two matches left, so I think we have a good chance.’ Mehidy’s team was in a solid position when the hosts lost two openers in the first 10 overs. Tanzim Hasan trapped Brandon King lbw while Nahid Rana did the same to Evin Lewis. The Caribbean team found themselves in a deeper hole when Keacy Carty was caught at midwicket off Rishad Hossain. Karty added 67 runs with his captain, Shai Hope. Hope and Rutherford then started to build the innings and took all the time. The required rate was climbing up as Bangladesh bowlers kept it tight. But Mehidy and Co failed to make an incision in that phase as Hope and Rutherford raised their tempo. Hope took 60 deliveries to reach his fifty but ended up with 86 off 88. Bangladesh got hope when Hope was caught at deep midwicket off Mehidy, but Rutherford was in his groove by that time. He had 19 in the first 29 and then reached his fifty in 47. The left-hander then unleashed all fire as his last 63 came off in just 33. By the time Rutherford was dismissed after hitting seven fours and eight sixes, the West Indies were just seven runs away from ending the winless run against Bangladesh. Mehidy said that the lack of middle-over wickets cost them. ‘We started really well, especially Nahid, Taskin, and Tanzim Shakib; they bowled really well. But after that we didn’t bowl well in the middle overs; we didn’t get wickets. It can happen on this type of wicket. But still the wicket was looking good, and they played well,’ Mehidy added. Earlier, Bangladesh got to a fighting 294 thanks to fifties from opener Tanzid Hasan (60 off 60), Mehidy (74 off 101), and Mahmudullah (50 off 44). Jaker Ali also made a quickfire 48 off 40. After making a breezy start, Bangladesh lost opener Soumya Sarker and Liton Das in quick succession. Mehidy then added two fifty-partnerships with Tanzid and Afif Hossain before Mahmudullah and Jaker added 96 off 74. Mehidy batted with a strike rate of 73.26 while Bangladesh consumed 155 dot balls. But Mehidy later said that they should’ve defended 294. ‘We were satisfied; 294 is a very good score on this kind of pitch,’ said the Bangladesh stand-in captain. ‘Credit goes to them, especially Hope and Rutherford. They got a partnership in the middle over. We didn’t get wickets. I think it was a tough day for our bowlers.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252430/mehidy-blames-bowling-as-tigers-winning-run-ends

Bavuma hails team effort,"South African captain Temba Bavuma said his team’s 109-run win in the second Test against Sri Lanka at St George’s Park on Monday was a big step forward for a largely inexperienced group of players. ‘For a lot of the guys it was a proper taste of what Test cricket is about,’ said Bavuma of a hard-fought match which went into the fifth day. ‘It’s rare when you get to play for five days and it’s also rare when the game is always in the balance. There were times when we were on top and times when Sri Lanka were getting the momentum on their side.’ The win put South Africa on top of the World Test Championship table, which is based on average points gained. South Africa can make certain of qualifying for the final at Lord’s in England next June if they beat Pakistan in a two-match series which starts on December 26. ‘The championship table looks good,’ said Bavuma during the post-match presentation. ‘We see ourselves at number one with two games to go. I don’t know what the maths looks like but we’re playing good cricket and we want it to continue.’ Bavuma was named player of the series after scoring 327 runs in four innings, with a century and three fifties, but said other individuals in the team were making major contributions. Three South Africans made centuries and three bowlers had five-wicket hauls, including left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, who took five for 76 to seal Monday’s win. ‘It’s always a good sign when guys are putting in match-winning performances. It speaks to the hunger and desire amongst the team.’ Sri Lankan captain Dhananjaya de Silva said his team had improved on their performance in Durban, where they were beaten by 233 runs after being blown away for 42 in the first innings. ‘The guys fought hard but it was not good enough,’ said De Silva. ‘The bowling attack that South Africa had kept asking questions.’ De Silva said Sri Lanka were improving in away Test matches. ‘We’re getting better but we need to be 100 percent better in every department,’ he said. Sri Lanka lost their remaining five wickets for 33 runs on Monday. Their hopes of an upset win were extinguished when overnight batsmen De Silva and Kusal Mendis were dismissed inside the first 10 overs of the day. De Silva and Mendis, the team’s last recognised batsmen, resumed on 205 for five, still needing 143 runs to win. Maharaj made the first breakthrough when Mendis edged a low catch to Aiden Markram at slip. He made 46 in a 97-run sixth wicket partnership with De Silva. Kagiso Rabada then had De Silva caught behind for 50, exposing the Sri Lankan tail. The last three wickets fell quickly with Maharaj claiming two more scalps and Marco Jansen finishing the match with his first ball of the day when Lahiru Kumara was caught off a wild slog.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252426/bavuma-hails-team-effort
Troubled Madrid visit Atalanta,"Real Madrid usually deliver in the Champions League when the pressure is on and their trip to face Atalanta on Tuesday is shaping up to be a crucial clash for the troubled holders. The record 15-time winners have lost three of their first five matches and find themselves 24th in the standings, with places 25 to 36 eliminated at the end of the group phase. Carlo Ancelotti’s side travel to Bergamo this week before hosting RB Salzburg and then visiting French outfit Brest with their future in the competition on the line. In-form Atalanta lead Serie A and have not been beaten yet in the Champions League, sitting fifth. Madrid, meanwhile, have been beset by a string of problems including adaptation difficulties for superstar summer signing Kylian Mbappe and several key players sidelined through injury. Italian coach Ancelotti has tried to ease the pressure on 25-year-old former Paris Saint-Germain striker Mbappe, who has scored 11 goals in 21 games since joining Los Blancos. ‘He isn’t at his best level, but we have to give him time to adapt,’ said Ancelotti last week. ‘He can do better and he’s working to do that.’ While Mbappe’s goal rate is not a cause for particular concern, his performances have left plenty to be desired given his status as one of the world’s top players. Recent penalty misses against Liverpool in the Champions League and Athletic Bilbao in La Liga, both matches finishing in defeats, exacerbated the focus on Mbappe, who has also had off-field problems. The striker was not part of two recent France squads, is battling with PSG over an unpaid salary claim and is also reported to be under investigation in Sweden in a rape case. ‘I received nothing, no summons. I read the same thing as everyone else. The Swedish government hasn’t said anything -- I’m not involved,’ Mbappe told Canal+ on Sunday. Madrid have lost key defenders Dani Carvajal and Eder Militao to long-term knee injury problems. Even midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni, whom Ancelotti has turned to as an emergency defender in the past, has also been out hurt, only returning recently. Madrid will also be without Ferland Mendy, Eduardo Camavinga and David Alaba for the visit to face Atalanta. In the good news column they are set to have Brazilian wing wizards Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Goes back fit and available. However Vinicius’ expected return re-opens a debate which was in full flow before he suffered a hamstring injury a fortnight ago. The Ballon d’Or runner-up likes to play on the left wing, which is also Mbappe’s favourite spot. After using Mbappe as a centre-forward for much of the season to date, Ancelotti finally swapped them over for one match before Vinicius was hurt. The coach cited the French forward’s break from international duty as the reason to put him on the wing, whereas Vinicius had returned from playing in South America. Ancelotti suggested Mbappe’s struggles were not just down to him but an issue of consistency affecting the whole team. Although he accepted criticism for Madrid’s form, having lost five games across all competitions already, after stumbling just twice in the whole of last season, Ancelotti said his team would fight. ‘It’s not a funeral -- we’re still fighting in all competitions,’ said Ancelotti last week, following Madrid’s stumble at Athletic, the fifth of those defeats. ‘We have to be optimistic, keeping in mind the problems we’re having and have had. ‘But we have to be optimistic because we have a quality squad. We have not been able to find our best form, but I am convinced we will sooner or later.’ With a thumping 3-0 win over Girona on Saturday in La Liga under their belt, following that up with a show of force at Atalanta would start to ease concerns in the Spanish capital.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/252425/troubled-madrid-visit-atalanta
India’s Adelaide drubbing puts Rohit under scrutiny,"India’s second Test drubbing in Adelaide showed that captain Rohit Sharma was failing to bring the aggression needed to beat Australia on their own turf, leading cricket luminaries said. The tourists were thrashed by 10 wickets inside three days of the pink ball match on Sunday, as Australia levelled the series 1-1. Rohit, 37, returned to lead the team after missing India’s opening win in Perth due to the birth of his second child, but crashed out with scores of three and six. He had dropped down to number six in the batting order from his usual opening slot in favour of KL Rahul, who played a key part in the Perth Test victory. Former India all-rounder Ravi Shastri said Rohit should revert to the top to allow him to play to his attacking strengths. ‘Thought he was a little too subdued, just seeing his body language,’ Shastri told broadcasters on Sunday. ‘That’s the reason I want him at the top. That’s where he can be aggressive and expressive... I just wanted to see him more involved, and a little more animated.’ Former opener Aakash Chopra was more blunt in his criticism of the skipper. ‘Let’s call a spade a spade,’ he said. ‘We saw defensive captaincy. He allowed the match to drift.’ India’s loss was greeted with derision by newspapers on Monday, with a headline in the Times of India calling the third-day finish ‘short and not so sweet’. The Indian Express branded the spectacle ‘Sad-elaide’. Rohit conceded after the loss that India’s batting fell short after the tourists were bundled out for 180 in the first innings of the day-night Test. Former captain Sunil Gavaskar urged Indian batsmen to show more patience and better shot selection in the third Test, starting Saturday in Brisbane. He also said Rohit should be brought back to the top of the order to take advantage of the new ball and make a quick and early total. ‘If he can get going and get to 20-30 then you could have Rohit Sharma getting a big hundred and (that) is the kind of start which you want,’ Gavaskar told broadcaster India Today. Rohit has managed just one 50 -- and eight single-digit scores -- in his last 12 Test innings since India’s home series against Bangladesh in September. He also led India to a 0-3 whitewash against New Zealand -- their first home series defeat in more than a decade -- ahead of the Australia series.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252424/indias-adelaide-drubbing-puts-rohit-under-scrutiny
Girona need ‘magic’ to beat Liverpool,"Girona coach Michel Sanchez said his team needs ‘magic’ from fans at their tiny Montilivi stadium to overcome English giants Liverpool in the Champions League on Tuesday. The Catalan minnows, competing in the competition for the first time in their history, welcome the Premier League leaders who also head the European group table with a 100 percent record. By contrast Girona sit 30th with four defeats from their opening five games, and are fighting to survive in the competition. ‘We will have to run more than ever, but we can do it, of course,’ Sanchez told reporters. ‘They dominate in every way, and that is why we have to think about ourselves, be ourselves and give the best version of ourselves. ‘We will see, with the atmosphere that we have to create... we need the magic of Montilivi to make history.’ Due to UEFA regulations, Girona’s already small capacity is further reduced to under 10,000 seats for European competition. However the lucky few fans inside the stadium will witness a match which Sanchez said he has been waiting to play for years. ‘For me it means a lot, it was a dream as a player, I played in the Europa League with Rayo (Vallecano), reaching the quarter-finals and Liverpool were there as well,’ said Sanchez. Rayo were knocked out in the last eight by Spanish side Alaves, whom Liverpool eventually defeated in the 2001 final in a 5-4 thriller. ‘At Rayo we always sang ‘Next year Rayo vs Liverpool’, that was the dream. ‘After we reached the Champions League it was an opponent I wanted... it will be a special day for Girona, the club, the team and the fans. ‘We have to enjoy it and compete at 100 per cent.’ Sanchez said his dream was now to beat Liverpool 1-0 with veteran Uruguayan striker Cristhian Stuani scoring a 90th-minute winner. The coach explained his team would try to shut down Egyptian winger Mohamed Salah and warned his players they had to be extremely careful after losing the ball. ‘There is always the possibility of controlling a player, every team tries to do that -- (Salah) is in incredible form,’ added Michel. ‘The data says that we are a team that defends well, but there are times when we stop doing it, like in transition and that is where Liverpool are the best team in the world.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/252423/girona-need-magic-to-beat-liverpool
Syria war monitor reports Israeli strikes targeting military sites,"A Syria war monitor said Monday that overnight Israeli strikes targeted military positions and depots in several parts of the country, after Islamist-led rebels ousted president Bashar al-Assad. ‘Since the initial hours after the announcement of the fall of the former regime, Israel began launching intensive air strikes, deliberately destroying weapons and ammunitions depots,’ said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The targets of the overnight strikes included ‘air defence weapons depots and ammunition depots’ belonging to the Syrian military in the coastal Latakia and Tartus provinces, said the Observatory. The Britain-based monitor, which has a network of sources inside Syria, said Israel also launched strikes in the country’s south targeting Tal al-Hara near the Israeli-annexed Syrian Golan Heights, and military positions in Izraa, in Daraa province. Further Israeli strikes destroyed warehouses holding ‘anti-tank weapons’ in the Qalamoun area in the Damascus countryside, the Observatory added. Since Syria’s civil war erupted in 2011, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in the country, mainly targeting the army and Iran-backed groups. Israel rarely comments on individual strikes in Syria but has repeatedly said it will not allow Iran to expand its presence in the country. The overnight raids came after the Observatory said Israeli strikes on Sunday hit a security compound of military, intelligence and customs buildings in the city of Damascus. It said Israeli strikes also hit elsewhere including army positions and weapons depots near the Mazzeh military airport on the city’s outskirts. The Observatory also said Israel on Sunday ‘bombed former military sites’ in southern Syria’s Quneitra province. It also said ‘ground forces penetrated and took control of former regime force observation points’ in the Mount Hermon area, further north closer to the Lebanese border. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday he had ordered the Israeli military to ‘seize’ a demilitarised buffer zone on the border with Syria after Assad’s overthrow, while Israel’s military imposed a curfew for residents of five Syrian towns in the area. The Israeli leader said a 50-year-old ‘disengagement agreement’ between the two countries had collapsed and ‘Syrian forces have abandoned their positions’. As a result, he said, ‘I directed the IDF military yesterday to seize the buffer zone and the commanding positions nearby. We will not allow any hostile force to establish itself on our border.’ Israel seized much of the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and later annexed it in a move largely unrecognised by the international community. Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Saar said Monday the takeover of the buffer zone was a ‘limited and temporary step’.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252422/syria-war-monitor-reports-israeli-strikes-targeting-military-sites
Macron eyes broad alliance to form new French govt,"French president Emmanuel Macron has called for a ‘meeting of different political forces’ to hammer out a programme for a new government, the Greens party leader said on Monday amid a political crisis triggered by prime minister Michel Barnier’s ouster. Macron had suggested a ‘new method’ to put together an executive, Greens chief Marine Tondelier said after meeting him at his Elysee Palace office. After July’s snap elections produced no clear majority, Macron took almost two months to name conservative Barnier as premier. He was then toppled last week in a no-confidence vote over a cost-cutting draft budget for 2025 meant to tackle France’s yawning deficit. New polls are ruled out until the summer, leaving Macron this time around to call for a ‘meeting of different political forces to discuss a platform’ that could unite them in government, Tondelier said. Until now, Macron had only been meeting party leaders individually. But cobbling together any majority will be tricky in a parliament almost evenly divided between the NFP left-wing alliance, Macron’s centrists and conservatives, and the far-right National Rally. Macron was ‘very clear about the fact that as far as he is concerned, the RN is not within the circle of parties willing to talk’, Tondelier said on Monday. The RN had initially helped prop up Barnier’s minority government before supporting his downfall. It leaves the left, centre and centre-right to try and find common ground after clashing fiercely ever since Macron’s first presidential win in 2017. Macron’s call for a broad-based meeting suggests a new executive will not be put together quickly. His ally, parliamentary speaker Yael Braun-Pivet, had earlier said a name should come ‘within the next few hours’. She called for Macron’s centrists to join conservative Republicans (LR), independent MPs and the Socialists to form an absolute majority that would survive a no-confidence vote. Others have called for Macron, 46, to himself resign and trigger a new presidential poll. But a defiant Macron last week said that he planned to serve out the remainder of his term, vowing to produce ‘30 months of useful action’ and promising to name a new prime minister in the ‘coming days’. The weekend reopening of Paris’s Notre Dame cathedral, refurbished after a devastating 2019 fire, offered a brief respite from the political crisis as he hosted world leaders including US president-elect Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. Macron is now under huge pressure to form a government that can survive a no-confidence vote and pass a budget for next year in a bid to limit political and economic turmoil. Allies have urged Macron to move quickly. ‘We can’t go on like this,’ Macron’s centrist ally Francois Bayrou said on Sunday, warning that the French did not want uncertainty to continue. Bayrou heads the MoDem party, which is allied to, but not part of, Macron’s centrist force. He has been tipped as a possible contender for prime minister. ‘If I can help us get through this, I will,’ he said. However many do not support his candidacy. ‘Mr Bayrou’s political line did not win the legislative elections,’ Tondelier told broadcaster RTL ahead of Monday’s meeting with Macron. ‘We need a personality who is compatible with the left,’ added prominent centre-left politician Raphael Glucksmann. A potential split in the left-wing New Popular Front alliance of Greens, Communists, Socialists and hard-left France Unbowed could prove key to building a new government. Formed to help keep the far right out of power, the NFP emerged as the largest bloc in the National Assembly after the summer elections. Its leaders have long insisted that Macron should appoint a prime minister from their ranks, although the president earlier ruled that out. And the latest government crisis has brought NFP infighting to the fore, with LFI insisting that no cooperation with Macron is possible, while other parties have been open to talks. Meanwhile, RN head Jordan Bardella, whose party has not been invited to talks with Macron, earlier demanded a meeting with the future prime minister. ‘You can’t pretend we’re not here,’ he said. Barnier, prime minister for only three months, remains in charge on a caretaker basis until a new government is appointed.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252421/macron-eyes-broad-alliance-to-form-new-french-govt
Evacuations underway as Philippine volcano erupts,"A volcano briefly erupted in the central Philippines on Monday, sending a huge ash column high into the sky as the government ordered the evacuation of surrounding villages. Rising more than 2,400 metres above sea level on the central island of Negros, Kanlaon is one of 24 active volcanoes in the Philippines. A nearly four-minute eruption occurred at 3:03pm (0703 GMT), sending a four-kilometre ash column above the crater and a deadly spurt of hot ash, gases and fragmented volcanic rock about 3.4 kilometres down the mountain’s southeast flank, officials told a news conference. They warned that more explosive eruptions could follow shortly. ‘Getting hit by these pyroclastic density currents is like being run over by a high-speed vehicle,’ said Maria Antonia Bornas, volcano monitoring chief of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. ‘If the ash enters your lungs it would cause asphyxiation,’ she said, urging local officials to evacuate 15 villages within six kilometres of the crater. She said ash from the eruption rained down on several nearby towns and cities around the volcano, though there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. She also warned heavy rain could dislodge the fresh volcanic sediment from the latest eruption, which could bury communities below. “Evacuations are ongoing” in four upland villages of La Castellana town, on the volcano’s southwest slope, municipal police officer Staff Sergeant Ronel Arevalo told AFP, adding he did not have the total number of residents to be evacuated. La Castellana resident Dianne Paula Abendan, 24, used her mobile phone to take a video clip of a giant cauliflower-shaped grey mass of smoke billowing above the crater. “These past few days we’ve seen black smoke coming out of (the) volcano. We were expecting that it would erupt anytime this week,” she told AFP by phone. Abendan said people rushed home to await evacuation orders, but added that the volcanic activity appeared to ease slightly about an hour later. Authorities said flights to and from the Bacolod-Silay international airport, nearest the volcano, remained normal, but carriers were warned from flying below 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) near the volcano. “Flight operators are advised to avoid flying close to the volcano due to possible hazards of sudden steam-driven or phreatic eruptions and precursory magmatic activity,” said an official bulletin from the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines. In September hundreds of nearby residents were evacuated after the volcano spurted thousands of tonnes of harmful gases in a single day. The seismology office said Kanlaon has erupted more than 40 times since 1866. In 1996 three hikers were killed due to ash ejection from the volcano.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/252420/evacuations-underway-as-philippine-volcano-erupts
Kremlin refuses to confirm if Assad in Russia,"The Kremlin declined on Monday to confirm reports that toppled Syrian president Bashar al-Assad had fled to Moscow, adding that it was ‘surprised’ by the rebel takeover. ‘As for Mr Assad’s whereabouts, I’ve got nothing to tell you,’ Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. A Kremlin source told Russian news agencies on Sunday that Assad and his family were in Moscow, hours after he fled the country as Islamist-led rebels entered Damascus. Assad’s son has been studying in the Russian capital. Peskov said on Monday that if Russia granted asylum to Assad and his family, this would be a decision taken by Russian president Vladimir Putin. ‘Of course such decisions cannot be taken without the head of state, and it’s his decision,’ Peskov said. He said there was no meeting with Assad on Putin’s agenda. Russia has given shelter to several ousted leaders, including former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. In brief comments on the dramatic events in Syria over the last few days, Peskov admitted the Kremlin was taken by surprise. ‘What happened has surprised the whole world and, in this case, we are no exception,’ he said. Russia has strategically important army and naval bases in Syria, where it launched a military intervention on the side of Assad in 2015. ‘Now there will be a very complex period due to instability,’ Peskov said. Asked what would happen to Russia’s bases, he said: ‘It is too early to say. This is a subject for discussion with whoever is going to be in power in Syria.’ The Kremlin spokesman said that the security of the bases was ‘very important’. ‘We are doing everything that is possible and necessary to get in touch with those who can provide security. And our military are also taking precautionary measures,’ it said. The Kremlin source quoted by Russian news agencies on Sunday had said the rebels who ousted Assad ‘guaranteed the security of Russian army bases and diplomatic institutions on Syria’s territory’. Syria’s embassy in Moscow raised the opposition flag at the building on Monday, with a spokesman saying the facility was operating normally. Peskov said Russia was ‘in dialogue’ with Turkey, which supported rebel forces in Syria, saying: ‘Here it’s important to maintain dialogue with all countries. We firmly intend to do this and analyse the situation.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252419/kremlin-refuses-to-confirm-if-assad-in-russia
"Australia, Nauru announce security treaty","Australia and Pacific nation Nauru announced a landmark security treaty on Monday, advancing Canberra’s aim of blunting China’s growing regional influence. Nauru surprised many Pacific watchers this year when it abruptly severed diplomatic links with Taiwan in favour of Beijing. It joined a growing list of Pacific nations moving closer to China’s orbit, a development that has rattled Australia and its ally the United States. A new treaty hammered out between Australia and Nauru could stymie China’s efforts to further consolidate its toehold in the Pacific microstate. Under the deal, Nauru will seek Australia’s agreement before it signs any bilateral accords on maritime security, defence and policing. In return, Nauru will receive $64 million in direct budget support and a further $25 million to bolster its stretched police force. ‘This treaty will make our region stronger and it will make our region safer,’ Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese said. ‘It’s a good day for the security and resilience of the Pacific region.’ Nauru president David Adeang said it would give the developing nation a ‘vital’ economic boost while enhancing ‘mutual security’. Security and policing are cornerstones of Beijing’s efforts to win Pacific friends, plying nations such as Solomon Islands and Kiribati with training and gleaming new vehicles. Nauru will also consult Australia if other parties look to strike agreements granting them access to critical infrastructure such as ports and airfields or its banking sector. Australia has committed to keeping a retail bank open on Nauru. Western banks have been closing branches throughout the South Pacific for years, citing political turmoil, wafer-thin profits and the high cost of doing business. State-owned Bank of China has indicated it is eager to fill the gap in Nauru and elsewhere. Australia ratified a similar treaty with low-lying Pacific nation Tuvalu this year. Under that accord, Tuvalu residents will be offered the right to live in Australia if their homeland is swamped by rising seas. Nauru, population 12,500, is one of the world’s smallest countries with a mainland measuring just 20 square kilometres. It is considered especially vulnerable to climate change and has high rates of unemployment and health issues, a recent World Bank assessment said. Nauru was once one of the world’s richest countries per capita, exporting the phosphate mined from the accumulated droppings of circling seabirds. But that boon has long dried up, leaving much of the mainland a barren moonscape unsuitable for either housing or for growing food. For years Nauru replaced some of this lost income by running an immigration detention centre for asylum seekers refused entry to Australia. Solomon Islands, Kiribati and Nauru have all switched diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China since 2019.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/oceania/252418/australia-nauru-announce-security-treaty
Pvt sector credit growth hits 41-month low,"Private sector credit growth in Bangladesh dropped in October to 8.30 per cent, the lowest in 41 months, reflecting deepening challenges in the banking sector and the broader economy. Data from the Bangladesh Bank showed that the credit growth dropped to 8.30 per cent in October, down from 9.2 per cent in September, 9.86 per cent in August, 10.13 per cent in July and 9.84 per cent in June. The October figure is the lowest since May 2021, when the credit growth fell to 7.55 per cent amid the Covid outbreak lockdowns. The credit growth remained above 9 per cent until September 2024, underscoring the severity of the recent downward turn. Bank officials cited stagnant business climate, political unrest and poor law enforcement as major contributors to the slump. Businesses took a wait-and-see policy and avoided making new investments as they thought that law and order situation did not improve notably even after three months of the interim government installed after the ousting of Sheikh Hasina-led government on August 5 through a mass uprising, bankers said. Rising inflation, high lending rates and poor loan recovery also deterred credit growth. The central bank’s contractionary monetary policy, with a policy rate hike to 10 per cent, raised borrowing costs to nearly 15 per cent, making loans excessively expensive for many businesses, bankers said. The banking sector’s capacity to disburse loans has been weakened by rising defaulted loans, deposit withdrawals and liquidity shortages. Banks have sought assistance from the central bank and larger institutions to meet daily cash demands. Massive loan scandals and irregularities during the Awami League regime eroded depositor confidence, prompting many to withdraw funds out of fear of losing their savings. Economic challenges such as high inflation, foreign exchange volatility, dollar shortage and an energy crisis have further dampened business activities, making businesses hesitant to seek bank loans. A dollar shortage in the country has curtailed business operations and reduced the demand for credit. The exchange rate reached Tk 120 from Tk 90 against the US dollar within a couple of years.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/252417/pvt-sector-credit-growth-hits-41-month-low
RMG workers’ yearly increment raised to 9pc,"The annual wage increment for the country’s readymade garment workers has been raised from 5 per cent to 9 per cent, effective from this month. The garment workers would receive the increased wages starting from January 2025. The announcement was made by labour ministry adviser M Sakhawat Hussain at a press briefing following a meeting held at his secretariat office in the city on Monday. Factory owners and labour leaders agreed the 4-per cent rise in the annual increment amid labour unrest in the country’s RMG sector. Thousands of workers from at least half a dozen units in the Ashulia industrial belt staged a work stoppage on Tuesday at their respective factory premises or outside the gates, demanding a 15-per cent annual increment and a Tk 25,000 monthly wage. During the press conference, the labour adviser urged everyone to remain vigilant, saying that a conspiracy was underway concerning the readymade garment sector. The fifth meeting of the ‘Minimum Wage Review and Annual Increment Hike for the RMG Sector’ committee, chaired by labour ministry additional secretary Md Sabur Hossain, was attended by various members, including representatives of factory owners and workers. Sources said that owners’ representatives proposed an 8-per cent annual increment during the meeting, while workers revised their demand to 10 per cent. As the committee could not reach a consensus after more than five hours of discussion, the committee chair, Sabur Hossain, proposed an increase of 4 per cent, resulting in a 9-per cent annual increment. Both the owners’ and workers’ representatives agreed to it and signed an agreement in this regard. At the fourth meeting, factory owners had initially proposed a 6-per cent annual increment, which was later revised to 7 per cent. Labour leaders, who had previously demanded a 15-per cent annual wage increase, revised their proposal to 12 per cent. Currently, the minimum wage for an entry-level garment worker is Tk 12,500, effective since December 2023, up from Tk 8,000.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/apparel/252416/rmg-workers-yearly-increment-raised-to-9pc
"Inflation, investment stagnation remain as concerns: Mintoo","Former Federation of Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Abdul Awal Mintoo on Monday cautioned that high inflation was likely to persist, and investments in Bangladesh could stagnate in the coming years. He attributed these concerns to the challenges faced by the country’s manufacturing sector, stemming from a lack of harmony among key macroeconomic indicators. At an event titled ‘A conversation with ERF members’ held at the Economic Reporters Forum auditorium in the capital Dhaka, Mintoo said that the country’s manufacturing sector was facing its toughest challenges from the prevailing law and order situation and issues in the banking sector. He apprehended that non-performing loans would increase more in the coming days due to the recent circular issued by the Bangladesh Bank in this regard. The business leader mentioned that it was an alarming issue for the country that private sector credit growth had decreased to 8 per cent from the previous 13-14 per cent. He said that the previous government had institutionalised authoritarianism and factionalism while weakening public welfare institutions through excessive party influence. This led to market mismanagement and the prioritisation of policies favouring self-serving politicians and ruling party supporters, Mintoo said. He accused the previous government of enabling corruption, providing legal protection for party-affiliated businesses and facilitating the misuse of state resources. Mintoo said that the low-level weak governance in Bangladesh had become a major urgent headache and cause for concern. The business leader said that a crisis in governance was crippling Bangladesh’s economy, financial systems, and institutions, pulling the country and its labour force into the abyss of degradation. Mintoo, also the chairman of National Bank Limited, criticised the economists who recommended not providing cash support to the country’s week bank any more. Regarding the performance of the capital market, he said that the governments of Bangladesh had failed to establish a functional capital market, which instead of being a platform for long-term investment, had turned into a lottery-like playground. He recommended strengthening the regulatory body first and then enacting policies that support general investors to make the market functional. Regarding the freezing of accounts of businesspersons and their family members, Mintoo said that it was unlawful and that the government should follow due legal processes in such matters. ERF president Refayet Ullah Mirdha and general secretary Abul Kashem also spoke at the event.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/trade-commerce/252415/inflation-investment-stagnation-remain-as-concerns-mintoo
Govt to try to introduce single rate VAT system: NBR chair,"National Board of Revenue chairman Md Abdur Rahman Khan on Monday said that the government would try to introduce single rate VAT system in the country in a bid to reduce leakage in revenue collection. ‘It’ll be better for us if we can go for a single rate VAT to reduce the leakage in revenue collection and it will also be very easy to administer. Definitely we’ll try for that,’ he said. The revenue board chief said this while addressing a press conference on the occasion of VAT Day 2024 at the conference room of the NBR in the capital Dhaka. The theme of this year’s VAT Day is ‘We all will pay VAT and take participation in development’. Abdur said that NBR would try to scrap the VAT exemption gradually to improve the VAT collection. ‘But, it does not mean that this has to be done right now. We’ll do that in consultation with the stakeholders,’ he said. He said that the NBR would supervise the VAT net and would also bring those who were now currently outside the VAT net. ‘We’ve to expand our tax net at the quickest possible time. If we can expand the VAT net, then we’ll be able to reduce the revenue collection gap that already took place in the first five months of the current financial year,’ he said. The NBR chairman said that the country was now going through some tough economic time. ‘If we want to recover our country from this economic situation and thus advance further, we don’t have any other option.’ Asking the VAT officials to work with utmost honesty and sincerity, Abdur said that for the sake of the welfare of the mass people, the government had waived various types of taxes. ‘As a result, the revenue collection has suffered in the last couple of months. So, there is no alternative to reducing the tax waiver,’ he said. He said that whenever the economic situation of the country improved, then it had to try to increase the revenue collection. ‘We’re going towards that direction. We’ll rationalise the tax waiver, we’ve already started our job. Already we’ve scrapped some SROs and some others are in the pipeline,’ he added. The NBR chairman reiterated his call to get rid of the culture of tax exemption, adding, ‘Otherwise, we won’t be able to increase our revenue collection.’ In his introductory speech, the NBR chairman also said that an initiative had been taken to build a robust VAT system to provide all VAT services by making the VAT system completely online and while sitting at home. He mentioned that the NBR was gradually adopting the online system from the paper system. In addition to simplifying the VAT registration, filing and VAT payment procedures, activities have been undertaken to motivate the stakeholders and introduce automation in all stages of work. Already, the VAT registration, filing and VAT payment system has been automated. ‘We’re currently trying to introduce the e-invoice system to build a flawless VAT system,’ he added. Md Abdur Rahman Khan, also secretary of the Internal Resources Division, said that various public welfare-oriented activities had been taken, including providing various types of exemptions for the convenience of the general consumers, reducing the VAT rate on various daily essentials such as sugar, eggs, potatoes and edible oil in the context of the current reality, and withdrawing excise duty on hajj passenger tickets. He said that the NBR was committed to creating a business-friendly environment and building a strong tax culture through timely reforms by involving consumers, traders and industrial owners from all walks of life in the country and above all, and to materialising the dream of building Bangladesh without discrimination. ‘The success of the VAT system depends on the widespread participation of stakeholders. It is hoped that all these promotional activities will be quite helpful in building a tax culture in the country, which will contribute to increasing VAT collection in the future,’ he said. The NBR chairman said that the desired development would be achieved in its continuation. ‘We’ll become a happy, beautiful and prosperous country.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/252414/govt-to-try-to-introduce-single-rate-vat-system-nbr-chair
"Oil prices higher on China boost, Syria uncertainty","World oil prices jumped Monday on fresh moves by China to boost its economy and as traders tracked an uncertain future for Syria and the wider crude-rich Middle East. Major stock markets diverged as investors reacted to political crises in South Korea and France. Gold, seen as a haven investment, gained nearly one per cent. ‘The week has kicked off on a largely upbeat tone following the welcome announcement that Chinese authorities plan to enact further stimulus over the year ahead,’ noted Joshua Mahony, analyst at traders Scope Markets. ‘This shift has already fuelled sharp gains in key assets, with the Hang Seng surging 2.8 per cent and commodities like copper, zinc, iron ore, and palladium rallying on expectations of increased demand.’ Oil prices rose more than one per cent as traders tracked developments in Syria after president Bashar al-Assad fled the country over the weekend as Islamist-led rebels swept into Damascus. Investors also reacted to news China where president Xi Jinping and other top leaders said Monday they would adopt a more ‘relaxed’ approach to monetary policy as they hashed out plans to boost the economy next year. The world’s second-largest economy is battling sluggish domestic consumption, a persistent crisis in the property sector and soaring government debt — all of which threaten Beijing’s official growth target for this year. Leaders are also eyeing the second term of Donald Trump in the White House, with the president-elect indicating he will reignite his hardball trade policies, fuelling fears of another standoff between the superpowers. On Monday, South Korean stocks tumbled as the country was racked with political uncertainty after president Yoon Suk Yeol escaped impeachment following his brief imposition of martial law last week. The won was trading at around 1,432 per dollar Monday, compared with 1,413 on Friday. The euro rose against the dollar, having taken a hit last week when France’s new government fell after a no-confidence vote. The Paris stock market rose in midday deals Monday. President Emmanuel Macron, who had faced calls to step down, lifted sentiment when he said would serve out his term and that a budget could be passed in the coming weeks. Macron held talks with French political leaders on the left and right on Friday as he sought to quickly name a new prime minister after Michel Barnier’s ouster over his 2025 budget plan. The European Central Bank is expected to lower borrowing costs this week.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/power-energy/252413/oil-prices-higher-on-china-boost-syria-uncertainty
India appoints new central bank chief,"India on Monday appointed finance ministry bureaucrat Sanjay Malhotra to helm the country’s central bank, a day before his predecessor’s term was due to end. Sanjay will steer monetary policy in the world’s fifth-largest economy after weeks of speculation over whether his predecessor Shaktikanta Das would have his term extended again. A notification from the Indian cabinet’s appointments committee said Sanjay had been appointed to lead the Reserve Bank of India for a ‘period of three years’ starting from Wednesday. Sanjay is an engineering graduate and has a master’s degree in public policy from Princeton University, according to the finance ministry website. Currently the secretary of the revenue department, he will take charge at a time when pressure has been building on the RBI to cut interest rates as economic growth slows. India’s economy expanded at 5.4 per cent in the September quarter, a nearly two-year low and well below the RBI’s estimates of 7 per cent. Despite this, the central bank’s monetary policy committee has held interest rates steady at 6.50 per cent since February 2023, citing ongoing inflation risks. Local media reports had earlier speculated over the future of Das — first appointed to head the RBI in 2018 — after India’s September quarter GDP data missed estimates. ‘Several quarters of the government have voiced the need for lower interest rates considering inflation excluding food prices,’ analyst Teresa John of Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities said in a note. Sanjay was ‘likely to be familiar with the current thinking in government circles and amenable to their views,’ she added. John said that her firm expected a rate cut by February with growth increasingly likely to ‘undershoot the RBI’s forecast’.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/252412/india-appoints-new-central-bank-chief

Prof Yunus urges India to clear recent ‘clouds’ over bilateral relations,"Bangladesh interim government chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus on Monday described the relations between Bangladesh and India as ‘very solid’ and ‘close’ and sought India’s efforts to clear the ‘clouds’ that had cast a shadow over the relationship in recent times. During his meeting with Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri at the state guest house Jamuna in Dhaka, Professor Yunus urged India to help clear the ‘clouds’ surrounding the situation and raised the issue of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India on August 5 after 15 years of corrupt dictatorship. ‘Our people are concerned because she is making many statements from there. It creates tensions,’ he told the Indian foreign secretary. Misri said New Delhi wanted to increase engagements with Bangladesh’s interim government and make ‘joint and concerted efforts’ to boost relationships between the two neighbours. ‘There is no second thought about increasing engagements. We see this as beneficial for both countries. We want to carry on from where we left off,’ Misri said as they discussed issues of mutual interests. During the 40-minute meeting, the issues of minorities, misinformation campaigns, ousted dictator Sheikh Hasina’s stay in India, regional cooperation and the July-August mass uprising were discussed. ‘We have to do business with the government of the day. This is a major relationship,’ said the Indian foreign secretary. Misri, who held a bilateral meeting with his Bangladesh counterpart earlier in the day, said he monitored events in Bangladesh almost every hour during the July-August mass uprising. The chief adviser elaborated how students, workers and people joined hands in July-August to end Hasina’s corrupt regime through the mass uprising. ‘Our job is to keep their dreams alive. It is a new Bangladesh,’ he said and briefly outlined the reform initiatives undertaken by the interim government. Misri said Indian prime minister Narendra Modi was among the first foreign leaders to greeted Professor Yunus after he assumed office. ‘We wish you every success,’ he said, adding that media narratives and the Indian government’s perception about India-Bangladesh relations are different. He said it was a wrong perception that India had ties with one particular party in Bangladesh. ‘They are not meant for one particular party, but for everyone,’ he said. Professor Yunus called for close bilateral cooperation in floods and water management urged India to join his initiative to revive SAARC. ‘We want to build a prosperous new future for all of us,’ the chief adviser said. Misri said that India continued to engage with SAARC, while there were some obstacles. About the minority issues, the chief adviser said the interim government was committed to protecting every citizen and safeguarding their rights irrespective of their creed, colour, ethnicity and gender. ‘We are a family. We have to work together,’ he said. Misri said India doubled the number of visas for Bangladeshis last month and would increase the number further in the coming days. ‘We can take our relationships forward,’ he said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/252407/prof-yunus-urges-india-to-clear-recent-clouds-over-bilateral-relations

BNP reveals 10-point proposal for electoral reforms,"The Bangladesh Nationalist Party on Monday called for adopting the latest technology in the task to update the voter list, instead of the traditional door-to-door campaigning ahead of the 12th national parliament election. ‘We want a true and accurate voter list to be prepared. Instead of a door-to-door campaign, we propose using computing, and AI [artificial intelligence] to do the job,’ BNP standing committee member Abdul Moyeen Khan said at a press conference. BNP’s committee on election commission arranged the press conference at the party chairperson’s Gulshan office in Dhaka. Moyeen said that if a computerised upgraded system could be adopted, it would help update the voter list accurately without wasting time. ‘A computerised system can easily identify when someone turns 18 and automatically remove the names of those who have passed away. There’s no need for a door-to-door campaign to update the voter list by checking all 18 crore people of Bangladesh.’ The BNP leader also presented a 10-point reform proposal, including amending the RPO, some rules in election management, revising the code of conduct for political parties and candidates, changes to the policy for the registration of political parties, upgrading the election observation policy, increasing the capacity of the election commission, and a separate electoral code of conduct for the media. He said that they had already submitted those reform proposals to the government-formed election reform commission. ‘We prepared reform proposals aiming to create a level playing field so that people can truly cast their votes and elect their real representatives, not dummy or fake representatives.’ Another BNP standing committee member Nazrul Islam Khan said that the government could arrange the national election quickly by implementing the proposals their party had made. ‘We have talked about strengthening the election commission, setting up an election secretariat, and giving them sufficient powers. We also proposed amending and reforming the existing laws... These do not require much time,’ he said. BNP standing committee member Salahuddin Ahmed suggested that it should not take more than three or four months to arrange the election by carrying out the necessary reforms related to the election process.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252400/bnp-reveals-10-point-proposal-for-electoral-reforms
Syrians search for loved ones missing during Assad’s rule,"Syrian rescuers searched a jail synonymous with the worst atrocities of ousted president Bashar al-Assad’s rule, as people in the capital flocked to a central square Monday to celebrate their country’s freedom. Assad fled Syria as Islamist-led rebels swept into the capital, bringing to a spectacular end on Sunday five decades of brutal rule by his clan over a country ravaged by one of the deadliest wars of the century. On Monday, rescuers from the Syrian White Helmets group said that they were searching for potential secret doors or basements in Saydnaya prison, though they said that there was no immediate sign that anyone was trapped. ‘We are working with all our energy to reach a new hope, and we must be prepared for the worst,’ the organisation said in a statement, urging families of the missing to have ‘patience’. Aida Taha, 65, said that she had been ‘roaming the streets like a madwoman’ in search of her brother, who was arrested in 2012. ‘We’ve been oppressed long enough; we want our children back.’ While Syria has been at war for over 13 years, the government’s collapse ended up coming in a matter of days, with a lightning offensive launched by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. In central Damascus on Monday, despite all the uncertainty over the future, the joy was palpable. ‘It’s indescribable, we never thought this nightmare would end, we are reborn,’ 49-year-old Rim Ramadan, a civil servant at the finance ministry, told AFP. ‘We were afraid for 55 years of speaking, even at home, we used to say the walls had ears,’ Ramadan said, as people honked their car horns and rebels fired their guns into the air. ‘We feel like we’re living a dream.’ Others, like Fadwa Mahmoud, whose husband and son are missing, posted calls for help finding their missing relatives. ‘Where are you, Maher and Abdel Aziz, it’s time for me to hear your news, oh God, please come back, let my joy become complete,’ wrote Mahmoud, herself a former detainee. US president Joe Biden said Assad should be ‘held accountable’ as he called his downfall ‘a historic opportunity’ for the people of Syria. ‘The fall of the regime is a fundamental act of justice.’ Amnesty International also called for perpetrators of rights violations to face justice, with its chief Agnes Callamard urging the forces that ousted Assad to ‘break free from the violence of the past’. ‘Any political transition must ensure accountability for perpetrators of serious violations and guarantee that those responsible are held to account,’ UN rights chief Volker Turk said on Monday.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252399/syrians-search-for-loved-ones-missing-during-assads-rule

Indian idol immersion video falsified as Bangladesh temple attack: Fact Watch,"Fact-checking body ‘Fact Watch’ has found that an Indian media falsified a video containing the immersion of Goddess Kali in West Bengal state of the neighbouring country as an attack on a Bangladesh temple. The fact-checking organisation marked the viral video post as false that was shared from the X handle of the Indian media outlet RT India claiming that it was an attack on the temple of Goddess Kali in Bangladesh. The Fact Watch has strong proof that it was actually a video with immersion of Goddess Kali in West Bengal state of India. To confirm the real identity of the viral video, the independent fact-checking entity affiliated with the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh and managed by the Center for Critical and Qualitative Studies (CQS) conducted a search using its various keyframes. In the search, it found a video similar to the viral video uploaded on December 3, 2024, from a Facebook account named Binod Ghosh, said a report published on the Fact Watch website on Sunday. The caption of that video states, ‘In the centuries-old Kali Puja of Sultanpur village in East Burdwan, West Bengal, India, according to ancient custom, every 12 years, the village priests first break the little fingers of the 13-foot-long Kali idol, and then the rest of the idol is broken by people from all walks of life in the village and the broken parts are immersed one by one’. ‘After the immersion, a new idol is built and the idol is worshipped for the next 11 years,’ it said. According to this source, the Fact Watch team also found some other visuals of this religious event by searching with some relevant keywords. There, it is also seen that a large number of people are celebrating and participating in it. Later, a report published in the daily Statesman cited similar details and said that the tradition is over 600 years old. Initially, the Kamar community (similar to Karmakar caste of Bengal) in the village practised this puja and they later handed over the responsibility to the Mondol family. On the other hand, comparing the visuals of the Kali temple from Google Street View with the Facebook videos, it is also confirmed that the temple is located in Sultanpur, West Bengal, India, and not in Bangladesh. Moreover, no reliable evidence was found to support the claim that ‘any Hindu devotee present there was killed’. But, the viral video is being shared claiming that the incident took place in Bangladesh by adding a false communal atmosphere, the fact check body found. It said, ‘Therefore, considering everything, FactWatch has marked the viral posts as false’.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252396/indian-idol-immersion-video-falsified-as-bangladesh-temple-attack-fact-watch
Change in ICT syllabus can boost remittance inflow to Bangladesh: NU VC,"The vice-chancellor of National University, ASM Amanullah, said a change in Information and Technology - ICT syllabus could drastically boost the current remittance inflow to Bangladesh, says a press release. He made the remark at the freshers’ reception programme organised by the Institute of Science & Technology in Dhaka on Monday. Amanullah said if a short and mandatory ICT syllabus could be introduced in the existing NU syllabus, the remittance flow from the expatriates and onshore freelancing to the country would increase up to 100 billion US dollars in just 10 years. He further added that if the present syllabus was reformed in public universities, including NU, it would be very likely to create huge skilled manpower within the country.

Bangladesh urges India not to meddle in internal matters,"Foreign secretary Md Jashim Uddin on Monday said that the government of Bangladesh expected no interference in the country’s internal matter. ‘As we do not make any comments on the internal matter of other countries we expect same from others,’ he said at a press briefing after the Foreign Office Consultation with his Indian counterpart Vikram Misri had concluded in Dhaka city. Following the consultation meeting, the two foreign secretaries held separate press briefings at the foreign ministry on the day. Asking New Delhi to take steps against propaganda by a section of Indian media on minority and religious issues and the July-August student-led mass uprising that ousted the Awami League regime, the foreign secretary said that large or small, all communities in Bangladesh were enjoying religious freedom. Dhaka has also asked Delhi for steps to resolve all outstanding issues, including water sharing of the River Teesta and other international rivers, border killing, tariff and para-tariff. It sought cooperation from Delhi to import power from Nepal, uninterrupted trade of essentials goods, easing issuance of visa, reduce jail-term of Bangladeshis held in Indian jails and return of captured fishermen from India. Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri at his separate press briefing, held at about 4:00pm, read out from a statement that said Delhi looked forward to a positive, constructive and mutually beneficial relationship with Dhaka. He also mentioned that they had discussed certain recent developments and conveyed their concerns to each other. ‘We also discussed some regrettable incidents of attacks on cultural, religious and diplomatic properties,’ he said. Stressing the continuation of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two neighbours, Misri said, ‘I have underlined today India’s desire to work closely with the interim Government of Bangladesh authorities.’ This was the first major bilateral meeting between the two next-door neighbours following the regime change and Sheikh Hasina’s resignation as prime minister and fleeing to India on August 5. At the Bangladesh foreign secretary’s press briefing, Md Jashim Uddin, replying to a question whether Dhaka sought Sheikh Hasina’s repatriation, said that they discussed about the deposed prime minster. Dhaka wanted India to stop the ousted prime minister from making statements from Delhi, said Md Jashim Uddin, adding that Vikram Misri assured him that Sheikh Hasina’s presence in New Delhi would not impact bilateral relations. ‘We’ll work with the government of the day,’ the Bangladesh foreign secretary quoted his counterpart as saying. Her (Sheikh Hasina’s) presence does not have any bearing on our relations, he quoted Misri as saying. Md Jashim Uddin, however, iterated at the press briefing that the foreign ministry would seek Hasina’s repatriation from India if the home ministry asked it to do so. The prescheduled Foreign Office Consultation was held at a time when Bangladesh shut its mission at Agartala in India days back on December 3 on security grounds a day after it was vandalised by Indian protesters during a violent demonstration. Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Verma was also summoned by the foreign ministry in Dhaka over the ‘heinous attack’ on its mission in Agartala, capital of the Tripura state. Answering a question on the attack in Agartala, the Bangladesh foreign secretary said that his counterpart updated him about the stepped-up security measures for Bangladeshi establishments in India. Jashim Uddin also admitted that the relation between the two neighbours was undergoing some strains after the August changeover, and said that the foreign office consultation was a first major bilateral engagement to restore confidence between the two countries. The Indian foreign minister who arrived on the day in the capital on a daylong also called on foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain at his office following the meeting with his counterpart. He also made a courtesy call with chief adviser Muhammad Yunus at the state guest house Jamuna at about 5:00pm. While briefing reporters on Misri’s courtesy call on the chief adviser, environment, forest and climate change adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan said that Delhi wanted a bolstered relation with Dhaka. Dhaka looked forward to Delhi’s active role to revive the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, said the adviser. The Bangladesh foreign secretary said that the next foreign office consultation would likely take place in Delhi next year.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252394/bangladesh-urges-india-not-to-meddle-in-internal-matters
"Begum Rokeya’s works, thoughts surprised me, says Professor Yunus","Recalling the contribution of Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain, commonly known as Begum Rokeya, to social reform, Bangladesh interim government chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus on Monday said her works and thoughts surprised him. He made the remarks while distributing Begum Rokeya Padak-2024 to the recipients at a ceremony at Osmani Memorial Auditorium in Dhaka. Speaking on the occasion, he lauded the courage of Begum Rokeya as she was grown up in very hard time while girls did not get enough scopes to continue their study. Amid the hard time, Rokeya emerged as a courageous girl and lady, the chief adviser said, adding that her imaginary power makes him surprised too. Professor Yunus said everyone had the imaginary power but all were not able to apply it like Begum Rokeya, a prominent Bengali feminist thinker, writer, educator and political activist. Noting that reality is impossible without dream, he proposed introduction of ‘Sultanar Swopna (dream) Award’. A total of four women were awarded with the ‘Begum Rokeya Padak-2024’ for their outstanding contributions to society, women’s education and women's empowerment. Parvin Hasan, vice chancellor of Central Women’s University, Shirin Parvin Haque, founder of women’s rights organisation Nari Paksha, labour and women’s rights activist Taslima Akhtar Lima and Bangladesh’s first female international chess master Rani Hamid were conferred with the award this year. Women and children affairs adviser Sharmeen S Murshid, education adviser Wahiduddin Mahmud and women and children affairs ministry senior secretary Mamtaz Ahmed also spoke on the occasion.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252393/begum-rokeyas-works-thoughts-surprised-me-says-professor-yunus
"Yunus hints at unveiling reform, election process soon","Reiterating that required reforms should be accomplished before holding the next national election, chief adviser professor Muhammad Yunus on Monday hinted that they could come up with a kind of announcement that month on the reform and election process. Referring to the election reform commission, he said that there were certain reforms that were required to finish before the election to avoid old-fashioned problems. In an interactive session with the envoys of European countries at chief adviser’s office in Dhaka, professor Yunus said that they had to wait for the reports of the reform commission to incorporate its proposals in the election process. ‘If the government holds the election now, it will be an old-fashioned one and all the old-fashioned problems will come back,’ the chief adviser observed. He highlighted the interim government’s commitment to building a new Bangladesh that required new policies and new institutional framework. ‘The political parties are very interested in holding the election. We are also interested in holding the election.’ Yunus told the diplomats that he was trying to explain the people about government’s two responsibilities - holding the election and carrying out reforms in various areas. He said that there were 15 different commissions and the government was expecting reports from these commissions by the end of that month to middle of January. ‘We will be ready for the election if the election process reforms are accomplished. This is the direction we are going....two processes are moving in the same direction towards our goal,’ he said. ‘This is a very exciting moment for Bangladesh as this is the month of Victory. And this is a very special occasion to have you all together. It shows the support to Bangladesh - political, economic and moral support,’ professor Yunus said. He added that there was a strong sense of unity that existed in Bangladesh despite some propaganda and misinformation campaign against the country. The chief adviser also presented the initiatives the interim government had taken to reform banking, economy and labour sectors before the European diplomats.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252392/yunus-hints-at-unveiling-reform-election-process-soon
Kremlin refuses to confirm if Bashar al-Assad in Russia,"The Kremlin declined on Monday to confirm reports that toppled Syrian president Bashar al-Assad had fled to Moscow, adding that it was ‘surprised’ by the rebel takeover. ‘As for Mr Assad’s whereabouts, I’ve got nothing to tell you,’ Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. A Kremlin source told Russian news agencies on Sunday that Assad and his family were in Moscow, hours after he fled the country as Islamist-led rebels entered Damascus. Assad’s son has been studying in the Russian capital. Peskov said on Monday that if Russia granted asylum to Assad and his family, this would be a decision taken by Russian President Vladimir Putin. ‘Of course such decisions cannot be taken without the head of state, and it’s his decision,’ Peskov said. He said there was no meeting with Assad on Putin’s agenda. Russia has given shelter to several ousted leaders, including former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. In brief comments on the dramatic events in Syria over the last few days, Peskov admitted the Kremlin was taken by surprise. ‘What happened has surprised the whole world and, in this case, we are no exception,’ he said. Russia has strategically important army and naval bases in Syria, where it launched a military intervention on the side of Assad in 2015. ‘Now there will be a very complex period due to instability,’ Peskov said. Asked what would happen to Russia’s bases, he said: ‘It is too early to say. This is a subject for discussion with whoever is going to be in power in Syria.’ The Kremlin spokesman said that the security of the bases was ‘very important’. ‘We are doing everything that is possible and necessary to get in touch with those who can provide security. And our military are also taking precautionary measures,’ it said. The Kremlin source quoted by Russian news agencies on Sunday had said the rebels who ousted Assad ‘guaranteed the security of Russian army bases and diplomatic institutions on Syria’s territory’. Syria’s embassy in Moscow raised the opposition flag at the building on Monday, with a spokesman saying the facility was operating normally. Peskov said Russia was ‘in dialogue’ with Turkey, which supported rebel forces in Syria, saying: ‘Here it’s important to maintain dialogue with all countries. We firmly intend to do this and analyse the situation.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252391/kremlin-refuses-to-confirm-if-bashar-al-assad-in-russia
Edible oil prices up by Tk 8 per litre,"The government has raised the prices of both the soya bean and palm oil by Tk 8 a litre as per the demand from the businesses to align price with international market rates. After increasing the price of edible oil, the retail price of packaged soybean oil has been set at Tk 175 a litre, up from Tk 167 a litre. Commerce adviser Sk Bashir Uddin announced the new prices for edible oil following a meeting with the edible oil traders at Bangladesh Secretariat on Monday. The revised prices for the edible oil would come into effect on Tuesday. According to the decision, the price of unpackaged soybean oil has been increased to Tk 157 a litre from Tk 149 a litre, while the price of palm oil will also rise from Tk 149 to Tk 157 a liter. The price of a 5-litre bottle of soybean oil has been set at Tk 852, up from Tk 818. During the announcement of new prices of edible oil, commerce adviser told reporters that industry stakeholders had assured they would arrange for supply from today. ‘We have analysed everything realistically and set the price accordingly. By setting the price based on a realistic approach, we hope to put an end to speculation and assumptions from today,’ he said. Bangladesh Vegetable Oil Refiners and Vanaspati Manufacturers Association in a press release said that due to the recent increase in the price of edible oil in the international market, the price of edible oil has been adjusted in the local market following consultations with the commerce ministry. Kitchen markets in Dhaka were gripped by an edible oil crisis, with chaotic price fluctuations and supply inconsistencies over the past two weeks. Retailers said that suppliers had significantly reduced the supply of edible oil, and there was a lack of pricing consistency at all levels, including wholesale and retail. Over the past two months, vegetable oil refiners repeatedly sent letters to the Trade and Tariff Commission requesting an upward revision of edible oil prices, citing increases in the prices of both soybean and palm oil on the international market. In the letters, refiners also mentioned that traders were proceeding cautiously with opening letters of credit for importing edible oil due to the government’s lack of a decision on price adjustments in the local market.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/commodities/252390/edible-oil-prices-up-by-tk-8-per-litre

Bureaucrats taking on multiple roles undermine governance: Debapriya,"Bureaucrats, who assume multiple roles as administrators, politicians and businesspeople, pose a significant challenge to ensuring good governance, observed Debapriya Bhattacharya, convenor of Citizen’s Platform and distinguished fellow of the Centre for Policy Dialogue. Speaking at the concluding session of the Citizen’s Conference 2024 on Monday, he pointed out that such shifting roles erode accountability and trust. ‘A bureaucrat today turns into a politician tomorrow and a businessman the day after. This multiplicity of roles has become a problem,’ Debapriya remarked at the session titled ‘People-centric Reform for Good Governance: Aspirations of Disadvantaged Communities.’ The event was hosted at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre in the capital Dhaka and was organised by Citizen’s Platform for SDGs Bangladesh, with support from the United Nations Development Programme and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. Economist and public policy analyst Debapriya emphasised that these overlapping roles often converged in a single individual, blurring the lines of governance. Debapriya said that, according to a survey, bureaucrats consistently emerged as a dominating force, a sentiment that was echoed in discussions held across different regions of Bangladesh. Addressing the need for robust local governance, Debapriya proposed formation of an independent commission dedicated to strengthening local government institutions. He opined that such a body could prevent arbitrary dismissal of elected representatives on trivial grounds and ensure equitable budget allocations for local government entities. Debapriya also recommended withdrawal of provisions allowing political parties to use electoral symbols, stating that this step could depoliticise local elections and enhance their transparency. Adding to the dialogue, Iftekharuzzaman, executive director of Transparency International Bangladesh and chief of the Anti-Corruption Commission Reform Commission, criticised the ineffectiveness of anti-corruption bodies. He said that institutions tasked with combating corruption were compromised by undue influence from the government and bureaucracy. ‘Anti-Corruption Commission cannot eliminate corruption singlehandedly. The entire populace must raise their voices against it,’ Iftekharuzzaman emphasised. The two-day conference, held from December 8 to 9, brought together experts, policymakers and representatives from marginalised communities to deliberate on reforms aimed at fostering good governance.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/252388/bureaucrats-taking-on-multiple-roles-undermine-governance-debapriya
Professor Yunus seeks EU support to transform Bangladesh’s energy sector,"Chief adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus on Monday urged the European Union to extend support to Bangladesh to transform its energy sector. ‘We look forward to your cooperation on that. We also talked to other countries to provide us support for transformation of our energy sector,’ he said during an interactive session with the diplomats of European countries, stationed in Dhaka and New Delhi. Professor Yunus said environment is, of course, a top priority for them. Bangladesh is a victim of environmental degradation that is taking place, Professor Yunus said, adding, ‘In one area, I get very interested — renewable energy’. The chief adviser said that Bangladesh was going to open a door with Nepal in this regard. Mentioning his meeting with president of the European Commission Ursula Von der Leyen on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September this year, the chief adviser said that when he got the chance to talk to Ursula Von der Leyen, the issue of renewable energy came very strongly. Ursula Von promised to provide all support technology for Bangladesh for transformation of its energy sector, he added.

Public awareness needed to resolve Dhaka’s traffic situation: DMP chief,"Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Sheikh Sajjad Al on Monday expressed concern over Dhaka’s traffic situation and stressed the need for raising public awareness to resolve the issue. ‘Commuters are ignoring the traffic rules. Street vendors occupy footpaths and motorbikes ply on footpaths where pedestrians walk. Since joining on November 21, I have been closely observing these issues. To resolve this chaotic traffic system, public awareness is necessary,’ he said at a press briefing at the DMP media center. After August 5, when the police became inactive the law and order situation deteriorated, leading to rise in the incidents of theft, robbery and overall instability. ‘With everyone’s cooperation we have managed to overcome those challenges.’ ‘In Dhaka, we should ideally have 25 per cent road space but we currently have only 7 per cent. Auto-rickshaws, which were approved during the previous government’s tenure, are adding to the congestion. If these continue, there will be no space for vehicles in Dhaka,’ said the Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner. Sajjad Ali suggested people to try to live closer to their children’s schools or workplaces which could reduce the need for car usage. He also expressed concern about the growing number of motorbike users who ride the vehicle carrying their entire family on it, noting that such practices are highly dangerous. ‘I have instructed the authorities to take action if such practices are observed,’ he said. Expressing concern over the rising snatching incidents particularly during the early hours of the day, the DMP chief said he instructed the Detective Branch to remain vigilant about the crimes. He said he is holding meetings at each police station and emphasised the importance of working with public feedback. In response to a journalist’s question, he said they have a plan to introduce a complaint box and hold open discussions to gather public suggestions. The DMP commissioner further apologised for the action taken by DMP during the July protests, adding, ‘I apologise to the people of the country for the activities that went beyond our professional boundaries. The officers involved have been transferred and disciplinary actions have been taken. We have now started a new phase of service to people.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252386/public-awareness-needed-to-resolve-dhakas-traffic-situation-dmp-chief
3 BNP wings to march towards Agartala Wednesday,"Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s three associate bodies — Jatiyatabadi Juba Dal, Swechchhasebak Dal, and Chhatra Dal — will begin a long march from Dhaka towards Agartala in India on Wednesday to protest against the attack on the Bangladesh mission in Agartala and the desecration of the Bangladesh national flag. Jatiyatabadi Juba Dal central president Monayem Munna on behalf of the three organisations, came up with the announcement in a joint press conference on Monday at BNP’s Naya Paltan central office in Dhaka. The three organisations made the announcement just a day after they held a procession towards the Indian high commission in Bangladesh and submitted a memorandum on Sunday protesting against the attack on the Bangladesh assistant high commission in India’s Agartala. Munna said they would begin their long march from Naya Paltan at 8:00am on Wednesday, and it would end at the Akhaura border. The programme is also meant to register protests against what they describe as an Indian plot to incite communal riots in Bangladesh and spread propaganda against Bangladesh. Calling upon the leaders and activists of the three organisations, Juba Dal president said, ‘I am calling upon all levels of students, youths, and volunteer leaders and activists of Bangladesh to participate in the procession.’ Munna said, ‘We see the violent attacks on Bangladesh’s missions in Agartala as an attack on the country’s independence and sovereignty.’ He said, ‘The Indian government completely failed to protect diplomats as required by the Vienna Convention while various authorities in India have made unnecessary comments on Bangladesh’s internal affairs, causing unrest.’ He also said that India did not express any protest or concern when Sheikh Hasina ordered shoot-at-sight and killed a number of Hindus in Bangladesh. But after Hasina’s fall, India stood against the people of Bangladesh by spreading false and baseless propaganda regarding minority oppression. It gave Sheikh Hasina an opportunity to embarrass the student-citizen government of Bangladesh from Indian soil,’ he added. Swechchhasebak Dal president SM Jilani and Chhatra Dal president Rakibul Islam Rakib were also present at the event. On Sunday, they submitted a memorandum to the Indian high commission to register their protest against the recent anti-Bangladesh incidents in India and demanding an end to misinformation about Bangladesh. Police, however, had blocked their protest march towards Indian high commission near Rampura Bridge in the capital earlier. The Bangladesh mission in Agartala came under attack in the afternoon of December 2 by a group of Indians during their protests demanding the release of Hindu community leader in Bangladesh Chinmoy Krishna Das, now in jail in a sedition case.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/252385/3-bnp-wings-to-march-towards-agartala-wednesday
Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri reaches Dhaka amid tension,"Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri arrived in Dhaka on Monday morning to hold several meetings, which is seen as an opportunity to address mutual concerns.

Establishing mutual communication and meeting each other are very important to overcome any such stalemate,’ he said. Speaking at a seminar at the Jatiya Press Club, Hossain said, ‘I hope the foreign secretaries will have a fruitful discussion.’ He said, ‘It is also important to note that the relations between Bangladesh and India witnessed changes after August 5 and both sides need to try and take forward the relations accepting this changed reality. The downturn that the two countries witnessed over the last few months in terms of bilateral business activities affected both Bangladesh and India, not just Bangladesh got affected, said the adviser. This is the first visit made by a senior Indian government official to Bangladesh since the interim government, led by Nobel laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus, came to power on August 8. The FOC led by the foreign secretaries is a structured engagement between Bangladesh and India. Spokesperson at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mohammad Rafiqul Alam said there are always efforts to keep all the elements of the bilateral relations on agenda. He said that there were some broad areas — trade, border management, connectivity, and water issues — and these would be discussed.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/252384/indian-foreign-secretary-vikram-misri-reaches-dhaka-amid-tension

Dhaka again becomes most polluted city with AQI score of 305,"Dhaka, the overcrowded capital city of Bangladesh, has ranked the first on the list of cities with the worst air quality with an AQI score of 305 at 9:00am on Monday morning. Monday’s air was classified as ‘hazardous,’ posing a grave health threat, according to the AQI index. When the AQI value for particle pollution is between 50 and 100, air quality is considered ‘moderate’, usually sensitive individuals should consider limiting prolonged outdoor exertion, between 101 and 150, air quality is considered ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’, between 150 and 200 is ‘unhealthy’, between 201 and 300 is said to be ‘very unhealthy’, while a reading of 301 and above is considered ‘hazardous’, posing serious health risks to residents. Egypt’s Cairo, Pakistan’s Lahore and Iraq’s Bagdad respectively occupied the second, third and fourth spots on the list, with AQI scores of 211, 180 and 179 respectively. The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. The AQI in Bangladesh is based on five pollutants — particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon. As per World Health Organisation, air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, mainly due to increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/environment-climate-change/252382/dhaka-again-becomes-most-polluted-city-with-aqi-score-of-305

Griezmann seals superb Atletico comeback in Sevilla thriller,"Antoine Griezmann struck a 94th-minute winner to snatch Atletico Madrid a thrilling 4-3 victory over Sevilla on Sunday in La Liga. Diego Simeone's side, third, have won nine matches straight across all competitions and the win pulled them a point behind second-placed title holders Real Madrid and three behind leaders Barcelona. Atletico showed character and quality as they fought back from two goals down in the second half to triumph. Rodrigo De Paul powered Atletico ahead but Dodi Lukebakio equalised for 13th-placed Sevilla. Isaac Romero sent the visitors ahead after half-an-hour and Juanlu Sanchez gave them a 3-1 lead before the hour mark. However, Griezmann pegged one back before substitute Samuel Lino scored a stunning effort from the edge of the box and the Frenchman then blasted home in stoppage time to continue Atletico's superb run of form. Lukebakio gave the ball away for De Paul's opener as he tried to dribble out of a dangerous area. The Argentine midfielder lashed the ball beyond the reach of Sevilla goalkeeper Alvaro Fernandez from the edge of the box in the 10th minute. However the Andalusians were quickly on level terms, with Lukebakio making amends two minutes later. The Belgian forward, on the left of Atletico's area, took one step to beat his marker and smashed home at the near post, catching out Jan Oblak with his powerful strike. Sevilla played with huge intensity, pressing Atletico and throwing themselves into tackles, up for the fight at the Metropolitano stadium in front of over 60,000 fans. They took the lead in the 32nd minute when Romero broke in behind to reach Kike Salas' pass to net his first goal of the season. The striker fired past Oblak, who got a hand to his effort but could not keep the ball out. The hosts battled hard to find a way back in but Francisco Garcia Pimienta's Sevilla soaked up the pressure and netted their third early in the second half. They put together an excellent team move, involving Lukebakio, Djibril Sow and Salas, the latter of whom crossed for Sanchez to slam home at the far post. Atletico were unperturbed and swiftly pulled one back through Griezmann, after an excellent through-ball from Spanish midfielder Pablo Barrios. Sevilla goalkeeper Fernandez made several good saves as the Rojiblancos pushed for an equaliser, denying substitute Alexander Sorloth twice, and the Norwegian striker narrowly missed a tempting cross with a diving header. Atletico pulled level thanks to Lino's spectacular strike from distance, which was reward for their heavy pressure in the second half. Sevilla were under the cosh in the final stages and eventually caved when Griezmann swivelled and smashed the winner past the helpless Fernandez. Earlier, Athletic Bilbao tightened their hold on fourth place with a 2-0 victory over Villarreal, fifth. Aitor Paredes and Inaki Williams struck to help the Basques move six points clear of their opponents, who have played two fewer games. Bilbao have won four consecutive games in the top flight, including beating champions Real Madrid on Wednesday, and are aiming for Champions League qualification next season. ‘We're establishing ourselves in fourth, which is what we wanted,’ said Williams. ‘I think we competed really well, when you're in form, you have to surf the wave.’ Villarreal have now gone four matches without victory in all competitions, including a shock Copa del Rey defeat by fourth-tier Pontevedra in midweek. ‘This defeat hurts a lot, we knew we were facing a direct rival (for the top four),’ said Villarreal defender Kiko Femenia. ‘We know it's very tricky to come here and beat them, and the chances they have, they put away.’ ",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/252380/griezmann-seals-superb-atletico-comeback-in-sevilla-thriller

Rutherford then partnered up with Justin Greaves (41 not out) to add 95 for the sixth wicket, taking West Indies to the brink of victory. ‘I think he's really improved his batting,’ said Hope of his match-winner. ‘We ask for consistency, we always speak about it, and he's showing that. He strikes the ball really well and the hard work is paying off in the middle. He was disappointed not to finish the game.’ After winning the toss and choosing to bat first, Bangladesh made a solid start through opener Tanzid Hasan (60) and skipper Mehidy Hasan Miraz (74).

The Gunners and Chelsea both started the day seven points adrift of Arne Slot's side, whose game this weekend was postponed due to stormy weather. Arsenal were forced to settle for a 1-1 draw but Enzo Maresca's Chelsea, kicking off later Sunday, mounted a stunning comeback at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Dominic Solanke and Dejan Kulusevski put Spurs two goals up inside 11 minutes but Jadon Sancho quickly pulled one back with a fine strike and the second half belonged to the visitors. Cole Palmer equalised from the penalty spot in the 61st minute and Enzo Fernandez put Chelsea ahead 12 minutes later. Palmer's ice-cool ‘Panenka’ spot-kick gave the visitors a two-goal cushion before Son Heung-min added a late third for Spurs. Second-placed Chelsea now have 31 points after 15 games, two points ahead of London rivals Arsenal. Liverpool, with a game in hand, are on 35 points. ‘The plan or the idea is to not let the players slow down,’ Maresca told Sky Sports. ‘They cannot drop because they know another player is waiting to come in.’ But the Italian, in his first season at Stamford Bridge, played down his team's title chances. ‘Arsenal, (Manchester) City and Liverpool probably don't slide like (Chelsea defender Marc) Cucurella did. To be serious, we are not ready, we are far from these teams but we focus on day-by-day and trying to improve the team.’ The defeat is a disastrous result for under-pressure Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou, whose side hammered champions Manchester City 4-0 just two weeks ago. ‘It is a sore one, a painful one,’ said the Australian, whose team are now 11th in the Premier League table after their seventh defeat. Earlier, Bukayo Saka had a late winner ruled out for offside by a VAR review as the Gunners' four-match winning streak was halted in west London. Raul Jimenez fired Fulham into an early lead before William Saliba levelled after yet another Arsenal goal from a corner. ‘We are very disappointed not to win the game -- overall we absolutely dominated the game from start to end,’ Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta told the BBC. ‘We did all the things that we wanted to do during the game and unfortunately we concede one goal in one shot. The way the team played, the way the team wanted to win, it was unbelievable.’ Arsenal were still without influential defensive pair Gabriel Magalhaes and Riccardo Calafiori through injury and Fulham exposed a makeshift left side of the Gunners' backline to take the lead. Kenny Tete's ball in behind was pounced on by Jimenez, who drove forward and fired brilliantly across David Raya into the far corner on 11 minutes. Arsenal underlined their threat from set-pieces when they scored twice from corners to beat Manchester United 2-0 in midweek. Yet for all their preparations, Fulham were still powerless to prevent the corner kings from striking again. Saliba stabbed home Kai Havertz's header from close range for Arsenal's 23rd goal from corners since the beginning of last season. Another corner should have led to the winner but Thomas Partey nodded wide when unmarked from another pinpoint Declan Rice delivery. Saka did head in at the back post as stoppage time approached, but Gabriel Martinelli had strayed offside before supplying the cross. Ruud van Nistelrooy's Leicester struck twice late on to deny Brighton in a 2-2 draw at the King Power. Tariq Lamptey opened the scoring in spectacular fashion with a looping effort into the top corner from outside the box and Yankuba Minteh looked to have sealed the three points for the Seagulls. But Jamie Vardy started the comeback on 86 minutes before teeing up Bobby De Cordova-Reid to snatch a point in stoppage time. Bournemouth also scored twice in the dying minutes to deny struggling Ipswich a first home win in the top flight for 22 years in a 2-1 win at Portman Road.

Pry students to get textbooks by Jan: adviser Bidhan,"Adviser of primary and mass education ministry professor Bidhan Ranjon Roy Poddar on Sunday said that primary level students would receive text books by January but there would be no celebration like before. He also said that 93 per cent primary teachers would be recruited on the basis of merit without maintaining the dependent quota. ‘Tender has been invited for printing primary books for the students so that printing of books is delaying for revising and changing some chapters of all classes,’ he said in replying questions at a press briefing after holding a view exchange meeting with Khulna divisional education officers. Replying another question, the adviser said that some necessary and important stories, including anti-discrimination students’ movement, would be included in the curriculum. He in the view exchange meeting said that the country’s primary schools would be brought under mid-day meal by next five years. ‘In the first phase, the mid-day meal will begin in all primary schools under 150 upazilas of the country.’ Referring to UNESCO, he said that the allotment of national budget in the education sector was very low in Bangladesh among the countries of South Asia which was only two per cent of the total budget. It should be increased to six per cent, according to UNESCO’s observation. ‘The present need is to improve the financial and social status of the primary education which aims at making children literate as well as    making them proficient in linguistics and mathematics,’ he added. The adviser said that a project proposal was sent to the advisory council   for approval for not keeping the quota system in primary teachers’ appointment and seven per cent existing quota system would follow like other jobs.

"RU teachers-employees, students at loggerheads","The teachers, employees and students of Rajshahi University have locked horns over cancelling the existing ward quota for the children and grand-children of the university teachers, officials and employees for admission to undergraduate courses. The teachers and employees are saying that they want the quota facility for their children and grandchildren as an ‘additional benefit’ along with their salary and other facilities while the students are saying that they will never accept such a ‘discriminatory’ quota facility for the university teachers and employees’ children and grandchildren. Earlier on November 14, the RU admission committee decided to cancel the quota facility for freedom fighters’ grandchildren, but to retain the five per cent quota for their children for admission to undergraduate courses under the 2024-25 academic session. They, however, decided to keep the three per cent ward quota for the children and grand-children of the university teachers, officials and employees. Protesting at the university authorities’ decision and demanding immediate cancellation of the ward quota, a group of students started a hunger strike in front of the grave of Professor Syed Mohammad Shamsuzzoha on the same day. The protesting students later postponed their hunger strike on the following day after the university top officials assured them of forming a committee to review the decision on retaining the ward quota for admission. RU pro-vice-chancellor professor Mohammad Main Uddin said that the teachers, officials, and employees wanted to preserve the ward quota for their children and grandchildren for admission as an additional benefit along with their salaries and other facilities. Professor Omar Faruk Sarker, general secretary of RU Teachers Association, meanwhile, told New Age that they had urged the university administration to increase ward quota for the children and grandchildren of the university teachers, officials, and employees to five per cent from the existing three per cent. Contacted, Salauddin Ammar, one of the RU coordinators of the Student Movement Against Discrimination, said, ‘The university teachers, officials, and employees are not backward communities of society. The ward quota must be cancelled,’ he said. Pro-vice-chancellor professor Mohammad Main Uddin said that they were in a perplexed situation over the ward quota issue. ‘We could not publish the admission test circular this year. If we fail to reach a solution to the problem, the admission for the undergraduate courses may be delayed,’ he said. The preliminary application process for the first-year admission is scheduled to begin on January 5 and to end on January 16 while the tests are scheduled to be held on April 12, 19, and 26. Earlier, the government issued a notification on July 23, cutting quotas for freedom fighters’ children and grandchildren to 5 per cent from 30 per cent for jobs in government, semi-government and autonomous institutions amid student protests that led to the fall of the AL-led government on August 5. Rajshahi University students, meanwhile, on Sunday staged a demonstration, displaying red cards to teachers and employees of the university. Several hundred of them brought out a protest procession on the campus at about 2:30pm and later held a rally on the university’s Paris Road reiterating their demand for cancellation of the ward quota.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252370/ru-teachers-employees-students-at-loggerheads
"Iftekharuzzaman for change in political, bureaucratic cultures to end corruption","Anti-corruption initiatives will not be successful unless political and bureaucratic culture changes in the country, said Transparency International Bangladesh executive director Iftekharuzzaman on Sunday. He said that without the changes, anti-corruption initiatives would not be effective even after a model anti-corruption commission was established in the country. Iftekharuzzaman made the remarks at a human chain, organised by TIB marking the International Anti-Corruption Day, held in front of the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban in the capital. He said that the ousted authoritarian government wanted to enjoy complete impunity by misusing power and corruption. As a result, every institution, including the ACC was made dysfunctional and professional partisanship was created. The student-led mass uprising has created an opportunity to bring positive changes, he observed. A complete reform in the ACC from appointments to operational processes is necessary to make it functional, said Iftekharuzzaman. Additionally, the political and bureaucratic entities must uphold the spirit of the uprising to abolish corruption, he mentioned. The interim government has to play a role in establishing an institutional and legal framework so that the next elected government cannot involve in corruption and can carry on the anti-corruption initiatives, said Iftekharuzzaman. TIB deputy coordinator Zafar Sadiq read the concept note at the event marking the International Anti-Corruption Day on December 9. In the concept note, Zafar raised 14-point demand, including establishing a new Bangladesh where people’s voting rights, justice, freedom of speech will be ensured; effective steps to make ACC accountable; an end to political interference in appointments, postings, transfers and judicial processes in judiciary; effective steps to end impunity for corruption in higher level and ensuring transparency and accountability of service providing institutions.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252369/iftekharuzzaman-for-change-in-political-bureaucratic-cultures-to-end-corruption

S Korean opposition plans new impeachment push,"South Korea’s main opposition party said on Sunday it will try again to impeach president Yoon Suk Yeol after his declaration of martial law. Meanwhile police arrested the defence minister in charge of the martial law operation, and the interior minister resigned. Both they and Yoon are being investigated for alleged insurrection. Yoon averted impeachment late Saturday as huge crowds braved freezing temperatures in another night of protests outside parliament to demand the president’s ouster. Opposition parties proposed the impeachment motion, which needed 200 votes in the 300-member parliament to pass, but a near-total boycott by Yoon’s People Power Party doomed it to failure. Lee Jae-myung, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, said Sunday that they will try again on December 14. ‘Yoon, the principal culprit behind the insurrection and military coup that destroyed South Korea’s constitutional order, must either resign immediately or be impeached without delay,’ Lee told reporters. ‘On December 14, our Democratic Party will impeach Yoon in the name of the people.’ In exchange for blocking his removal from office, Yoon’s People Power Party said that it had ‘effectively obtained Yoon’s promise to step down’. ‘Even before the president steps down, he will not interfere in state affairs, including foreign affairs,’ PPP leader Han Dong-hoon said Sunday after a meeting with prime minister Han Duck-soo. This will ‘minimise the confusion to South Korea and its people, stably resolve the political situation and recover liberal democracy’, Han told reporters. But Lee and the National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik, both from the opposition Democratic Party, on Sunday called the arrangement illegal. ‘For the prime minister and the ruling party to jointly exercise presidential authority, which no one has granted them, without participating in constitutional processes to address unconstitutional martial law, is a clear violation of the Constitution,’ Woo said. ‘The power of the president is not the personal property of president Yoon Suk Yeol,’ said Lee. ‘Isn’t this another coup that destroys the constitutional order?’ Kim Hae-won, a constitutional law professor at Pusan National University Law School, called it an ‘unconstitutional soft coup.’ ‘In reality, a political party is merely a private political entity, and handing over the president’s functions to an entity that is neither a constitutional institution nor a state body seems like an action that disrupts the state’s rights,’ Kim said. On Saturday before the vote, Yoon, 63, reappeared for the first time in three days and apologised for the ‘anxiety and inconvenience’ caused by his declaration of martial law. But he stopped short of stepping down, saying he would leave it to his party to decide his fate. Massive crowds — police said there were 1,50,000 people, organisers one million — gathered outside parliament to pressure lawmakers to oust the president. Many wore elaborate outfits, carrying home-made flags and waving colourful glow sticks and LED candles as K-pop tunes blasted from speakers. ‘Even though we didn’t get the outcome we wanted today, I am neither discouraged nor disappointed because we will get it eventually,’ said protester Jo Ah-gyeong, 30, after the impeachment vote. ‘I’ll keep coming here until we get it,’ she said. Regardless of the political situation, police are investigating Yoon and others for alleged insurrection over the extraordinary events of Tuesday night. Early Sunday police arrested Kim Yong-hyun, who quit as defence minister on Wednesday and was slapped with a travel ban, reports said. Interior minister Lee Sang-min on Sunday tendered his resignation which was accepted, Yoon’s office said. Declaring martial law late Tuesday, Yoon said it would safeguard South Korea ‘from the threats posed by North Korea’s communist forces and eliminate anti-state elements plundering people’s freedom and happiness’. Security forces sealed the National Assembly, helicopters landed on the roof and almost 300 soldiers tried to lock down the building. But as parliamentary staffers blocked the soldiers with sofas and fire extinguishers, enough MPs got inside — many climbed walls to enter — and voted down Yoon’s move. The episode brought back painful memories of South Korea’s autocratic past and blindsided its allies, with the US administration only finding out via television. ‘This is a country we’ve spent our entire lives building,’ Shin Jae-hyung, 66, who suffered arrest and torture in the 1970s and 80s as he battled successive military-led regimes, said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/252361/s-korean-opposition-plans-new-impeachment-push
"27 EU envoys stationed in Bangladesh, India set to meet Yunus today","Diplomats representing 27 countries of European Union—20 of them stationed in New Delhi and the rest seven in Dhaka—are set to meet interim government chief adviser Muhammad Yunus today at his Tejagaon office in Dhaka. The government was expecting envoys from all these 27 countries along with  ambassador and head of delegation of the European Union to Bangladesh Michael Miller to join the meeting with Muhammad Yunus at his office, the press wing of the Chief Adviser Office confirmed on Sunday. This will be the first such gathering from the European Union to express their support for Bangladesh and explore new areas and ways for further cooperation with the government at a time when the country is going through a transition after the fall of the authoritarian regime of Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India amid a student-led mass uprising on August 5. Foreign ministry officials engaged in the preparations for the meeting said that it was an opportunity for Bangladesh to explore more areas of cooperation, including trade and climate issues, with the European Union nations. ‘Both sides will explore new areas of cooperation in the meeting besides discussion on the Rohingya crisis, climate issues, GSP+ facilities for Bangladesh in the post-LDC era,’ said foreign ministry spokesperson and director general for public diplomacy wing Mohammad Rafiqul Alam at the weekly briefing at his Segunbagicha office on Thursday while disclosing the date for the crucial meeting. Earlier on November 17, chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said that 27 ambassadors of all the European Union countries would meet him in the next few days without giving any date. ‘Twenty ambassadors from 20 European Union countries based in Delhi along with seven ambassadors from seven countries based in Dhaka are coming to Dhaka in the next few days to meet me,’ Yunus said in his televised address to the nation marking 100 days of the government on that day. Three days after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government, Nobel laureate Yunus took over as the chief adviser of the interim government on August 8. ‘Never before did 27 ambassadors from the EU come together to discuss with the government,’ the chief adviser said. The reason for this gathering was to express the EU support and to develop high-level cooperation in the economic field, he said, adding that ambassadors from many countries, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Finland, Singapore, and Libya, had already met him after the political changeover.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/252360/27-eu-envoys-stationed-in-bangladesh-india-set-to-meet-yunus-today
"Initiative to build shorter rail link between Dhaka, Ctg resumes","The Bangladesh Railway has resumed an old initiative anew to build a rail link along the shortest distance between Dhaka and Chattogram that will significantly reduce the travel time between the capital and the port city. Railway officials said that the new rail link along the chord line, which in railway parlance is the shortest distance between two given railway stations, once built, would reduce journey duration to less than three hours. Currently, uninterrupted trains like Sonar Bangla Express and Subarno Express take about five hours for the journey. The present 321-kilometre Dhaka-Chattogram route follows a long and winding course, touching Tongi and Bhairab before going past Cumilla to reach the port city. The new line that will run via Cumilla and Narayanagnj would be 231–236km long, 85–90km less than the current distance. Railway officials said that establishing rail communication along the chord line became urgent for building a shorter and faster rail link between the capital and the port city. The first initiative was taken on this in 2006 was later abandoned. Then another initiative in 2020 was postponed, to be revived again in October this year. Under the project, the railway has begun a feasibility study and now is waiting for approval from the interim government’s adviser for the railways ministry Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan to carry on with the proposed project, said Bangladesh Railway officials. The authorities are looking into several options for the new rail link. The route of the first two options is same, Shyampur-Narayanganj-Bandar-Sonargaon-Meghna-Titas-Muradnagar-Debidwar-Burichang-Cumilla Adarsha Sadar, while the length of the option one is 80.6km and the option two is 80.05km. The route of the 82.5km-long third option is Shyampur-Narayanganj-Bandar-Sonargaon-Meghna-Titas-Daudkandi-Muradnagar-Chandina-Barua-Cumilla-Adarsha Sadar-Cumilla Sadar Dakkhin. The route of the 89km-long fourth option is Shyampur-Narayanganj-Bandar-Sonargaon-Meghna-Titas-Daudkandi-Muradnagar-Chandina-Barua-Laksam-Cumilla Sadar Dakkhin. On November 25, at a meeting held on the proposed ‘Construction of a chord line from Narayanganj to Laksam/Cumilla’ project at the Rail Bhaban, the officials agreed on principle on the option one based on the issues related to land acquisition, economic benefit and length. The rationale and justification of the feasibility study and detailed design for the proposed project estimates the preliminary estimated cost for the chord line at approximately Tk40,000 crore. This high cost reflects factors, including higher land prices around Dhaka and Narayanganj and the need for substantial viaduct structures, including bridges and culverts, it added. The document also said that the rail link was established during the 19th century British colonial period as a meter-gauge single line section to maximise coverage across the region. At present the rail link still operates primarily with meter-gauge tracks as a double line, with the upgraded dual-gauge double lines on the 72km long Akhaura-Laksam and 21km long Dhaka-Tongi sections. After the 2006 feasibility study, a public-private partnership proposal was sent to the railways ministry in 2012 titled ‘Construction of chord line from Dhaka to Cumilla’ when the estimated cost of the construction had been fixed at about Tk 11,622 crore at that time. In August 2014, the railway signed a memorandum of understanding with China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group Co Ltd for the project but the railway dropped the project as the government gave focus on high-speed rail connection on the section which was also ditched. In 2020, another move was taken to conduct another feasibility study on the plan but in March this year then prime minister Sheikh Hasina directed to postpone the study citing financial crisis, according to the railway officials. After the fall of Sheikh Hasina on August 5 the railway resumed the feasibility study and detailed design for the proposed project in October after getting a nod from the new government, said officials. ‘Currently we are conducting the feasibility study and preparing the detailed design,’ said project director Md Abedur Rahman on Sunday. He also said that they were yet to fix the option and before the detailed design it was difficult to properly estimate the cost of the project. ‘The adviser will give a decision on the proposed project at first as it is a large one,’ he said, adding, ‘then the proposed project will be sent to the Planning Commission for approval. Railway officials said that discussions on building a chord line between Dhaka city and the port city had been going on since the 1970s.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252359/initiative-to-build-shorter-rail-link-between-dhaka-ctg-resumes
Mass uprising renews call to combat corruption,"The country will observe International Anti-Corruption Day today with a fresh call to combat the widespread corruption upholding the spirit of the student-people uprising. Experts said that corruption affected every aspect of the society in the past 15 years of the Awami League rule due to lack of governance and accountability, and indifference of the Anti-Corruption Commission. The Awami League, in its election manifestos, had announced a zero-tolerance policy against corruption and then AL lawmakers, ministers, and deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina had also promised to fight corruption, but the announcements remained on paper only. People have witnessed massive corruption, including money laundering, abuse of power, accumulation of illegal wealth and embezzlement of money from banking and financial institutions in the name of loans, in the past 15 years. The Anti-Corruption Commission, however, failed to check the graft as its independence was also held hostage to the successive governments in the past, the experts said. The governments, by dint of its authority to appoint the top brass of the commission, placed their favoured officers in the commission and maintained comfortable control over it, they said. As a result, the commission’s ability to act independently in fighting corruption has remained severely tied down right from its establishment in 2004, they added. Despite officially being an independent agency, the commission has rather been used as a weapon by the successive governments against their opponents, they observed. For the same reason, the agency could rarely take into account the corruption allegations brought against the powerful ones, particularly politicians, bureaucrats and businesspeople belonging to or associated with the ruling parties, the experts said. Even the commission, in most cases, has failed to initiate an inquiry or file cases against powerful quarters without a go-ahead signal from the government, they said. According to the White Paper on the State of Bangladesh Economy, the country lost $16 billion annually between 2009 and 2023 because of the illicit fund flow amid systemic tax evasion, misuse of exemptions, and poorly managed public finances under the authoritarian AL regime. The white paper, submitted to chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on December 1, underscored the significant fiscal opportunities lost to corruption and stated that halving tax exemptions could double education funding and triple health allocations. TIB executive director Iftekharuzzaman told New Age on Sunday that the promises about zero tolerance against corruption remained only on paper. ‘The corruption is on the rise, and it was also institutionalised in Bangladesh in the past through the tripartite collusion of bureaucracy, politics and business,’ he said. ‘The tripartite collusion had created scope for abusing power, weakening the state structure as corruption, especially high-level corruption and money laundering, increased,’ he added. The past government not only allowed corruption but also gave protection to the corruption, said Iftekharuzzaman. ‘Our young generation created scope of bringing change through mass uprising, so we have to utilise the scope with the spirit of the mass uprising to combat corruption.’ A positive change is, however, a must in bureaucracy and politics to make an effective functional Anti-Corruption Commission to check corruption, he said. According to a TIB survey titled Corruption in Service Sectors: National Household Survey 2023, people paid an estimated Tk 1.46 lakh crore in bribes to get services during the 15 years of AL rule. The survey of 15,515 households revealed that 70.9 per cent of respondents encountered corruption while seeking services in 2023. Between May 2023 and April 2024, service seekers paid about Tk 10,902 crore in bribes, which is 1.4 per cent of the revised national budget for the 2023-24 financial year and 0.2 per cent of the GDP, it says. The survey also found that the Department of Immigration and Passports, the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, and law enforcement agencies were the most corruption-prone sectors, respectively. It said that 50.8 per cent of the surveyed households reported paying bribes or being forced to pay extra for services. Former ACC director general Moyeedul Islam said, ‘The ACC could not play a role as an independent body during AL tenure as the partisan governments held the agency hostage and controlled it.’ He said, ‘All the political governments used the ACC as a weapon for harassing opposition people in the past, but the trend should change to fight corruption.’ He stressed the need for holding the corrupt people accountable to effectively combat corruption. The commission should work effectively this time, as now a neutral government is in power, but top posts of the commission are lying vacant for more than one month, he expressed frustration. The latest Transparency International report published in January also indicated that corruption was increasing in Bangladesh as the country slid two steps to the 10th position from the bottom among the 180 countries covered by its Corruption Perception Index 2023. Bangladesh, which was in the 12th position in the same index in 2022, ranked 149th in 2023, down from 147th position in the previous year, while its points dropped to 24 points out of 100 in 2023 from 25 points in 2022. Bangladesh is the 4th most corrupt country among 31 Asia-Pacific countries and second in South Asia, ahead of only Afghanistan, it said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252358/mass-uprising-renews-call-to-combat-corruption
Debt trap fear mounts over megaprojects,"The megaprojects implemented mostly with foreign loans by the now ousted Awami League regime have left the nation with concerns over the debt trap amid the questionable expected returns. The views have been expressed in the recently released the ‘White Paper on the state of Bangladesh economy’ rebutting the Awami policymakers’ tireless trumpeting that the megaprojects were crucial for achieving high growth. Also serious questions remained centring the quality of the governance regarding projects’ implementation, their justification, viability, costing and financing, and returns, said the white paper written by 12-member committee headed by Centre for Policy Dialogue distinguished fellow economist Debapriya Bhattacharya. Appointed on August 29, the committee submitted its report to the chief adviser on December 1, highlighting an average loss of $16 billion annually between 2009 and 2023 owing to the illicit fund flow amid systemic tax evasion, misuse of exemptions, and poorly managed public finances under the authoritarian Awami regime ousted amid a student-led mass uprising on August 5. Projects having financial involvement of more than Tk 10,000 crore are defined as megaprojects, according to the General Economic Division under the Planning Commission. Bangladesh has 29 such megaprojects whose total budgeted amount stands at around Tk 7,80,000 crore, equivalent to about $87.billion. The then Awami League-led government declared nine of these ambitious megaprojects as fast-track projects that include—Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project; Multi Lane Road Tunnel under the river Karnaphuli; Dhaka Mass Rapid  Transit Development Project; Padma Bridge Rail Link Project; Dohazari to Cox’s Bazar Railway Track; Payra Deep Sea Port; Matarbari Ultra Super Critical Coal Fired Power Project. The revised budget for these seven projects now stands at Tk 1,95,116.87 crore, seeing a massive 70.34 per cent increase from the initially estimated budget of Tk 1,14,547.56 crore. The two other fast-track projects are Maitree Super Thermal Power Project at a cost of Tk 16,000 crore, and Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant at Tk 1,13,092.91 crore which is still being implemented. Identifying that almost all the nine fast-track projects are underwritten by significant external borrowings, the White Paper has found that terms of borrowings are rather stringent with repayment periods of some have either started or are set to start in the near future. ‘This will entail a significant rise in the country’s debt servicing obligations,’ the White Paper says, observing that estimates regarding the returns on investment have not been done following due procedures. The overseas debt repayment hit more than three times higher to Tk 37,307 crore in FY24 than Tk 12,018 in in FY21. A new projection by the government’s Economic Relations Division reveals that the foreign loan repayment will grow 53 per cent to around Tk 57,800 crore in FY25 against Tk 37,775 crore in the outgoing FY24. For an example regarding the returns on investment analysis about the fast-track projects: although the construction cost of the Karnaphuli river tunnel escalated by 26.5 per cent between the development project proforma in 2015 and revised development project proforma in 2022, there was no change in the original estimates of financial analysis that includes returns on investment estimations. The benefit cost ratio through financial and internal rate of return and net present value remained unchanged, mentions the White Paper, adding that the way cost-benefit analysis was carried out for long-term projects is also questionable and needs a serious review. Cost estimates were done at constant prices, while benefit estimates were carried out on the basis of nominal prices. Oftentimes, returns were estimated without consideration of the time lag in the generation of benefits, the White Paper also mentions. Having focused on four major factors—the high construction cost, absence of competitive bidding, constraints faced by the Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division in doing independent evaluation of the fast-track projects, and devaluation of local currency taka against dollars by around 39 per cent in the past two years—the White Paper forebodes that the country may fall into a debt trap if the projects fail to yield expected returns. The paper, while analysing the overall macro-economy, observes that the country’s external debt carrying capacity has weakened due to growing exposure to foreign currency-denominated nonconcessional loans taken for the megaprojects, elevated refinancing risks, and low fiscal and external buffers. Referring to a CPD study, it has also said that the country’s external debt carrying capacity, scaled by exports plus remittances, has indeed weakened in the recent years. The CPD study estimated that the optimal debt to export plus remittance ratio at 124 per cent showed Bangladesh debt exceeded the threshold in FY22, said the White Paper. Not only megaprojects but also many other projects under the annual development programme were taken causing public fund to go to waste. Public money worth $14–24 billion was lost to political extortion, bribery and inflated budgets with the ADPs worth $60 billion in the past 15 years, according to the White Paper that blamed the Awami League for establishing the kleptocracy legacy.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252357/debt-trap-fear-mounts-over-megaprojects
Growing distrust of USA globally,"THE special military operation in Ukraine essentially puts an end to the unipolar world in which the Americans considered themselves the supreme ruler, bossing around other countries. The movement from a unipolar world to a multipolar reality takes several years and this process is not always linear. It is appropriate to recall the words of NG Chernyshevsky: history is not the sidewalk of Nevsky Prospekt; it goes in zigzags, with digressions, etc. The Global South no longer sees the West as a defender of values and the rule of law At the same time, Israel’s war in Gaza, which began in October, 2023, has noticeably accelerated this process. There are many signs that Israel’s horrible military behaviour in the Palestinian enclave under the guise of self-defence had significant geopolitical consequences, which first and foremost manifested themselves in undermining the US’ status as a global superpower. The world is deeply polarised again; the Global South no longer sees the West as a defender of values and the rule of law. The United States has seriously weakened the UN Security Council, repeatedly using its veto power to thwart draft resolutions calling for an unconditional ceasefire in Gaza. The fact that many so-called Western liberal democracies defended Israel’s policy of genocide has undermined the functioning of the existing world order.  US ‘mediation’ in favour of Israel ISRAEL has put itself above the law and it did so with the unconditional support of the United States. For many years, the US, which designated itself the exclusive mediator in the political settlement between Israel and the Palestinians, accepted without any reservations the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, ignoring the demolition of Palestinian houses, murder and the imprisonment of thousands of people. In fact, they encouraged the apartheid regime and used their influence in the UN Security Council to curb any attempts to hold Israel accountable. During the first Trump administration, Washington went even further, unilaterally recognising Israel’s illegal annexation of East Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan Heights. By doing so, the Arab News newspaper emphasised in an article on November 26, ‘the United States itself became a rogue state violating international law and becoming guilty of Israeli war crimes’. Israeli extremists assume that the United States will give them the green light to annex the West Bank of the Jordan River and thereby destroy any prospect of creating a Palestinian state. It is the United States that is guilty of destroying many opportunities to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth noted at the end of November this year that President Bill Clinton, wishing to go down in history as a peacemaker, made a bold diplomatic gesture on December 13, 1998, by visiting Gaza and the site of the future international airport of Palestine. Clinton and his wife Hillary were then greeted by Yasser Arafat and his wife Suha. The US president, whose term in office was ending, privately assured several Arab officials of his intention to declare his support for Palestinian statehood before leaving office. However, as always, his promises only remained on paper. At the end of November this year, some Americans spread rumours that the Biden administration hinted at the possibility of supporting the Security Council resolution calling for the creation of an independent Palestinian state in an attempt to somehow wash the blood off its hands.  The West is no longer at the helm FOLLOWING the sharp international reaction to the war in Gaza, the United States are among the only open supporters of Israel’s actions. This obvious disregard by Washington and its allies for Palestinians lives has seriously undermined their authority and influence in many parts of the globe — and above all in the Global South. The US position in the world is weakening as a result of Russia’s firm and consistent vector, China’s rapid economic growth, the birth of new coalitions of the Global South (such as BRICS, SCO, ASEAN, etc.). Regional powers such as Türkiye, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, Malaysia, etc. are gaining strength. The growing global influence of non-Western cultural movements, especially the media, challenges the power of traditional Western media. The proliferation of diverse sources and social media platforms significantly limits the role of the once dominant Western newspapers and TV channels. Not only is America’s position weakening, but there is an unprecedented drop in confidence in government structures in Western Europe. The transition to a multipolar world is a reality that coincides with the decline of US global hegemony and Trump’s ‘America First’ policy. As the United States retreats to its chambers, its global influence will decrease. In the United States, there is a growing awareness of the decline of the US role in international affairs. The West is no longer at the helm, the Bloomberg agency wrote on November 20; more and more countries no longer want to play by the old rules. The domestic political situation is so tense that Bloomberg concludes that the US is in a revolutionary situation and that the decline of ordinary people’s well-being decreases trust in the ruling elites. However, the West is not going to give up its positions without a fight, so we are yet to face new crises and cataclysms.  New Eastern Outlook, December 7.

Communal harmony important more than ever,"BANGLADESH stands at a crossroads, thick with tension and uncertainty. A nation that has long prided itself on the embroidery of religious and cultural coexistence is now wrestling with the cracks in its communal harmony. The timing could not be worse. Political transition is inherently unstable and in such moments of flux, the consequences of division, particularly communal, can be catastrophic. Recent events have painted an unsettling picture. The arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari has sparked a controversy. His arrest was not an isolated act. It came amid broader demands from minority groups for dignity, protection and representation. While some saw his rally at Laldighi Maidan as an assertion of minority rights, others labelled it as incendiary, with accusations of sedition following close behind. This incident is, however, just one thread in a larger fabric of rising tension. Temples were vandalised, houses were attacked and a sense of fear gripped minority communities in Sunamganj. All this reflects a brewing storm. As always, fingers are point in all directions. One party blames ‘external forces’ and other parties for stoking communal discord. Meanwhile, some claim that it is a deliberate ploy to distract attention from other issues. In this blame game, the people who suffer most are those who have little voice and even less power — the ordinary people, regardless of religion. Bangladesh is no stranger to communal friction. But what is alarming is how such tension is weaponised during this political transition. After the fall of Sheikh Hasina’s government, minority communities have reported increasing incidents of violence. The Hindu Buddhist and Christian Unity Council reported attacks in 29 districts. The irony here is bitter: the alleged attacks often coincide with moments when the nation should be celebrating its diversity. So, those are more political than religious. Political transition creates vacuum and vacuum invites opportunists. It is not surprising that during such time, various groups — political, ideological, even foreign — see an opening to sow division. For Bangladesh’s minority communities, particularly the Hindus, the fear is not abstract. It is lived. They see Chinmoy Krishna Das’s arrest as symbolic of their disappointment and alienation. From their point of view, he demanded straightforward things — protection for temples, better legal safeguards for minority rights and a voice for his community. Yet, his rally is also labelled as a conspiracy against the state. Such responses only deepen the crisis. When minorities see their leaders arrested, their demands dismissed and their safety compromised, it is quite hard for them to believe that they are equal stakeholders. This is particularly dangerous for Bangladesh, where minorities have for long been woven into the social and cultural fabric. It is not just the minorities who are on edge. Mistrust seeps into the majority Muslim community as well, fuelled by narratives that minorities are aligned with foreign interests or political agendas. The narratives are not new, but they gain traction during uncertain times. Each incident, even scattered and whether a vandalised temple or a provocative speech, gets magnified, feeding a cycle of suspicion and retaliation. The result is a society that feels increasingly fragmented. Where neighbours once celebrated each other’s festivals, there is now unease. Where disagreements could be resolved through dialogues, there is now a readiness to accuse. What makes this moment particularly volatile is the role of overthrown political actors. Political transitions are often messy, but in Bangladesh, they have taken on an almost theatrical quality, with each party scrambling to control the narrative. In this scramble, communal tension become a convenient tool. A temple attack becomes a headline to discredit the interim government. A rally for minority rights becomes a ‘foreign-backed conspiracy.’ The real issues — state reforms, education reforms and election reforms — are pushed aside as sectarian fires are stoked. Even more worrying is how quickly tension spills over borders. India has not taken recent incidents lightly. Statements from Indian political leaders, protests along the border and diplomatic back-and-forth have added an international dimension to what should be an internal matter. For Bangladesh, this external spotlight is a curse. It invites foreign interference, complicating an already delicate situation. The cost of this division is not abstract. It is immediate and concrete. There could be economic disruptions as businesses tied to minority communities may face boycotts or attacks. There could be social fragmentation as trust between communities erodes. And, there could be human cost — families being displaced, lives lost and a generation growing up with more hatred than hope. It is also a cost to Bangladesh’s identity. This is a nation born out of a struggle for unity and self-determination, a struggle that drew strength from all its people, regardless of religion. To let that unity fracture now, in the name of political expediency or ideological purity, would be a betrayal of that legacy. Political transitions are supposed to be about renewal, about charting a new course for the future. But that future cannot be built on the rubble of communal discord. Bangladesh’s strength has always been its resilience and its ability to come together in the face of adversity. That resilience is being tested now. Communal harmony is not just a moral imperative. It is practical. At a time when the nation is struggling with economic challenges, political uncertainty and international scrutiny, division weakens the collective strength needed to face the issues. It is like trying to row a boat with half the crew refusing to paddle. Moreover, the world is watching. Bangladesh has for long been a model of a Muslim-majority nation where minorities have a voice and a place. To lose that reputation now, amid rising global Islamophobia and regional tension, would be a tragedy, not just for the nation but also for the example it sets. This is a moment of reckoning for Bangladesh. The choices made now will shape not just the immediate future but the kind of nation it wants to be. Will it succumb to forces of division, or will it rise above, showing that unity is not just a slogan but a lived reality? For those who see the tension and wonder if they matter, the answer is simple: they matter because they strike at the heart of what Bangladesh is. A nation born out of a dream of inclusivity cannot afford to let that dream turn into a nightmare of division. The road ahead is uncertain. But, one thing is clear. Bangladesh needs its people to come together, not as Hindus or Muslims, but as Bangladeshis. Only then can it navigate this storm and emerge stronger on the other side.

Begum Rokeya’s philosophical perspective,"BEGUM Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain, an iconic figure in South Asian feminist thought, stands as a pioneer who championed the cause of women’s emancipation in colonial Bengal. Her progressive ideals and relentless activism align closely with the principles of liberal feminism, which advocate for equality, individual rights, and access to education as pathways to women’s empowerment. By situating Begum Rokeya within the philosophical framework of liberal feminism, this essay explores her intellectual contributions, activism, and relevance in the broader discourse of gender equality and justice. Liberal feminism, rooted in Enlightenment ideals, emphasises the fundamental equality of men and women and advocates for reform through existing legal and political structures. It seeks to eliminate systemic barriers that hinder women’s access to education, employment, and participation in public life. Thinkers such as Mary Wollstonecraft and John Stuart Mill laid the foundation of liberal feminism, arguing for the rational capacity of women and their right to equal opportunities. Unlike radical feminism, which focuses on dismantling patriarchal structures entirely, liberal feminism works within the framework of society to achieve incremental change. The principles of liberal feminism resonate deeply with Begum Rokeya’s vision for social reform. Her advocacy for women’s education, critique of patriarchal traditions, and call for gender equality highlight her alignment with liberal feminist ideals while also reflecting the specific cultural and historical context of colonial Bengal. Central to liberal feminism is the belief that education is a fundamental right and a means of achieving equality. Begum Rokeya recognised education as the most effective tool for empowering women and challenging their subjugation. At a time when Muslim women were largely confined to domestic spaces and denied access to formal education, Rokeya tirelessly campaigned for their intellectual development. In her essays, such asStri Jatir Abanati(The Downfall of Women), Rokeya argued that ignorance perpetuated women’s oppression, as it rendered them incapable of recognising or resisting their subjugation. She emphasised the need for a holistic education system that would enable women to participate actively in public and intellectual life. The establishment of the Sakhawat Memorial Girls’ School in 1911 was a practical manifestation of her liberal feminist philosophy, as it provided a safe space for Muslim girls to learn and grow. From a philosophical perspective, Rokeya’s emphasis on education aligns with John Stuart Mill’s arguments inThe Subjection of Women(1869), where he asserts that denying education to women is a denial of their personhood and potential. Rokeya similarly critiqued societal structures that deliberately excluded women from intellectual pursuits, positioning education as a tool of liberation and self-actualisation. Liberal feminism advocates for the recognition of women as individuals with rights equal to those of men. Begum Rokeya consistently highlighted the importance of individual autonomy and agency for women. In her writings, she often critiqued the oppressive practices of purdah and seclusion, which curtailed women’s freedom under the guise of protecting their honour. In her essayAbarodh Basini(The Secluded Women), Rokeya used satire to expose the absurdity and injustice of practices that confined women to the private sphere. She argued that such restrictions not only violated women’s rights but also deprived society of their contributions. Rokeya’s liberal feminist perspective shines through in her insistence that women should have the freedom to make choices about their own lives, free from the constraints of patriarchal norms. Liberal feminism places great emphasis on rationality, arguing that women are equally capable of reason and should be treated as such. Begum Rokeya’s work is replete with critiques of the patriarchal myths that perpetuated women’s inferiority. She challenged the belief that women were intellectually or morally weaker than men, arguing instead that these assumptions were socially constructed to justify their subordination. In her satirical novellaSultana’s Dream(1905), Rokeya envisions a utopian world called Ladyland, where women’s intellect and leadership create a peaceful and prosperous society. By reversing traditional gender roles, Rokeya not only critiques the irrationality of patriarchal norms but also demonstrates women’s potential to lead and innovate. Her use of satire and imagination serves as a powerful philosophical tool to deconstruct oppressive ideologies and propose alternative ways of thinking. While liberal feminism often focuses on universal principles, Begum Rokeya’s work is deeply rooted in the cultural and historical realities of colonial Bengal. She understood that women’s oppression was shaped by intersecting forces of religion, class, and tradition, and she tailored her activism accordingly. Rokeya’s engagement with Islam is particularly significant in this context. While she critiqued patriarchal interpretations of religious texts, she also sought to reclaim Islam as a source of empowerment for women. Her writings emphasise the egalitarian principles of Islam, which she believed had been distorted by patriarchal customs. This intersectional approach demonstrates Rokeya’s ability to adapt liberal feminist ideals to the specific needs and experiences of her community. Begum Rokeya’s work remains profoundly relevant in contemporary feminist discourse, particularly in regions where women continue to face systemic barriers to education and equality. Her emphasis on education as a pathway to empowerment, her critique of restrictive gender norms, and her call for individual rights resonate with ongoing struggles for gender justice around the world. From a philosophical perspective, Rokeya’s liberal feminism challenges both the cultural essentialism that confines women to traditional roles and the universalism that overlooks the specificities of their experiences. Her ability to navigate these tensions and articulate a vision of feminism that is both universal and context-sensitive makes her a timeless figure in the history of feminist thought. Begum Rokeya exemplifies the principles of liberal feminism through her unwavering commitment to education, gender equality, and individual rights. Her work transcends her historical context, offering a philosophical framework for understanding and addressing the challenges of women’s oppression. By advocating for incremental change within existing structures, Rokeya demonstrated the power of reformist strategies to create lasting social transformation. Through her writings and activism, Begum Rokeya not only advanced the cause of women’s liberation in colonial Bengal but also contributed to the global discourse on gender justice. Her legacy, viewed through the lens of liberal feminism, serves as an enduring reminder of the importance of education, rationality, and individual autonomy in the pursuit of equality. In celebrating Rokeya’s life and work, we honour her as a visionary thinker whose ideas continue to inspire and guide feminist movements in the twenty-first century.

Rokeya’s fight for freedom,"BEGUM Rokeya is remembered and celebrated for her immense contribution to the establishment of women’s rights in British India. Her satirical literary works have modified the thoughts, beliefs, customs and stories of contemporary Muslim society. She rightly pointed out the worthlessness of the tradition that the Muslim society had imposed on women, which had no direct connection with the authentic teachings of Islam. She had to swim against the current to raise awareness about the importance of women’s education. Although there was some practice of female education among the Hindu community, the Muslim women lagged far behind. Her movement confronted the ideology of the cult of true womanhood, summarised in four key tenets: piety, purity, submission and domesticity. In order to provide piety and purity, women were wrapped under layers of clothes, not to be visible to men. Women were unfairly and forcefully located in the private sphere of the household to paint the picture of submissive women. Therefore, it is needless to mention that they were deprived of their right to education, which was their religious obligation too. Rokeya’s essays highlighted her enduring legacy as the master of satire and her social observation. She painted the social status of women as ‘live baggage’ or ‘veiled victims’. She also pointed out that those practices resulted from the biased interpretation and misperception of Quranic teachings by the patriarchal system. Women were not allowed to enjoy daylight, not to breathe in fresh air, let alone the right to education or financial freedom. Rokeya’s strategic vision identified the root causes and she successfully hit the heart of the problem. Her endeavour crossed the boundary of literary work; her dedication culminated in a movement; her battle brought a new era of women’s freedom. She established a women’s school in 1909 with only eight students; she donated her wealth and her entire life to make education available for women who had been domesticated by others as well as by themselves. She would go door to door to invite students to her school by raising awareness among them and often by convincing their households. She went against the so-called values and principles when women’s education was viewed as a sin. Tagore had depicted in his novels, many times, that educated women cannot have a good husband; either they die or their husband dies. In her literary work we see that Rokeya has confidently pointed out the emptiness of societal values and taboos. She has never hesitated to hold her pen against religious misbeliefs and superstitions. She continued her endeavours till her last breath. She proudly announced herself as a dedicated Muslim woman; she emphasised the value of not only reading but also understanding the Quran. She fought against the unnecessary restriction and imprisonment of women at home. Her rational choice, logical mind and moral education led her to the real understanding of Islam. On the other hand, she criticised nudity and shamelessness. Overall, her modest dress code still portrays her as a devout Muslim woman. Her lifelong struggle proved her as a true vicegerent of God on earth. She brought revolutionary changes in the understanding and practices of the Muslim society. In 1916, she founded the Muslim Women’s Association, an organisation that fought for women’s education and employment. It is hard to comment on whether she was influenced by the contemporary feminist movement of the west. She received education from her brothers; her husband was serving the British government. Presumably, she had the privilege to know about the suffragettes. However, the contextual nature of the problems was entirely different. They had to fight specifically for equal political rights and the right to vote. Virginia Woolf advocated women’s reproductive rights and financial empowerment. Rokeya knew that similar approaches were a far cry and were impractical in Indian society. She rightly identified the need for women’s education. Her approach to social reform was not against Islam, but against the wrong interpretation of Quranic ethics and values. She was unique and powerful in her understanding of Islam. Rokeya viewed women’s empowerment in doing righteous deeds and following the teachings of Islam. She endeavoured to invite women towards the dawn that was waiting to embrace them. Rokeya discovered the loving God in her own way, which enlightens women centuries later. She debated the question of divine equality and justice; she explained the fact that there was no unfairness in nature, in the creation of physical beings and in intellectual capacity. She raised the point that boys and girls spend equal amounts of time in their mothers’ wombs before coming to the world. God has created mankind with equal love and design. Therefore, men and women have similar and equal responsibilities in societal development and in maintaining harmony in the family. She encouraged them to learn the Quran, not only by heart but through the intellectual exercise that redesigns the hearts and enriches the souls. Rokeya utilised the financial and moral support she obtained from her family. She became rich from her husband’s wealth. She was a loyal wife and would take utmost care of her diabetic husband. Personal life would never come in her way to achieving her dreams. Worldly glitter could not dazzle her insight; she was far more simple, as she could get rid of the desire to get the beautiful look of artificial glamour. Knowledge was her power; fighting for freedom was her adornment. She was empathetic to her fellow women in the Muslim society. She realised that knowledge is the gateway to freedom; chauvinism and superstition were the hindrances. Hence she began her journey to bring justice to society. The beacon Begum Rokeya brought to the world is still illuminating the lives of women of the twenty-first century.

A welcome step towards renewable energy,"The government offering entrepreneurs land and interconnection to the national grid for a rapid expansion of solar energy is welcome. The Power Development Board is also scheduled to, as the energy adviser announced on December 7, begin open calls for 40 renewable energy projects, mostly for solar power. The Awami League government awarded the projects without bidding and the interim government has cancelled the earlier awards to go for an open invitation. The initiative, if properly implemented and followed by more such offers and facilitation, can help to produce a significant portion of the energy from renewable sources. An overwhelming dependence on imported fossil fuels for power generation and the absence of initiatives to promote cost-competitive renewable energy have, as experts say, held back the transition to renewable energy. Successive governments, especially the deposed Awami League government, came up with a number of road maps and promises to project the transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy in 5–15 years. But when it came to investment and work, there was a pronounced disinclination. This is what was problematic and worrying. All talks about a transition to renewable energy appear to have been nothing but rhetoric. A report by the United States-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis says that Bangladesh did not receive any significant renewable energy investment in 2023. As a signatory to the Paris agreement, Bangladesh is meant to generate 100 per cent electricity from renewable sources by 2050 as it has pledged in the Climate Vulnerable Forum. The government spoke of generating 5 per cent of power from renewables by 2015 and 10 per cent by 2020. But it could not meet the target. Studies show that the investment gap to achieve even the minimum target of power from renewables is huge. The share in the generation of solar and wind power, in fact, declined to 0.77 per cent in 2022 from 0.93 per cent in 2015, as the Berlin-based think tank Agora Energiewende says. The lack of promotion and the placement of barriers to rooftop solar systems have also held back the potential of solar power. An earlier Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis report, published in December 2023, says that Bangladesh lags way behind its neighbours in promoting rooftop solar power and 5,000MW can be produced using only the roofs of industries. In such a situation, the government offering land and connection to the national grid is a step forward. With more such steps, the authorities can unlock the potential of power production from renewable sources. For that, the authorities need to invest adequately and facilitate private investments. The authorities should also promote rooftop solar power. It is high time the authorities reviewed its renewable energy policy and recommitted to renewable sources.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/252320/a-welcome-step-towards-renewable-energy
Govt should pay teachers well to up quality of education,"TEACHERS need to be paid well — well enough so that they can devote their time and energy to teaching without having to worry about the sustenance of the family. This is where the quality of education has suffered, with teachers continuing to go underpaid. Whilst the average salary of schoolteachers at the primary level, which lays the foundation for further education, is about 27 per cent less than the national average monthly per capita income, this is also lower than what their fellows receive in other Asian countries. The white paper on the state of the Bangladesh economy says that the average salary of a primary schoolteacher is $170.02, about 27 per cent less than the average monthly per capita income of $232, keeping to the Bureau of Statistics figure which puts annual per capita income at $2,784 in the 2023–24 financial year. The average monthly salary of a primary schoolteacher is $953.13 in the Maldives, $284.64 in India, $250.44 in Sri Lanka, $206.07 in Pakistan and $189.22 in Myanmar, the informational document, which the committee instituted on August 29 submitted on December 1, says. If teachers fail to maintain a decent standard of living with their salary, they cannot give the optimum level of their intellectual output. In terms of the salary of primary schoolteachers, Bangladesh is ranked in the 45th position among Asian countries and in the seventh position in South Asia. The white paper says that the salary of primary schoolteachers is lower down the rung of the national pay scale. An assistant teacher in government primary schools is paid Tk 19,000 in monthly salary keeping to Grade 13 of the national pay scale, but studies show that the monthly food expenses for a family of four in Dhaka is Tk 22,664. This makes teaching too bleak a prospect for people who have all the qualities to make good teachers to aim for. Teachers of the institutions of tertiary education are no exception. A lecturer in Bangladesh universities earns between $220 and $482 a month. The figure ranges between $770 and $2,420 in India, $700 and $2,800 in Malaysia and $2,950 and $10,300 in Singapore. Experts, therefore, believe that salary and allowances for teachers should be high to ensure the quality of education. Poor salary, as educationalists say, is what holds back skilled and meritorious people from taking up teaching, especially at the primary level. Added to this is the issue of social dignity, which the government should urgently attend to. The white paper says that the political criminalisation of educational institutions has also left a negative social impact, especially on teachers who are meant to work with the institutions for three decades or so. The document further says that the whole culture of education has been ministered in such a way that collusive political and bureaucratic decision-making has laid waste to the dignity of teachers. Whilst the government should, therefore, increase the pay for teachers, it should also nurture the culture of education to afford teachers the required social dignity and, at least, a decent living to ensure a high quality of education.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/252319/govt-should-pay-teachers-well-to-up-quality-of-education
