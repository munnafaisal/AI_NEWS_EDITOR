"2,362 women face violence in 11 months: BMP","Bangladesh Mahila Parishad said that 2,362 women, including 1,036 girls, were victims of violence from January to November in 2023. BMP central legal aid sub-committee shared the information at a press conference at the National Press Club on Tuesday. The press conference was organised by BMP central legal aid sub-committee and Sweden Sverige, in recognition of the international campaign for the elimination of violence against women (November 25 – December 10) and World Human Rights Day 2024. The event was chaired by Fauzia Moslem, president of the BMP central committee, and the written statement was presented by Rekha Saha, secretary of BMP’s central legal aid. Rekha Saha said that the report was prepared based on reports published in 16 national newspapers. The incidents of violence against women and girls, particularly femicide, alarmingly increased. During the period, 486 women and girls were killed for various reasons. Fauzia Moslem said that violence against women was universally recognised as violation of women’s human rights and a severe manifestation of gender inequality. ‘While various laws, policies, and government and non-government initiatives have been put in place to protect women, the situation remains unchanged,’ she added. She said that domestic violence was a major area of concern, caused largely by gender inequality in family laws, which resulted in women being deprived of rights in all aspects of their personal lives. To prevent violence against women and girls, BMP placed 25 recommendations, including ensuring equal rights for sons and daughters, eliminating harmful traditional practices, and ensuring justice for survivors of rape. Maleka Banu, general secretary of the BMP central committee, was present, among others.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252512/2362-women-face-violence-in-11-months-bmp

FSIB employees hold protest outside S Alam residence,"Officials and employees of the privately-owned First Security Islami Bank staged a protest in front of the residence of S Alam Group’s owner in Chattogram, demanding repayment of Tk 35,000 crore. On Tuesday morning, the demonstration took place in the Sugandha residential area under the Panchlaish police station in the city. Over 100 employees from 12 branches of the bank in the Chattogram region participated in the protest. Md Mustafa Kamal, senior vice-president and manager of the bank’s Khatunganj branch, who joined the demonstration, said that the bank’s total investment in various business sectors amounted to Tk 65,000 crore. Of this, Tk 45,000 crore is tied to S Alam Group, with the Chattogram-based branches owed Tk 35,000 crore, he said. Explaining the decision to invest such a significant amount in a single corporate group, Md Mustafa said, ‘We were compelled by the circumstances at the time. The context then was very different from the current scenario.’ He further said, ‘Our bank is facing a liquidity crisis because S Alam Group has failed to repay its dues. These funds are public deposits, and despite repeated demands, we have been unable to recover the money. This protest is part of an effort to create social pressure for repayment.’ First Security Islami Bank was previously majority-owned by S Alam Group.

Haor agriculture becoming dependent on chemicals: dialogue,"Speakers at a dialogue on Tuesday said that the reliance on chemicals for agricultural production increased in haor areas across the country. Multinational companies are playing an important role in the expansion with an ever-growing influence on crop growers. They made the observation at ‘National Haor Dialogue 2024’, organised by BARCIK, Association for Land Reform and Development and the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association in the capital, said a press release issued by the ALRD. BARCIK director Syed Ali Biswas said, ‘Emphasis is being placed on commercial fisheries by leasing haor wetlands, which is leading to the destruction of natural habitats and fish sanctuaries. The diversity of 230 species of native fish is steadily declining.’ He further said that agricultural land was being filled with sand brought by floodwaters, and swamp forests, vital habitats for the region’s fish, had been destroyed. Addressing the event as chief guest, Farida Akhter, adviser to the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock, emphasised that the responsibility for protecting the haor region should not be limited to the Ministry of Water Resources but should involve coordinated efforts by the Ministries of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Livestock. She noted that aman rice was once the primary crop in the country, but now boro rice constitutes 54 per cent of total rice production, with 18 per cent of it produced in the haor areas, where 3,62,730 fishers are registered across seven districts. Highlighting the impact of insufficient river dredging, she said that this prevented haors from accommodating water brought by flash floods. ‘Protecting the haors is an international concern, and we need to engage in discussions with India on transboundary issues affecting the haor region,’ the adviser added. Presenting a review and recommendations on the proposed draft ‘Bangladesh Haor and Wetland Protection, Development, and Management Act 2022’, ALRD programme manager Sanjida Khan Ripa said that the proposed draft granted only the director general or any officer empowered by them the authority to file cases in matters of offense and judgment, meaning complaints from the citizens will not be considered for filing cases, which contradicts the fundamental rights outlined in the constitution. She further noted that the draft law stipulates that no one can file a case against authorities or government officials if they are harmed due to actions taken in good faith under the law, which also contradicts the fundamental rights mentioned in the constitution. To protect the haor region, the speakers emphasised the strict implementation of laws and the immediate cessation of leasing haors.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252503/haor-agriculture-becoming-dependent-on-chemicals-dialogue
A new beginning for NCL T20,"A new dawn in T20 cricket in Bangladesh rises as the NCL T20 league returns after 14 years. The eight-team league starts at two separate venues in Sylhet today. The only edition of the domestic T20 league so far was held in 2010 with six teams participating, where Rajshahi emerged as the champions. That was before the inception of the Bangladesh Premier League—the country’s sole franchise-based league in T20 format. But as BPL is a franchise-based league where often the foreign players dominate, another T20 tournament was always in need among the cricketers and coaches. There had been Port City T20 before the BPL and some editions of DPL T20, but none of those leagues had been held on a regular basis. Now the cricketers will have another platform to hone their skills in the shortest format of the game. The eight teams will be Dhaka, Dhaka Metro, Sylhet, Rangpur, Rajshahi, Khulna, Chattogram, and Barishal, all regulars in the first-class league NCL. All of the matches will be held at two Sylhet venues: the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium and the adjacent Outer Ground, with four matches each day in the group stage. The matches at the main ground will begin at 9:30am and 1:30pm each day, while the two matches at the outer ground begin at 9:00am and 1:00pm, respectively. In a single-league format, every team will play against each other. And after the group stage, there will be a playoff round where the format will be the same as the BPL. The third and fourth teams will face off in an eliminator match, whereas the top two will play in the first qualifier. The loser of the eliminator will be knocked out directly, whereas the winner of the first qualifier will go directly into the final. The winner of the eliminator and the loser of the first qualifier will then take on each other for second place in the final. The playoff matches and the final will be held at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium, with the final scheduled on December 24 at 12:30pm. The tournament will see the return of the likes of Tamim Iqbal and Najmul Hossain Shanto. Tamim, the former national team captain, last played in May in the Dhaka Premier Division cricket League. Meanwhile, current national team captain Shanto was ruled out from the Test and ODI series against the West Indies due to an injury. He is supposed to lead Rajshahi. The BCB announced the eight teams and hosted several programmes ahead of the tournament. It’s reported that the champion team will receive a prize of Tk 20 lakh, whereas the runners-up will get Tk 10 lakh. T Sports will televise 18 matches, whereas all the matches will be streamed on various platforms.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252502/a-new-beginning-for-ncl-t20
City seek CL comfort,"Manchester City’s malaise leaves the English champions in the unusual position of fretting over qualification for the knockout stages of the Champions League ahead of a tricky trip to Italian giants Juventus. City have won just once in their past nine games in all competitions, with an injury crisis and a loss of form for some of their biggest stars leading to the worst run of Pep Guardiola’s managerial career. Despite a 4-1 humbling by Sporting Lisbon and an embarrassing collapse from 3-0 up to draw 3-3 against Feyenoord, they are still in a position to qualify from the new league-phase format. They sit 17th in the 36-team table, with a top-24 finish enough to secure a place in the playoff round at the least. However, their chances of direct entry to the last 16 by finishing in the top eight look slim, with another difficult trip to Paris Saint-Germain to come in January before a home game against Club Brugge. The Champions League is even more significant for City this season with their Premier League title defence seemingly in tatters. After an unprecedented four consecutive English top-flight titles, the champions, in fourth place, trail Liverpool by eight points and Arne Slot’s men also have a game in hand. City have often hit top form down the home straight to win the league during Guardiola’s six title successes in the past seven seasons. This time the mood music around the Etihad is different, with injuries among an ageing squad taking a heavy toll. ‘The season starts difficult, it will be difficult all season,’ said Guardiola after his side’s latest stumble in a 2-2 draw at Crystal Palace on Saturday. ‘We have to survive the season, every game, try to take points, to try to win games and go forward.’ Ballon d’Or winner Rodri is the biggest miss and is unlikely to return again this season after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury in September. John Stones, Nathan Ake, Mateo Kovacic and Oscar Bobb are also sidelined for the trip to Turin, while Kevin De Bruyne, Ruben Dias and Phil Foden are among the big names to have missed significant chunks of the campaign so far. ‘If the squad is this short then it is always so difficult for all the players to play three days after three days,’ said midfielder Bernardo Silva. ‘With a squad of 20 players, if you only have 13 available, it is not good enough.’ City have little time to lick their wounds, with 12 games in 50 days between the Juventus clash and the end of the league phase on January 29. ‘The doctors and physios are working incredible this season like never before I have ever seen but the reality is we have few players to rotate in this period,’ said Guardiola. ‘This season will be like this. ‘Don’t feel sorry, accept the challenge and maybe at the end we will have more satisfaction about the way we behave than in other seasons when we won the titles.’ The hope for City is that they could yet be Champions League contenders if their medical room empties and they find their customary form come the decisive spell of the season in the spring. Just one win from their final three games will almost certainly guarantee qualification. All three of their opponents to come are below them in the table, with Juventus themselves on a four-game winless run and floundering in sixth place in Serie A. City need to look back just two years for inspiration. Defeats to Brentford, Southampton, Manchester United and Tottenham in the winter months of the 2022/23 campaign had Guardiola questioning whether the hunger had gone from his squad after feasting on silverware for so long. A few months later, they lifted the treble, including the club’s only Champions League to date.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/252501/city-seek-cl-comfort

Finance adviser hints at end to tax break,"Finance adviser Salehuddin Ahmed on Tuesday said that the tax exception culture enjoyed by industries over the years was due largely to low domestic revenue generation. ‘Days are numbered for enjoying the tax break,’ said the finance adviser at a seminar on the occasion of ‘VAT Day and VAT Week 2024’ organised by the National Board of Revenue at its head office at Agargaon in the capital Dhaka. The finance adviser said that the local industries were needed to be got rid of tax exemption facility to face the challenges the country’s graduation from the least developed countries’ bloc in 2026 would bring. Many local export-oriented industries which are now enjoying duty preferences in developed and developing countries may lose the benefit, he said. The finance adviser was also critical about the tax evasion for which the country’s tax-GDP ratio has been ridiculed as one of the lowest in the world. He suggested that tax officials should be friendly to taxpayers. He called upon all to pay taxes so that the government is able to increase allocation to health and education sectors. A World Bank report said the county’s income from value-added tax in 2018-19 could have been at least three times higher than the collection of Tk 85,000 crore had the government implemented the VAT law properly.

Collective efforts needed to reform food systems,"Reforming food systems is feasible, but highly complex due to the multitude of stakeholders involved, said Johan Swinnen, director general of the International Food Policy Research Institute, on Tuesday. Speaking at the concluding session of the Annual BIDS Conference on Development 2024, organised by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, Swinnen emphasised the necessity of inclusive collaboration to drive meaningful change. ‘There are far more actors involved than we often recognise within the conventional consumer, producer, and taxpayer model,’ said Swinnen, who is also the managing director of system transformations at CGIAR. ‘This complexity necessitates innovative coalitions to achieve effective transformations.’ Swinnen outlined several key aspects of food system reforms during his presentation titled ‘The Political Economy of Food System Transformation’, including search for non-traditional coalitions, saying that coalitions in food system reforms were often more complex than assumed. ‘It is crucial to identify the diverse roles of producers and consumers within value chains,’ he outlined. He also noted bundling innovations and strategies as one of the key issues for food system transformation. ‘Integrating multiple innovations and strategies is essential, not only for economic viability but also to address political concerns,’ his presentation added. He added that the inherent challenges of food system reforms involved economic and political trade-offs, further complicated by uncertainty due to the complexity of issues. Moreover, the economist said external shocks sometimes triggered reforms. The expert stressed that navigating these challenges requires coordinated efforts across sectors to foster innovation and adapt to changing global dynamics. The conference provided a platform for experts, policymakers and academics to explore pathways toward sustainable development. The discussion highlighted the intricate challenges of food system reforms, underscoring the need for diverse partnerships across sectors to address the multifaceted issues.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/252497/collective-efforts-needed-to-reform-food-systems
Inflated data impeded effective policy making: adviser,"Commerce adviser Sk Bashir Uddin on Tuesday said that the government was facing challenges in stabilising the prices of essential commodities, saying that there were lack of accurate data on production and demand and the discrepancies continued to impede effective policy making. He attributed the situation to inflated statistics introduced by the previous government. The adviser made the remarks while addressing the ERF-PRAN Media Award 2024 giving ceremony as the chief guest at the Economic Reporters Forum auditorium in the capital Dhaka. Bashir said that the recent increase in edible oil prices would burden consumers, and the government was examining ways to help them offset the added costs through price adjustments in other commodities. The government has raised the price of edible oil in response to the realities of both international and local markets, he said. ‘We do not aim to set the price of any commodity; rather, we strive to ensure market competition to guarantee the availability and stable prices of all items,’ the adviser said. He mentioned that the government was considering importing edible oil directly from the international market to facilitate open market sales through the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh. He also highlighted widespread irregularities in the issuance of TCB family cards and dealership licences across the country during the past regime, revealing that the interim government had cancelled 57 lakh family cards out of a total of one crore cards due to irregularities. The commerce ministry aims to resolve the issue within 4-6 weeks, the adviser added. PRAN-RFL Group chairman and chief executive officer Ahsan Khan Chowdhury said that the group introduced the award to promote news reporting on economic development. He said that despite its vast potential, Bangladesh continued to lag in the agricultural sector. Ahsan said that increasing production could be the way to make agricultural products more affordable for consumers. Chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam attributed the price hike of certain commodities to misinformation from the previous administration and the ongoing transformation of the country’s economy. He urged reporters to disseminate accurate information so that the interim government could make the right decisions, saying that the present government is committed to ensuring easy access to information for all. The award was presented in three categories: print, online and television. Five journalists were awarded in the print category, two in the online category and three in the television category. In the print category, Ziadul Islam of Daily Amader Shomoy and Alamgir Hossain of The Daily Shomayer Alo shared the first prize. The second prize went to Jasim Uddin Haroon and FH Humayun Kabir of the Daily Financial Express, while Shahanuare Shaid Shahin of The Daily Kaler Kantho won the third prize. In the online category, Ibrahim Hossain Ovi of Jagonews24.com received the first prize and Mizanur Rahman Chowdhury of The Daily Jugantor earned the second prize. In the television category, Tauhid Hossain Papon of Jamuna TV claimed the first prize, while Tawhidur Rahman of ETV and Horipodo Saha of Independent TV shared the second prize. Bangladesh Journalist Welfare Trust managing director Mohammad Abdullah, ERF president Refayet Ullah Mirdha and general secretary Abul Kashem also spoke at the event.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/trade-commerce/252496/inflated-data-impeded-effective-policy-making-adviser

Air passenger numbers to top five billion in 2025: IATA,"Air passenger numbers are forecast to top five billion for the first time next year and the sector’s revenues will break the trillion-dollar barrier, the global aviation body IATA said on Tuesday. ‘Passenger numbers are expected to reach 5.2 billion in 2025, a 6.7 per cent rise compared to 2024 and the first time that the number of passengers has exceeded the five billion mark,’ the International Air Transport Association said in a statement. Total industry revenues are meanwhile forecast at $1.007 trillion, helped by falling oil and fuel prices, ‘the first time that industry revenues top the $1 trillion mark,’ it added. Revenues will be up 4.4 per cent from 2024, it said. ‘All of this gives us a financial performance which I think is absolutely worth popping the champagne’ for after a post-pandemic rebound, IATA chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen told a news conference in Geneva. The aviation body’s Director General Willie Walsh said in the statement that IATA expected profits of $36.6 billion despite ‘persistent supply chain challenges, infrastructure deficiencies, onerous regulation and a rising tax burden’. Walsh voiced frustration however at delays to aircraft and engine suppliers, accusing them of failing to meet their commitments. IATA said that 1,254 aeroplanes were delivered to airlines in 2024 — 30 per cent fewer than had been predicted — and said there was a backlog of 17,000 undelivered planes. The delays were forcing airlines to run older, less efficient planes, it said. ‘Supply chain issues are frustrating every airline with a triple whammy on revenues, costs, and environmental performance,’ Walsh said in a statement on the issue. ‘Manufacturers are letting down their airline customers and that is having a direct impact of slowing down airlines’ efforts to limit their carbon emissions.’ Plane-maker Boeing saw its production hit this year during a nearly two-month strike by workers. Its rival Airbus in June lowered its production target for the year to 770 from 800, after problems with suppliers. IATA said two per cent of aircraft in the world — about 700 planes — were currently grounded for engine inspections. Airlines have been hit by rising fuel costs since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 but IATA said it expected this factor to ease next year, with the cost of jet fuel averaging $87 a barrel, down from $99 in 2024. ‘Lower oil prices and resulting fuel costs are a major driver of improved prospects for airlines in 2025,’ it said. ‘Should these not materialise for any reason and considering the industry’s thin margins, the outlook could change significantly.’ IATA warned of ‘uncertainties’ linked to the incoming administration of US president-elect Donald Trump. He has threatened heavy tariffs on some imports that could hit demand for air cargo, but is seen as business-friendly and has vowed to stimulate oil production. That would lower oil prices and ‘obviously help our industry in terms of limiting the evolution of our costs’, Owens Thomsen told AFP. IATA represents around 340 companies that account for 80 per cent of world air traffic.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/252494/air-passenger-numbers-to-top-five-billion-in-2025-iata
French internet firm fined 50m euros for unsolicited ads,"France’s largest internet operator Orange was on Tuesday slapped with a 50-million-euro ($53-million) fine for sending unsolicited adverts resembling emails to customers. Orange is the successor to France’s monopoly telephone operator and remains the leading telecommunications firm, with a popular email service. ‘Internet access and email service provider Orange used its email service to introduce advertisements’ that resembled emails in customers’ message feeds, said Louis Dutheillet de Lamothe, deputy head of France’s privacy watchdog CNIL. Advertisers in France are required to obtain permission before sending material to a person’s email address, and CNIL considered Orange’s actions were equivalent to that even if users’ addresses were not used to display the ads between their emails.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/252493/french-internet-firm-fined-50m-euros-for-unsolicited-ads
Israeli strikes kill 25 in Gaza,"Gaza’s civil defence agency said Tuesday that Israeli strikes in the north of the Palestinian territory had killed 25 people, including women and children. ‘At 8:00pm(1800 GMT) last night, Israeli strikes targeted a multi-story building belonging to the Al-Kahlut family, killing 25 people. Sixteen bodies have been identified, while others remain trapped under the rubble,’ civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said, adding five women and five children were among the dead. The Israeli army did not comment on the strike. Bassal said ‘residents, without adequate support, are attempting to rescue those still buried’. The north of the Gaza Strip has been the focus of an intense Israeli military operation for more than two months, which the army says is intended to prevent Hamas militants from regrouping there. Meanwhile, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday he would not stop the war in Gaza ‘now’, with renewed efforts towards a ceasefire underway. Speaking at a press conference in Jerusalem 14 months into the war against Hamas Palestinian militants, he said ‘if we end the war now, Hamas will return, recover, rebuild and attack us again — and that is what we do not want to go back to’. Netanyahu reiterated that he had set the goal of ‘the annihilation of Hamas, the elimination of its military and administrative capabilities’ to prevent future attacks but said that the objective was not yet complete. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said on October 23 that Israel had ‘managed to dismantle Hamas’s military capacity’ and eliminated its senior leadership. With those successes, he said, it was time to ‘get the hostages home and bring the war to an end with an understanding of what will follow.’ In recent days, there had been signs that months of failed ceasefire and hostage release negotiations might be revived and achieve a breakthrough. Qatar, a main mediator, said on Saturday there was new ‘momentum’ for negotiations created by the election of Donald Trump in the United States. The war in Gaza was sparked by Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,208 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official data. Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 44,758 people, mostly civilians, according to data from the Hamas-run health ministry that is considered reliable by the UN. A source close to the Hamas delegation said at the same time that Turkey as well as Egypt and Qatar had been ‘making commendable efforts to stop the war,’ and a new round of talks could begin soon. On Sunday, the prime minister met with the families of hostages held in Gaza and said that Israel’s wars on Hezbollah and Hamas would facilitate negotiations for their release. Protesters, including relatives of the hostages, have repeatedly called for a deal to free the captives and accused him of prolonging the war. The war in Gaza was sparked by Hamas’s  October 7, 2023 attack which resulted in the deaths of 1,208 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official data. During the attack, militants also kidnapped 251 hostages, 96 of whom remain in Gaza, including 34 who the military says are dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 44,758 people, mostly civilians, according to data from the Hamas-run health ministry that is considered reliable by the UN.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252492/israeli-strikes-kill-25-in-gaza
77 Nobel laureates sign letter opposing RFK Jr. as Trump’s health secretary,"Seventy-seven Nobel prize winners on Monday sent an open letter to the US Senate opposing the nomination of Robert F Kennedy Jr., president-elect Donald Trump’s choice for secretary of health and human services, citing his ‘lack of credentials’ and anti-vaccine beliefs. ‘In view of his record, placing Kennedy in charge of DHHS would put the public’s health in jeopardy,’ concludes the letter signed by 77 Nobel recipients in medicine, chemistry, physics and economics. Among the signatories is Drew Weissman, who received the 2023 Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work on developing mRNA vaccines, which was a major breakthrough in the fight against Covid-19. Kennedy, a nephew of assassinated US president John F Kennedy Jr, made his own White House run earlier this year before throwing his support behind Trump. In return, Trump has tapped him to oversee the part of the executive branch in charge of health and medicine — though his selection must be approved by a majority of the US Senate, as outlined by the Constitution. An environmental lawyer by trade with no medical background, Kennedy has spent years professing conspiracy theories linking vaccines and autism, and most recently spread misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines. He has said if he is confirmed for the position he will work to remove fluoride from tap water in the US, despite its addition being considered a major victory against bacteria causing tooth decay. ‘In addition to his lack of credentials or relevant experience in medicine, science, public health, or administration,’ the letter reads, ‘Mr. Kennedy has been an opponent of many health-protecting and life-saving vaccines, such as those that prevent measles and polio.’ ‘We strongly urge you to vote against the confirmation of his appointment,’ the letter said. Kennedy is far from the only Trump cabinet nominee to stir controversy. Among the most notable is Pete Hegseth, a Fox News anchor tapped to lead the Department of Defence, who has seen his nomination derailed with sexual assault allegations and rumours of excessive drinking. And Trump’s first pick for Attorney General, former US Congressman Matt Gaetz, withdrew after further scrutiny emerged of alleged sexual relations he had with a minor.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/north-america/252491/77-nobel-laureates-sign-letter-opposing-rfk-jr.-as-trumps-health-secretary
Taiwan says China carrying out huge maritime deployment,"China is deploying dozens of ships in its biggest maritime mobilisation around Taiwan in years, Taipei said Tuesday, after Beijing voiced fury at President Lai Ching-te’s recent visit to the United States. Taiwanese forces were on high alert in anticipation of Beijing’s People’s Liberation Army staging war games in response to Lai’s US stopovers and call with Republican House speaker Mike Johnson. Taiwan’s defence ministry said the number of Chinese ships in the waters around the island exceeded Beijing’s maritime response to then US House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei in 2022, which was the largest-ever war games. In those drills, Beijing deployed ballistic missiles, fighter jets and warships in what analysts described as practice for a blockade and ultimate invasion of Taiwan — and was a display of how far China’s military had come since the last Taiwan Strait crisis in the mid-1990s. Nearly 90 Chinese naval and coast guard ships were currently in waters along the so-called first island chain, which links Okinawa, Taiwan and the Philippines, a senior Taiwanese security official said. Taiwan’s defence ministry said earlier it had also detected 47 Chinese aircraft near the island in the 24 hours to 6:00am (2200 GMT). That was the highest number of aircraft detected in a single day since a record 153 reported on October 15, after China staged major military drills in response to Lai’s National Day speech days earlier. China — which regards Taiwan as its territory and has not ruled out using force to bring it under its control — has held four large-scale military exercises in just over two years, including the drills in response to Pelosi’s visit and two since Lai took office in May. ‘It can indeed be said that the scale of these maritime forces exceeds the four drills since 2022,’ defence ministry spokesman Sun Li-fang told reporters. Sun said the latest exercises drew forces from three separate Chinese regional commands, while another defence ministry official said China’s actions were ‘not solely directed at Taiwan’. There has been no public announcement by the PLA or Chinese state media about increased military activity in the East China Sea, Taiwan Strait, South China Sea or Western Pacific Ocean, where Taiwan said Chinese ships had been detected. However, a Beijing foreign ministry spokeswoman said Tuesday that China will ‘resolutely defend’ its sovereignty. The lack of an announcement from Beijing was unusual and, if drills were under way, could be a ‘deliberate strategy to sow confusion and exert psychological pressure,’ Duan Dang, a Vietnam-based maritime security analyst, said. ‘China’s current movements resemble what we would see during preparations for real combat, exceeding the scale of previous exercises,’ he added. Taipei-based security analyst J Michael Cole said the mix of PLA navy vessels and coast guard ships highlighted Beijing’s efforts to ‘increase interoperability’ between the two. ‘Such efforts also blur the lines between civilian and military components and thus complicate Taiwan’s ability to respond proportionally,’ Cole said. Beijing has asserted its claims over contested territories in the region far more boldly in recent years, as its military strength has grown. The escalating actions — over islands in the East China Sea claimed by Japan, self-ruled Taiwan, and reefs and islands in the South China Sea that are also claimed by Southeast Asian nations — have come as Beijing’s rivals have drawn closer to the United States. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday that China was the ‘only country in the world that has the intent and, increasingly, the capability to change the rules-based international order.’ ‘We want to see this region, this area remain open to freedom of navigation and the ability to fly the skies and international airways whenever we want to,’ Austin said in a speech aboard the USS George Washington, an aircraft carrier stationed in Japan. ‘We’re going to continue to work with our allies and partners to ensure that we can do just that.’ The United States is Taiwan’s most important backer and biggest supplier of arms, but has long maintained ‘strategic ambiguity’ when it comes to putting boots on the ground to defend the island. Lai said Friday he was ‘confident’ of deeper cooperation with the next Donald Trump administration, a day after he spoke with US Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson that angered China. China’s foreign ministry warned Taiwan on Friday that ‘seeking independence with the help of the United States will inevitably hit a wall’, and called on Washington to ‘cease meddling in Taiwan-related affairs’. The dispute between Taiwan and China goes back to 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek’s nationalist forces were defeated by Mao Zedong’s communist fighters and fled to the island.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/252490/taiwan-says-china-carrying-out-huge-maritime-deployment

Kenyan police teargas anti-femicide march,"Kenyan police tear-gassed a peaceful march against femicide in the capital Nairobi on Tuesday, detaining a number of protesters, according to AFP reporters and rights groups. There was a strong police presence in Nairobi ahead of the march — just one of many planned across the East African country, where violence against women has been a long-running issue. Officers fired tear gas against an initially small group of young women in Nairobi’s Central Business District, AFP journalists saw. The area saw some of the worst police violence during anti-government demonstrations earlier this year. Heavily equipped officers — both uniformed and plain-clothed — also made multiple arrests in the CBD, according to rights groups. AFP witnessed at least one young woman being bundled screaming into the back of a police vehicle. ‘The government is part of the problem,’ said protester Koneli, 38, who declined to give her second name. ‘There is no reason why you should send armed police against people with placards,’ she said. The rally gathered pace in the afternoon as several hundred women marched to parliament, booing and chanting: ‘Shame on you!’ and ‘teach your sons’. The march was repeatedly dispersed by tear gas, with one 22-year-old woman also telling AFP that officers appeared to be targeting women wearing t-shirts with anti-femicide slogans for arrest. ‘How am I going to trust my government to end this if we have barely just got here and we are being tear-gassed already?’ said demonstrator Zeitan, 38. ‘We are not violent we are here to fight for women’s rights,’ protester Akinyi said, shortly before she was tear-gassed. The march follows calls from rights bodies for action over femicide in the country, with the Kenyan National Commission for Human Rights saying in November that 97 women had been murdered in the past three months. President William Ruto addressed parliament on the reports, labelling gender-based violence ‘tragic and unacceptable’ and urging society to address the issue. Amnesty International and the Law Society of Kenya released a joint statement condemning the police actions on Tuesday, saying it sent a ‘chilling message’ to peaceful protesters. ‘The violent response by police, including the arrest of these peaceful protesters, is a direct attack on Kenya’s democratic principles and the human rights of its citizens,’ it said. Kenyan police have previously come under international scrutiny over their tough approach to demonstrations. Peaceful anti-government rallies earlier this year spiralled into violence, leaving at least 60 dead, according to rights groups.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/252488/kenyan-police-teargas-anti-femicide-march
European countries suspend Syrian asylum decisions after Assad’s fall,"Britain, Germany, France, Italy and several other European countries said ON Monday they would freeze all pending asylum requests from Syrians, a day after the ouster of president Bashar al-Assad. While Berlin and other governments said they were watching the fast-moving developments in the war-ravaged nation, Austria signalled it would soon deport refugees back to Syria. Far-right politicians elsewhere made similar demands, including in Germany — home to Europe’s largest Syrian community — at a time when immigration has become a hot-button issue across the continent. Alice Weidel, of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, reacted with disdain to Sunday’s mass rallies by jubilant Syrians celebrating Assad’s downfall. ‘Anyone in Germany who celebrates ‘free Syria’ evidently no longer has any reason to flee,’ she wrote on X. ‘They should return to Syria immediately.’ World leaders and Syrians abroad watched in disbelief at the weekend as Islamist-led rebels swept into Damascus, ending Assad’s brutal rule while also sparking new uncertainty. A German foreign ministry spokesman pointed out that ‘the fact that the Assad regime has been ended is unfortunately no guarantee of peaceful developments’ in the future. Germany has taken in almost one million Syrians, with most arriving in 2015-16 under ex-chancellor Angela Merkel. Interior minister Nancy Faeser said many Syrian refugees ‘now finally have hope of returning to their Syrian homeland’ but cautioned that ‘the situation in Syria is currently very unclear’. The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees had imposed a freeze on decisions for ongoing asylum procedures ‘until the situation is clearer’. She added that ‘concrete possibilities of return cannot yet be predicted and it would be unprofessional to speculate in such a volatile situation’. Rights group Amnesty International slammed Germany’s freeze on asylum decisions, stressing that for now ‘the human rights situation in the country is completely unclear’. The head of the UN refugee agency also cautioned that ‘patience and vigilance’ were needed on the issue of refugee returns. In Austria, where about 1,00,000 Syrians live, conservative chancellor Karl Nehammer instructed the interior ministry ‘to suspend all on-going Syrian asylum applications and to review all asylum grants’. Interior minister Gerhard Karner added he had ‘instructed the ministry to prepare an orderly repatriation and deportation programme to Syria’. ‘The political situation in Syria has changed fundamentally and, above all, rapidly in recent days,’ the ministry said, adding it is ‘currently monitoring and analysing the new situation’. The French interior ministry said it too would put asylum requests from Syrians on hold, with authorities in Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden and Norway announcing similar moves. Britain’s interior ministry said it was taking the same measure ‘whilst we assess the current situation’. The Italian government said late Monday after a cabinet meeting that it too was suspending asylum request ‘in line with other European partners.’ The leader of the far-right Sweden Democrats, a coalition partner in the government, said residence permits for Syrian refugees should now be ‘reviewed’. ‘Destructive Islamist forces are behind the change of power’ in Syria, wrote their leader Jimmie Akesson on X. ‘I see that groups are happy about this development here in Sweden. You should see it as a good opportunity to go home.’ In Greece, a government spokesman voiced hope that Assad’s fall will eventually allow ‘the safe return of Syrian refugees’ to their country, but without announcing concrete measures. In Germany, the debate gained momentum as the country heads towards February elections. Achim Brotel, president of a grouping of German communes, called for border controls to stop fleeing Assad loyalists reaching Germany. The centre-right opposition CDU suggested that rejected Syrian asylum-seekers should now lose so-called subsidiary protection. ‘If the reason for protection no longer applies, then refugees will have to return to their home country,’ CDU legislator Thorsten Frei told Welt TV. CDU MP Jens Spahn suggested that Berlin charter flights to Syria and offer 1,000 euros ($1,057) to ‘anyone who wants to return’. A member of chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats criticised the debate as ‘populist and irresponsible’. Greens party deputy Anton Hofreiter also said ‘it is completely unclear what will happen next in Syria’ and deportation talk was ‘completely out of place’. Many Syrians in Germany have watched the events in their home country with great joy but prefer to wait and see before deciding whether to return. ‘We want to go back to Syria,’ said Mahmoud Zaml, 25, who works in an Arabic pastry shop in Berlin, adding that he hopes to help ‘rebuild’ his country. ‘But we have to wait a bit now,’ he said. ‘We have to see what happens and if it is really 100 per cent safe, then we will go back to Syria.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252487/european-countries-suspend-syrian-asylum-decisions-after-assads-fall

Syria rebels name Mohammed al-Bashir head of transitional govt,"The rebels who ousted president Bashar al-Assad and are now in power in Syria appointed a transitional head of government on Tuesday to run the country until March  1, a statement said. ‘The general command has tasked us with running the transitional government until March 1,’ said a statement attributed to Mohammad al-Bashir on state television’s Telegram account, referring to him as ‘the new Syrian prime minister’. Assad fled Syria as an Islamist-led rebel alliance swept into the capital Damascus on Sunday, ending five decades of brutal rule by his clan. Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the Islamist leader who headed the offensive that forced Assad out, had announced talks on a transfer of power and vowed to pursue former senior officials responsible for torture and war crimes. His group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, is rooted in Syria’s al-Qaeda branch and is proscribed by many Western governments as a terrorist organisation, though it has sought to moderate its rhetoric. The UN envoy for Syria said the groups that forced Assad to flee must transform their ‘good messages’ into actions on the ground. ‘They have been sending messages of unity, of inclusiveness,’ Geir Pedersen said, adding that in Aleppo and Hama, ‘we have also seen reassuring things on the ground’. But ‘what we need not to see is of course that the good statements and what we are seeing on the ground at the beginning, that this is not followed up in practice in the days and the weeks ahead of us.’ The overthrow of Assad, who maintained a complex web of prisons and detention centres to keep Syrians from straying from the Baath party line, sparked celebrations around the country and in the diaspora around the world. The civil war that led up to it killed 5,00,000 people and forced half the country to flee their homes, millions of them finding refuge abroad. The country now faces profound uncertainty after the collapse of a government that had run every aspect of daily life. Jolani, who now uses his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa, vowed: ‘We will not hesitate to hold accountable the criminals, murderers, security and army officers involved in torturing the Syrian people.’ Jolani held talks on Monday with outgoing prime minister Mohammed al-Jalali ‘to coordinate a transfer of power that guarantees the provision of services’ to Syria’s people, according to a statement on Telegram. The fall of Assad has sparked a frantic search by families of the tens of thousands of people held in his security services’ jails and detention centres. As they advanced towards Damascus, the rebels released thousands of detainees, but many more remain missing. A large crowd gathered Monday outside Saydnaya jail, synonymous with the worst atrocities of Assad’s rule, to search for relatives, many of whom had spent years in captivity there, AFP correspondents reported. ‘I’m looking for my brother, who has been missing since 2013. We’ve looked everywhere for him, we think he’s here, in Saydnaya,’ said 52-year-old Umm Walid. ‘Since Bashar is gone, I’m optimistic. The fear is over.’ Crowds of freed prisoners wandered the streets of Damascus, many maimed by torture, weakened by illness and emaciated by hunger. Neighbouring Lebanon and Jordan welcomed home detainees who had been held in Syria for decades. The United Nations said that whoever ended up in power in Syria must hold Assad and his lieutenants to account. How the ousted leader might face justice remains unclear, but UN investigators who for years have been gathering evidence of horrific crimes called Assad’s ouster a ‘game-changer’ because they will now be able to access ‘the crime scene’. While Syrians were celebrating Assad’s ouster, the country now faces enormous uncertainty, and it is unclear whether the dreams of democracy so many sacrificed their lives for will be realised. Concerns about sectarian violence have also surfaced, though HTS has sought to reassure religious minorities they will be safe in the new Syria.984 Further complicating prospects, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it had recorded more than 300 Israeli strikes on the country since Assad’s fall. Pedersen, the UN special envoy for Syria, called on Israel to stop. ‘We are continuing to see Israeli movements and bombardments into Syrian territory. This needs to stop. This is extremely important,’ he said. AFP journalists in Damascus heard loud explosions on Tuesday but could not independently verify the source or scope of the attacks. On Monday, Israel said it had struck ‘remaining chemical weapons or long-range missiles and rockets in order that they will not fall in the hands of extremists’. The Observatory, which relies on a network of sources around Syria, said Israeli strikes had ‘destroyed the most important military sites in Syria’. The group said the strikes targeted weapons depots, naval vessels and a research centre that Western governments suspected of having links to chemical weapons production. In the port city of Latakia, smoke was still rising Tuesday from the wreckage of naval vessels half under water in the harbour, an AFP correspondent reported. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz confirmed that the military had been operating in Syria in recent days to ‘destroy strategic capabilities that threaten the State of Israel’. ‘The navy operated last night to destroy the Syrian fleet with great success,’ he said. Israel, which borders Syria, also sent troops into the UN-patrolled buffer zone east of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. The defence minister said the military had orders to ‘establish a sterile defence zone free of weapons and terrorist threats in southern Syria, without a permanent Israeli presence.’ Israel backer the United States said the incursion must be ‘temporary’, after the United Nations said Israel was violating the 1974 armistice. Assad spent years suppressing rebellion using everything in his means, including air strikes and even chemical weapons, but he was ultimately deposed in a lightning offensive that lasted less than two weeks.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252485/syria-rebels-name-mohammed-al-bashir-head-of-transitional-govt
BNP for RAB’s abolition,"The Bangladesh Nationalist Party recommended the abolition of the Rapid Action Battalion, citing allegations of human rights violations and extrajudicial killings. It made the recommendation to the Police Reform Committee the interim government has recently formed. BNP standing committee member retired major Hafizuddin Ahmed came up with the recommendation at a press conference on Tuesday at the party chairperson’s office at Gulshan in the capital. Mentioning that the force already faced harsh criticism at home and abroad, he said that the RAB became a ‘monster’ in the eyes of the country’s people. ‘We recommend the RAB’s abolition for their involvement in extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances and we believe that its abolition would send a positive message to people,’ he added. Hafiz also said that necessary measures could be taken to enable the police force along with its specialised forces, including the Armed Police Battalion, to carry out the responsibilities of the Rapid Action Battalion. He further said that both local and international human rights organisations, the United Nations, most political parties, and the public blamed the RAB for most of the incidents of enforced disappearances, killings, torture and repression. Hafiz at the briefing also referred to the United States’ sanctioning of the force over allegations of human rights violation. The Rapid Action Battalion was founded on March 26, 2004 during the BNP-led four-party alliance government to curb organised crimes and terrorism. Since its very establishment the force had remained under intense scrutiny, facing serious allegations of human rights violations. The party also gave other reform recommendations, including forming a police commission, to the Police Reform Commission. It has suggested formation of an eight-member Police Commission headed by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs chairman to properly guide, advise and support the police force. One of its recommendations is to form a citizen committee in every upazila or police station jurisdiction to support the police in combating crimes at the local level, improving public-police relations, and giving advice on maintaining law and order. The chair of the committee would be an eminent person of the respective area and the officer-in-charge of the police station concerned would be its member secretary, the BNP suggested as the possible structure of its proposed citizen committees. They also recommended strengthening of community policing, saying that community policing would reduce various crimes and social unrest, help bridge the gap between the police and the public, and increase public awareness. Hafiz further said that after the fall of the Awami League regime on August 5, a total of 488 police officers took shelter at the cantonment who he said were involved with enforced disappearances, killings and corruption. The army did not do the right thing by giving them shelter as they were offenders, the retired serviceman said. Enforced disappearances, killings and repression of the opposition people perpetrated by the Awami regime turned the country into a ‘police state’, he added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252480/bnp-for-rabs-abolition
Sarjis named Jatiya Nagarik Committee chief organiser,"The Jatiya Nagarik Committee, a platform of the youths who played a pivotal role in the student-led mass uprising, announced its extended organisational structure Monday night, appointing Sarjis Alam as chief organiser. Sarjis, general secretary of the July Shaheed Smriti Foundation, was a key coordinator of the students’ movement against discrimination, which spearheaded efforts to oust the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League regime. In the updated structure, Muhammad Nasiruddin Patwary was named convener, Akhter Hossen as member secretary, and Samanta Shermeen as spokesperson, alongside Sarjis as chief organiser. The announcement stated that the restructured committee aims to intensify efforts to abolish fascism and implement a new political settlement inspired by the spirit of the mass uprising. The extended leadership includes Ariful Islam Adeeb, Ali Ahsan Zonaed, Monira Sharmin, Sarwar Tusher, Manzur Al Matin, Tasnim Jara, Atiq Mujahid, and Ashraf Uddin Mahdi as joint conveners.

Nature names Professor Yunus among top 10 personalities in 2024,"Renowned economist and Nobel Laureate professor Muhammad Yunus has been named among the top 10 personalities in 2024 by the scientific journal Nature. The publication described Yunus, now the chief adviser of Bangladesh interim government, as a ‘Nation Builder’ for his impactful contributions to society. The Nature Top 10 list highlights key developments in science over the past year and the people who have driven these advancements. According to its website, the list is curated by Nature’s editors to reflect important trends in science, technology, engineering, and medicine and to recognise people shaping the world. This year’s achievements span a range of remarkable contributions, from redefining weather forecasting to leading a nation. Professor Yunus, born in Chattogram during British-occupied India, witnessed significant geopolitical changes in his early life. After the partition of India in 1947, Chattogram became part of East Pakistan. During the 1960s, Yunus pursued his studies in the United States, where he was mentored by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a pioneer in ecological economics. This field seeks to understand the relationship between economic systems and the natural world. Following the Liberation War of 1971, which led to the birth of Bangladesh, Yunus returned home to contribute to building the newly independent nation. Yunus is widely acclaimed for his pioneering work in microcredit, providing small loans—often less than $100—to empower the underprivileged. While some companies offering small loans have faced criticism for exploiting the poor with exorbitant interest rates, Yunus demonstrated how fair lending practices can transform the lives of the most vulnerable.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252476/nature-names-professor-yunus-among-top-10-personalities-in-2024
"88 cases filed, 70 people arrested in minority-related incidents: CA press wing","The chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam on Tuesday said that a total of 88 cases were filed in connection with sectarian violence that took place between August 5 and October 22 this year. The law enforcement agencies arrested 70 people in connection with these cases relating to communal violence, he said. Shafiqul, while giving the information at a press briefing at the Foreign Service Academy in Dhaka city, said that the updates about such incidents that occurred after October 22 would be given soon. ‘All those involved in these heinous incidents will be arrested; no one will be spared,’ he said. He, however, said that many of these attacks happened due to political affiliation with and holding posts in Awami League ousted from power on August 5 through a mass uprising. ‘Although 88 cases are related to minorities, many of those attacked have been linked with the ousted Awami League,’ he said. ‘However, since cases have been filed and crimes have been committed, we are taking the issues seriously,’ he said, ‘we are taking serious measures for every crime.’ He also said that the number of cases and arrests would likely increase because there were multiple incidents in Sunamganj, Chattogram, Turag area of Dhaka, and Narsingdi after October 22. ‘Only the specific suspects and those against whom allegations have been found are being arrested. No one has been arrested on political identities,’ the press secretary said. About the Rohingya issue, Shafiqul Alam said, ‘We are monitoring the situation very closely and considering the overall Rohingya situation. He said also that the chief adviser appointed a high-ranking representative to closely monitor the situation and talk to all the stakeholders. ‘We will organise a major international conference on the Rohingya crisis next year. We will decide its venue and other things between March and April.’ ‘Hopefully, this conference will be held around September–October in 2025. All the countries in the world will participate in it. Especially those who are highly interested in the Rohingya issue, including the United Nations, European Union, United States, and China,’ he said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252475/88-cases-filed-70-people-arrested-in-minority-related-incidents-ca-press-wing
FIFA to confirm 2030 World Cup hosts and hand Saudi 2034 tournament,"FIFA will confirm the hosts of the 2030 and 2034 World Cups on Wednesday, with a joint bid led by Morocco, Spain and Portugal set to be awarded the former, and the latter being handed to Saudi Arabia. The awarding of hosting rights for both tournaments will go to a vote during a FIFA Congress to be held virtually, but there is no doubt about the outcomes with neither bid having a rival. The 2030 tournament will mark a century since the first World Cup was held in Uruguay, and as a result the bid will also see the South American nation handed a game along with Argentina and Paraguay. That makes it a remarkable and completely unprecedented bid, involving three different continental confederations. FIFA already confirmed over a year ago that the joint proposal led by Morocco, Spain and Portugal was the sole contender for 2030, with all other potential candidacies having fallen by the wayside. A joint British and Irish bid was abandoned when they decided to focus on hosting Euro 2028, while there were suggestions of a bid from South Korea, China, Japan and North Korea. Four South American countries launched a joint bid in 2019, convinced that the centenary World Cup should entirely take place on the same continent where it all began. In late 2022, UEFA promoted a bid uniting Spain and Portugal with war-torn Ukraine in a show of ‘solidarity’ following the Russian invasion. However, Ukraine was quietly dropped from that candidacy last year as Morocco joined forces with the Iberian neighbours, while South America agreed to step aside in exchange for being awarded the hosting of three games, one each for Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina. Following these ‘centenary celebrations’ in the comparative chill of the southern hemisphere winter, the six teams involved -- along with their fans -- will have to cross the Atlantic Ocean to play a part in the remaining 101 matches. This tentacular tournament will conclude with the final on July 21, and it remains to be seen where that game will be staged. Spain, which hosted the 1982 World Cup, is set to be the centrepiece as it boasts 11 of the 20 proposed stadiums. Morocco -- which has tried and failed on five previous occasions to be awarded the staging of the tournament -- will become the second African nation to host the competition after South Africa in 2010. Potential venues for the final include the Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid and Barcelona's renovated Camp Nou, as well as the planned Hassan II stadium between Casablanca and Rabat, which is set to become ‘the biggest stadium in the world’ with a capacity of 115,000. Portugal, which hosted Euro 2004, will offer two stadiums in Lisbon and one in Porto, and hopes to stage a semi-final. As for 2034, FIFA invoked its principle of continental rotation, therefore only welcoming bids from Asia or Oceania -- the 2026 World Cup, the first involving 48 teams, will take place across North America. Controversially, the body gave potential bidders barely a month late last year to submit candidacies, and Australia and Indonesia quickly abandoned their interest. That left Saudi Arabia as the sole candidate, clearing the way for the World Cup to return to the Gulf region following Qatar's hosting in 2022. The kingdom's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been using sport for some time now to amass influence and improve its global image. Being handed the 2034 World Cup will be a crowning moment, and Saudi will win despite currently only boasting two stadiums with a capacity of 40,000, when 14 are required. Beyond that logistical challenge, the baking temperatures in the northern hemisphere summer could mean pushing the tournament back to later in the year, as happened in 2022. However, the fact that Ramadan will take place in December that year is an added complication. Moreover, the awarding of the World Cup to Saudi will make the issue of human rights a major talking point again, just as in 2022. Rights groups highlight mass executions in Saudi Arabia and allegations of torture, as well as restrictions on women under the conservative country's male guardianship system. Free expression is severely restricted too. Saudi Arabia, which is hosting several high-profile events including Formula One and the WTA Finals tennis, is often accused of ‘sportswashing’ -- using sport to divert attention from its rights record.

Retired army officers demand punishment for perpetrators of BDR massacre,"Speakers from ‘Justice for Comrades,’ a platform of retired army officers, have called for the arrest and exemplary punishment of those responsible for various killings, including the killing of 57 army officers during the BDR mutiny, as well as cases of enforced disappearances that occurred under the previous Awami League government. Major, retd, Shakil Newaz made this demand while reading a statement on behalf of the organisation, during a press briefing held at the Dhaka Reporters Unity in Dhaka on Tuesday. The platform also called for the reinstatement of 1,000 armed forces personnel who were dismissed during the past government’s tenure. He also said that a full investigation into the killings of army officers during the 2009 BDR mutiny remains incomplete and the real perpetrators have yet to be brought to justice. Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, the former mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation, filed false cases against some army officers and dismissed them from their job. They were sentenced to different terms in jail, he said. The statement further alleged that several senior officials, including Lieutenant Generals Mamun Khaled, Saif, Abedin and Mujib and Major Generals Ziaul Ahsan and Hamid were masterminds behind the ‘Aynaghar’ incident. It also demanded to make them accountable. Meanwhile, allegations of ‘enforced disappearance’ and killings have been brought against some top officials, including former Inspector General of Police Benazir Ahmed and former DB chief Mohammad Harun-or-Rashid, it said. The platform also demanded that they be arrested and justice ensured.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252473/retired-army-officers-demand-punishment-for-perpetrators-of-bdr-massacre

"Defence research centre, navy ships in Syria destroyed in overnight strikes","A defence ministry research centre in northern Damascus was destroyed and about 10 navy ships were damaged in coastal Latakia in overnight strikes attributed to Israel by a Syria war monitor. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported Monday that ‘Israeli warplanes’ had launched strikes on military targets including ‘the Barzeh scientific research centre’ and naval vessels and army warehouses in and around the Latakia military port. The strikes came on the heels of the collapse of former president Bashar al-Assad’s government over the weekend in the face of a lightning rebel advance. Western countries, including the United States had previously struck the research facility in Barzeh in 2018, saying it was related to Syria’s ‘chemical weapons infrastructure’. On Tuesday, three blocks of buildings that made up the centre were completely destroyed, according to an AFP journalist at the scene, with fire still burning among the ruins. Hundreds of documents were scattered on the ground, some on fire, as a strong smell of explosives lingered in the air. An employee who worked at the centre for 25 years and came to inspect the damage said that ‘the buildings destroyed were not military’. ‘The military centres were destroyed in the past, and the current research was civilian,’ he added, requesting anonymity. A ‘second scientific research centre’, based in Jamraya near Damascus, was also hit by strikes Monday night and ‘totally destroyed’, he said. AFP journalists in Damascus heard heavy strikes overnight into Tuesday morning. In Latakia, smoke was still rising Tuesday morning from the wreckage of navy ships equipped with machine guns and rocket launchers, half-sunk in the water, an AFP correspondent saw. Ahmad Khabaze said civilian employees such as himself had not stopped coming to work at the sea port. ‘Employees are still coming in to take care of state facilities even after the regime fell,’ he told AFP. Another civilian port employee, Samir Alloush, 54, told AFP he heard ‘strange noises in the night that went on for so long’. The region of Latakia was the heartland of Assad’s minority Alawite community, but after the rebel takeover, people there toppled a statue of the deposed dictator’s father. The Observatory reported more than 300 Israeli strikes across the country in the days since Assad fled, saying they had destroyed Syria’s ‘most important military sites’. Israel has conducted hundreds of strikes on Syria since the civil war began in 2011 following Assad’s crackdown on a democracy movement. On Monday, Israel said it had struck ‘remaining chemical weapons or long-range missiles and rockets in order that they will not fall in the hands of extremists’.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252471/defence-research-centre-navy-ships-in-syria-destroyed-in-overnight-strikes
Dhaka residents urged to wear masks outdoors amid worsening air pollution,"The government on Tuesday asked people not to go outside without masks as air quality in Dhaka and elsewhere in Bangladesh deteriorated to an unhealthy and hazardous level. The environment, forest and climate change ministry in its first ever advisory also advised individuals with sensitive health conditions or elderly and children to stay indoors unless absolutely necessary. Environment activists blamed the failure of the authorities concerned to rectify pollution sources for the deterioration of the air quality as Dhaka kept ranking first among the cities with the most polluted air, threatening public health. The Air Quality Index turned so bad that it exceeded the mark of 250 sometimes, the environment ministry said in the advisory when Dhaka’s AQI recorded 241 at 9:00am. The index placed Dhaka as one of the top polluted cities of the world for a long time. Center for Atmospheric Pollution Studies founding director and Stamford University Bangladesh environment science professor Ahmad Kamruzzaman Majumder said that average air pollution in the ountry jumped to AQI 171 in 2023 from 146 in 2017. National Institute of Diseases of the Chest and Hospital director Md Delwar Hossain said that with the rise of air pollution the number of patients and fatalities due to respiratory diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease and asthma, among others, were on the rise. ‘We have no vacant beds now as the 670-bed specialised hospital is flooded with patients with respiratory diseases,’ he told New Age on Tuesday. In 2023, the institute treated 146,469 patients with various respiratory illnesses, with 1,046 fatalities. The figures were 110,774 and 877 respectively in 2000. Several researches revealed the major sources of air pollution in Bangladesh that included construction sites, brick kilns, traffic, burning of solid waste, trans boundary pollution and industrial pollution. Despite knowing the sources, the authority did not take any pragmatic steps to curb the pollution over the years while the sources became intense, increasing pollution, said green activists. The environment ministry said that controlling air pollution was a time-consuming process. It urged all stakeholders to collaborate with the government in controlling air pollution. Department of Environment director for air quality wing Md Ziaul Haque said that controlling air pollution was a multi-stakeholder issue. Local government agencies, industry ministry, transport ministry are among other important entities that need to come forward to stop air pollution for some of the sources, he explained. Officials concerned said that the department conducted several drives against the illegal brick fields and demolished or shut more than 500 brick fields in the past five years. Many of them, however, again went back to production for the lack of monitoring. The authority did not take any punitive actions against the polluters like city corporations responsible for dust pollution from dilapidated roads and construction sites, renovation works and burning solid waste. In 2023, the World Bank published a report titled Striving for Clean Air: Air Pollution and Public Health in South Asia that found that an estimated 30 per cent of pollution in Bangladesh’s largest cities originated in India. To combat transboundary air pollution, four South Asian countries – Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan – agreed on the need to reduce national annual average PM 2.5 levels to 35 micrograms per cubic metre by 2030. The declaration was forged in Nepal in December 2022, during meetings facilitated by the World Bank and the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. None of the countries has, however, taken any pragmatic measures so far. Children and elderly people are more vulnerable to air pollution, said Bangladesh Shishu Hospital and Institute director and professor Mahbubul Hoque. He said that they were receiving an additional number of child patients with respiratory tract infections everyday. The hospital data showed that on average daily 130 patients were admitted to the hospital and another 1,200 patients were given treatment at the outpatient department of the 680-bed hospital. Mahbubul suggested people to avoid pollution as much as possible and to use masks if they need to go outside. The Boston-based Health Effects Institute, in partnership with UNICEF, in a report published in June revealed alarming trends in air quality both in Bangladesh and worldwide, posing significant health risks. According to the latest State of Global Air 2024 report, in 2021 alone, air pollution was responsible for over 2,35,000 deaths in Bangladesh, highlighting a significant public health challenge. The report finds that children under five years are especially vulnerable, with health effects including premature birth, low birth weight, asthma, and lung diseases. In several countries in Africa and in Asia, including Bangladesh, more than 40 per cent of all deaths from lower-respiratory-tract infections in children under five years are attributed to air pollution. In 2021, Bangladesh recorded over 19,000 deaths of children under five years due to air pollution-related conditions. In 2021, exposure to air pollution globally was linked to more than 7,00,000 deaths of children under five years, making it the second-leading risk factor for death globally for this age group, after malnutrition.

Mohammad Abdul Momen new chairman of ACC,"The government on Tuesday appointed senior secretary of the Public Security division of home ministry Mohammad Abdul Momen as new chairman of the Anti-Corruption Commission. The government also appointed retired District and Sessions Judge Mia Mohammad Ali Akbar Azizi and Brigadier General (retd) Hafiz Ahsan Farid as new commissioners of the ACC, according to a gazette notification issued by the Cabinet Division. It said that Momen, as ACC chairman, will enjoy salary, allowances, and status given to an Appellate Division judge, while the two commissioners, as commissioners, will enjoy salary, allowances, and status given to a High Court Division judge. Momen was working on a contract basis in the public  security division of the Ministry of Home Affairs, but he resigned on December 8 from that post to join as ACC chairman, said ministry officials. The Public Administration ministry also on Tuesday issued a separate official order cancelling Momen’s contractual appointment. Momen was sent on compulsory retirement in 2013 by the then Awami League government while he was a joint secretary. After the AL government fell on August 5 amid a student-led mass uprising, he was appointed as secretary of the Public Security Division of the home ministry on contractual basis. Later, he was promoted to senior secretary.

Concerns raised over interviewees for post of BFIU head,"Bangladesh Bank has called ten individuals for interviews to appoint the next head of the Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit. The interviews are scheduled for December 11 and 12. However, the selection process has sparked alarm. According to central bank officials, several individuals shortlisted for the position, including some tied to the S Alam Group during the previous Awami League government, have faced accusations of benefiting from bank irregularities and corruption. They warn that appointing such individuals could undermine the integrity of the financial intelligence body and derail efforts to recover laundered money. Observers have expressed grave concerns, highlighting the significant role of the BFIU in tackling financial crimes. They fear that appointing individuals implicated in corruption or linked to bank fraud could compromise the unit’s credibility. Some critics claim this could jeopardise the recovery of laundered funds and render past sacrifices, including the struggles of students and disabled individuals, meaningless. The ten individuals called for interviews include former Bangladesh Bank executive directors AFM Shahinul Islam, Nazrul Islam, Zahurul Huda, Akhtarul Islam, and Nurul Amin, as well as current executive directors Rafiqul Islam, AKM Ehsan, Mamun Hossain, Md Saiful Islam Khan, and a former deputy managing director of NCC Bank. Among the candidates, Zahurul Huda has attracted particular criticism. After retiring from Bangladesh Bank, Huda reportedly joined the training academy of the S Alam Group. Following S Alam Group’s takeover of National Bank, he was appointed as an independent director of the bank. Sources allege that during their tenure at Bangladesh Bank, some of the shortlisted candidates extended undue concessions to the S Alam Group. In return, they reportedly secured lucrative positions in the conglomerate upon retirement. Critics argue that appointing such individuals to lead the BFIU could lead to the collapse of crucial financial oversight and anti-corruption measures. They call for greater scrutiny and transparency in the selection process to ensure the integrity of Bangladesh’s financial system.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/252468/concerns-raised-over-interviewees-for-post-of-bfiu-head
"Indian players sledged, we hit back: Bangladesh U-19 captain","Bangladesh Under-19 captain Azizul Hakim Tamim believes that aggression and sledging are a part of cricket, and it was necessary against India in the final of the ACC Men's U-19 Asia Cup. The champions of the 2024 edition returned home on Monday night and were received by the Bangladesh Cricket Board officials with bouquets at the airport. The junior Tigers retained the title with an impressive 59-run victory over India in the final at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday. They had claimed their maiden trophy of the tournament last year, defeating hosts UAE by a massive 195 runs in the final at the same venue. 'Indian players sledged, and we gave it back ... To win, you must show some aggression and do some sledging,' Azizul told reporters at the Hazrat Shahjalal Airport on Monday. During the final, a large number of expatriates were cheering for the Bangladesh team, chanting 'Allahu Akbar' from the stands. ‘When they [fans] were saying it, as a Muslim, I liked it. They supported us players a lot; they were in the stands from the morning. Alhamdulillah, it's a great feeling.’ Azizul also shared an incident from the semi-final match against Pakistan, where they secured a seven-wicket victory, which turned out to be quite heated. 'I had missed a free hit. A Pakistani fielder asked me, 'Did you even see the ball?' After that, I hit a six and then asked him, 'Did you see the ball this time?'.' Azizul expressed confidence about carrying the momentum from their Asia Cup victory into the forthcoming ICC U-19 World Cup, scheduled to be held in Zimbabwe and Namibia in 2026. ‘Of course, we have gained confidence from winning the Asia Cup. Beating teams like India and Pakistan also makes you feel confident,’ he said. ‘We will try to hold on to this confidence. We have a few series coming up and then the World Cup. We will try to perform well.’ ",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252467/indian-players-sledged-we-hit-back-bangladesh-u-19-captain-
City Bank announces major salary restructuring to support employees amid inflation,"City Bank has announced a groundbreaking salary restructuring initiative to align with market standards and enhance employee well-being amidst rising inflation. The Board of Directors has approved an annual salary increment of Tk 162 crore for 2024, which will culminate in a total increase of Tk 300 crore by the end of 2025, including PMP adjustments and bonuses. This historic decision will increase the bank’s total salary expenditure to Tk 1,210 crore annually by next year. The initiative follows an in-depth salary survey conducted by Cerebrus Consultants Ltd., comparing City Bank’s compensation packages with those of peer banks. The restructuring is designed to bring salaries closer to market averages while maintaining fairness. Employees whose current salaries are significantly below market standards will receive higher percentage increases, while those closer to market averages will see comparatively smaller increments. From assistant officer to senior executive vice president levels, the salary increments range from 10% to 50%, with an average increase of around 23%. Regardless of current salary levels, a minimum increment of Tk 10,000 has been ensured for all employees, while the maximum increase in some cases has reached Tk 60,000. All Support staff, outsourced staff, contractual employees, and management trainees are also receiving these raises. The new salary structure will take effect on November 1, 2024, with employees receiving the updated amounts in their December payroll, including arrears for November. ‘Our employees are the backbone of CityBank,’ said Aziz Al Kaiser, Chairman of City Bank. ‘By aligning compensation with market standards, we aim to create a workplace where everyone thrives.’ City Bank’s MD & CEO Mashrur Arefin stated, ‘The bank’s profit has increased manifold during my six-year tenure as CEO. Operating profit, which stood at Tk 699 crore, is now even surpassing the Tk 2,000 crore mark this year. It is our moral obligation to ensure our staff can lead comfortable lives with their families during these challenging times.’ This bold initiative underscores City Bank’s vision to foster a sustainable, employee-centric environment, solidifying its reputation as a leading employer in the banking sector.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/252466/city-bank-announces-major-salary-restructuring-to-support-employees-amid-inflation
A World Cup on three continents sparks climate concerns,"The 2030 FIFA World Cup will send dozens of football teams and hordes of fans crisscrossing the globe for matches on three continents, sparking alarm over the environmental cost. An announcement on the 2030 and 2034 World Cups will be made on Wednesday, with expectations of a dramatic expansion of geographic footprint -- and with that planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions. While Saudi Arabia is the lone candidate for 2034, Morocco, Spain and Portugal have formed a joint bid for the 2030 tournament, with Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay each also set to host a match. Guillaume Gouze, of the Centre of Sports Law and Economics at the University of Limoges, said FIFA has a ‘moral responsibility’ to integrate climate concerns into its tournament plans. Instead, he said, it had proposed World Cups that are an ‘ecological aberration’. Benja Faecks of the NGO Carbon Market Watch, which evaluates climate promises of major events, told AFP that in general attempts at greenwashing in sport -- or ‘sportswashing’ -- are harder than they used to be, with academics and campaigners holding organisations to account. But she said that the 2030 tournament was ‘an unfortunate geographic choice’. When an event is spread over sites thousands of kilometres apart, teams and potentially hundreds of thousands of their loyal fans have to travel by plane. The three matches in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay are to mark the 100th anniversary of the event, which was born in Montevideo. FIFA is keen to support access to football across different parts of the world, said David Gogishvili, a researcher at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. But ‘it is a crazy idea in terms of the impact this choice will have on the planet’, he added. FIFA has already expanded participation in the competition, which will see 48 teams take part in the 2026 edition -- held in Mexico, the United States and Canada -- compared to 32 in 2022. This ‘is almost worse than the Cup on three continents,’ says Aurelien Francois, who teaches sports management at the University of Rouen in France. More teams means more fans wanting to visit the venues, more capacity needed in the hotel and catering sector, and more waste, among other issues. FIFA says that, with the exception of the games in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay ‘for 101 games, the tournament will be played in a footprint of neighbouring countries in close geographic proximity and with extensive and well developed transport links and infrastructure’. Meanwhile, oil and gas giant Saudi Aramco became a major sponsor earlier this year in a controversial deal that runs through to 2027. In October, an open letter from more than a hundred female professional footballers across 24 countries called for the deal to be cancelled on the grounds of human rights and environmental concerns, saying: ‘FIFA might as well pour oil on the pitch and set it alight’. Just shrinking the geographic footprint is not enough, researchers said. While the 2022 World Cup was held in a ‘compact’ site in Qatar, it was necessary to build new air-conditioned stadiums that were rarely reused. Potential improvements could include a policy of not awarding the World Cup to a city where everything has yet to be built, echoing a rule by the International Olympic Committee, said Gogishvili. Another idea to reduce air travel is to reserve a large proportion of stadium tickets for fans travelling from within a few hundred kilometres, and encourage transport by train. Gouze, like other experts interviewed by AFP, supports creating more fan zones in soccer-loving cities for ‘a collective experience’ that recreates the stadium atmosphere in front of a big screen. But this would need FIFA to accept the impact on the economic profitability of the World Cup. Soccer fans are a reflection of the population as a whole, so a growing percentage are more environmentally conscious than even a few years ago, said Ronan Evain of Hamburg-based Football Supporters Europe. He said that while co-hosting is not a problem in and of itself, citing the example of the 2002 Cup co-hosted by Japan and South Korea, the 2030 tournament poses ‘too many questions’ for fans. These include the environmental costs, as well as financial considerations for fans trying to follow their teams across the planet. But die-hard supporters will not let the long-haul flight put them off, said Antoine Miche, director of Football Ecologie France. ‘Passion can make you do things that don't make sense,’ he added.

Appellate Division stays HC order declaring Joy Bangla as nat’l slogan,"The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed a High Court verdict, which had paved the way for the Awami League government to declare Joy  Bangla as the national slogan on March 2, 2022. The High Court verdict was delivered on March 10, 2020. A four-member bench of the apex court, chaired by chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, also granted the government permission to appeal against the High Court decision. The stay order came after hearing a petition filed by the cabinet secretary, who sought leave to appeal and requested a suspension of the High Court’s judgment. The petition followed the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League government amid a student-led mass uprising on August 5. Additional attorney general Aneek R Haque, representing the state, argued that determining a national slogan was a policy matter under the jurisdiction of the government, and the High Court overstepped its authority by issuing a directive on such a matter. Speaking to journalists after the hearing, Aneek said, ‘Joy Bangla can no longer be recognised as the national slogan.’ The High Court verdict was pronounced by the bench of Justice KM Kamrul Kader and Justice Khizir Hayat on March 10, 2020, in response to a writ petition filed by Supreme Court lawyer Bashir Ahmed. In his petition, Bashir had contended that Joy Bangla was the slogan predominantly used during the nine-month War of Independence in 1971.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252461/appellate-division-stays-hc-order-declaring-joy-bangla-as-natl-slogan
Victory day to be celebrated through nationwide fairs: Farooq-e-Azam,"Bangladesh’s victory day will be celebrated this time with nationwide victory fairs instead of the traditional parade at the National Parade Square, says liberation war affairs adviser Farooq-e-Azam. ‘Victory day is an unparalleled day for our nation...the nation achieved this victory after nine months of war, with people from all over the country participating in the struggle,’ Farooq-e-Azam said in an interview with UNB. Highlighting the new plan and format, the adviser said that Victory Day celebrations had historically been vibrant community events. ‘Once, this victory festival was celebrated in villages across the country. Over time, these celebrations became less active. This year, we are reviving the festival at the district and upazila levels nationwide,’ he explained. ‘The Victory Fairs will feature art and craft exhibits, agricultural product displays, and showcases of domestic goods. Cultural programmes will include the participation of children, women, and men, making the celebration inclusive for all,’ Farooq-e-Azam said. Schools will also host their own programs as part of the festivities, he said. For the first time in recent memory, the traditional parade at the National Parade Square will not be held. Explaining this change, Farooq-e-Azam said, ‘The army is currently engaged in activities across the country, and organising the parade requires advance preparation, which wasn’t feasible this year.’ When asked if the chief adviser would participate in this year’s celebrations, he clarified, ‘No, the chief adviser will not attend the parade because it is not happening this year. Instead, Victory Fairs will be organised at the district and upazila levels.’ Special receptions and tributes for freedom fighters will be organised in every district and upazila, including Dhaka, under the local administration’s guidance. ‘Freedom fighters and people from all local levels will participate actively in these events,’ Farooq-e-Azam said. The Dhaka district administration will play a key role in organising activities in the capital. Meanwhile, the chief adviser and the president will lay wreaths at the National Monument as part of the day’s commemorations. On December 14, the chief adviser and the president will visit the National Intellectuals’ Graveyard, where a solemn tribute will be paid to the martyrs. They will also participate in a discussion at Rayer Bazar. ‘The shift in celebration format aims to bring more active public involvement and create a festive atmosphere in every part of the country,’ Farooq-e-Azam concluded. ‘This year’s events are designed to reflect the spirit of Victory Day and engage citizens from all walks of life,’ he added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252460/victory-day-to-be-celebrated-through-nationwide-fairs-farooq-e-azam

Bangladesh tightens border amid influx fear as Arakan Army seizes Maungdaw,"Bangladesh has beefed up security measures along its border with Myanmar as fighting rebel group Arakan Army on Sunday captured the remaining base of the Border Guard Police in the Rakhaine state. Authorities concerned said that the latest development in Myanmar would further worsen the risk of a fresh Rohingya influx in Bangladesh. On Sunday, Arakan Army, which one of the most powerful ethnic minority armed groups battling the Myanmar army, claimed the capture of the last outpost of the country’s border force in the strategic western town of Maungdaw, gaining full control of the 271-kilometre (168-mile) -long border with Bangladesh, United News of Bangladesh reported. Officials of the local administration and law enforcement agencies told New Age on Tuesday that they were on high alert along the land border and the River Naf to check trespassing, influx in particular, of Myanmar citizens. Refugee Relief and Repatriation commissioner Mohammed Mizanur Rahman stationed in Cox’s Bazar said that the Arakan Army had already shifted a huge number of Rohingyas from Buthidaung locality of Arakan to Maungdaw. ‘We have heard that around 2,00,000 Rohingyas have assembled along the Myanmar side of the border. They are struggling with food shortages. So there is potential risks of an influx in Bangladesh,’ Mizanur said. The RRR commissioner has also requested law enforcement agencies to step up their surveillance along the border area. Major Syed Istiaque Murshed, acting commanding officer at Teknaf Battalion  (2 BGB) under the Border Guard Bangladesh’s Ramu Sector, said on Tuesday evening that the Arakan Army took over the whole land area across the Naf River. ‘We are on alert and doing our best to stop Rohingya influx and illegal drug trafficking,’ Istiaque told New Age in a written message, adding that the BGB personnel were carrying out ‘domination patrol’ over the Naf River on Sunday night. The Border Guard Bangladesh conducted boat patrols from Border Reference Marker (BRM)-6 to BRM-10, covering vulnerable spots along the Naf River and asserting control over islands within Bangladesh’s territorial waters, said a press release issued by the force on Monday. The Bangladesh Coast Guard also joined hands to intensify the border security. The force’s East Zone media officer Lieutenant Shakil told New Age on Tuesday that the Coast Guard’s two outposts on the River Naf increased patrols to stop trespassers through the waterway. ‘Additionally, we have sharpened our surveillance and intelligence,’ Shakil said. As part of beefing up border security, the Teknaf upazila administration imposed a temporary ban on all kinds of transportation through the Naf River from Sunday afternoon for an indefinite period.  The ban also covered fishing in the Bangladesh part of the river, upazila nirbahi officer SK Ahsan Uddin said on Tuesday afternoon. ‘Since Sunday evening, we have not heard the sounds of fire shots and bombing which became usual for the past one month,’ Ahsan said. On Monday, the Associated Press quoted Khaing Thukha, a spokesperson for the Arakan Army, saying that the Arakan Army seized the last remaining military outpost in Maungdaw on Sunday. An unverified press release of the Arakan Army also declared an indefinite ban on all transport of people and goods in the Myanmar side of the Naf River from Sunday afternoon. The release said that the members of the ‘fascist’ Myanmar military junta along with their allies, including armed groups Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, Rohingya Solidarity Organisation, Arakan Rohingya Army, were trying to flee through the Naf River. ‘Therefore, due to military necessities and public security concerns, all river transportation in the Naf River (Rakhine side) will be indefinitely suspended starting from 3:30pm on December 8, 2024,’ the unverified release said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252457/bangladesh-tightens-border-amid-influx-fear-as-arakan-army-seizes-maungdaw
Dhaka continues to be world’s most polluted city with AQI score of 241,"Dhaka has again topped the list of cities around the world with the worst air quality on Tuesday morning. With an air quality index score of 241 at about 9:00am, Dhaka ranked first in the list of cities with the most polluted air. An AQI between 151 and 200 is said to be ‘unhealthy’ while 201 and 300 is considered ‘very unhealthy’, and 301 to 400 is considered ‘hazardous’, posing serious health risks to residents. Pakistan’s Lahore, Vietnam’s Hanoi, and India’s Delhi occupied the second, third and fourth places with AQI of 219, 194 and 191 respectively. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants — Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2 and Ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon. As per the World Health Organisation, air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/environment-climate-change/252456/dhaka-continues-to-be-worlds-most-polluted-city-with-aqi-score-of-241
Trudeau survives third no-confidence vote,"Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau’s government on Monday survived a third vote of no confidence in as many months, brought by his main Tory rival. The minority Liberal government got the support of the New Democratic Party, a small leftist faction once aligned with the ruling Liberals, to defeat the motion 180-152. The text of the proposition echoed NDP leader Jagmeet Singh’s own past criticisms of Trudeau since breaking off their partnership in late August, calling him ‘too weak, too selfish.’ Neither Singh nor Trudeau were present for the vote. The House of Commons has been deadlocked most of this fall session by an unprecedented two-month filibuster by the Conservatives. But speaker Greg Fergus, in a rare move, ordered a short break in the deadlock to allow for this and other possible confidence votes, and for lawmakers to vote on a key spending measure. Lawmakers are scheduled to vote Tuesday on the spending package, which includes funds for social services, disaster relief and support for Ukraine. With a 20-point lead in polls, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has been itching for an election call since the NDP tore up its coalition agreement with the Liberals. The NDP and other opposition parties, whose support is needed to bring down the Liberals, however, have so far refused to side with the Conservatives. Two no-confidence votes brought by the Tories in September and October failed when the NDP and the separatist Bloc Quebecois backed the Liberals. In Canada’s Westminster parliamentary system, a ruling party must hold the confidence of the House of Commons, which means maintaining support from a majority of members. The Liberals currently have 153 seats, versus 119 for the Conservatives, 33 for the Bloc Quebecois, and 25 for the NDP. Trudeau swept to power in 2015 and has managed to hold on through two elections in 2019 and 2021. ",https://www.newagebd.net/post/world/252455/trudeau-survives-third-no-confidence-vote
"ACC, judiciary turned into slaves of Hasina: Asif Nazrul","Law adviser Professor Asif Nazrul on Monday said that Sheikh Hasina turned the Anti-Corruption Commission and the judiciary into her slaves during the Awami League rule in the country. The ACC and judiciary failed to ensure justice and accountability in most cases, he said as chief guest while addressing a discussion arranged by ACC at the Institutions of Diploma Engineers, Bangladesh, in Dhaka marking International Anti-Corruption Day 2024. Asif said, ‘There was an ACC, there was a High Court, but there were no trials except for Khaleda Zia, and the corruption became entrenched in society due to the lack of accountability.’ Mentioning that Sheikh Hasina and her entire family were 'thieves,' Asif Nazrul said that ‘No one could speak in front of that 'thief' (Hasina). The ACC and the judiciary had become her slaves. Now there is no interference.’ Expressing frustration about corruption, he said the corruption had become an ‘accepted norm’ in the society. ‘No one asks, where has so much money come from?’ Asif said, ‘We used to hear peoples saying at places about the names of the cashiers of Sheikh Hasina, Rehana, and Salman, through whom does Joy gets money, whose money does Palak (former state minister of ICT) keep.’ He said, ‘There was the ACC, there was also the High Court, but no trial took place except Khaleda Zia. She kept Tk 3 crore in a bank; no one embezzled or touched a single penny from there, but the ACC and the judiciary jointly sentenced the three-time former prime minister to 10 years in prison only for a procedural error.’ Referring to a controversial statement by the former prime minister, he said, ‘How does a prime minister's peon claim to own Tk 400 crore and laugh about it during a press conference? The entire family was complicit in corruption. During Sheikh Hasina’s tenure, the ACC and judiciary became her subservient.’ Asif said that the ACC commissioners, before resigning, had approved inquiries against hundreds of ministers and businessmen who stole and became owners of thousands of crores of taka in the past. ‘Now you conduct the inquiry and prove that you can work if you get a good environment. This is our and the entire country’s desire from you.’ He emphasised the need for immediate reform and activation of the ACC to address previous corruption effectively. ‘We cannot leave the ACC dormant. The new commission must be empowered to tackle corruption effectively,’ he added. ‘We must stop blaming only politicians and take responsibility for our own actions. Learning from the youth and fostering a culture of accountability are essential,’ he added. ACC secretary Khorsheda Yasmeen presided over the discussion. The discussion also underscored the necessity of reform within the ACC and judiciary to ensure their independence and efficiency.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252454/acc-judiciary-turned-into-slaves-of-hasina-asif-nazrul
BBS begins economic census 2024 today,"The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics on Monday at a press conference announced that it would begin Bangladesh Economic Census 2024 today across the country to gain a detailed perception about the structural changes in the country’s economy.

Student movement leaders’ vehicle attacked by muggers,"A microbus carrying eight leaders of the Student Movement Against Discrimination was allegedly attacked by muggers on the Dhaka-Chattogram Highway in Narayanganj’s Sonargaon upazila early Monday, police said. Based on the nature of the attack and initial accounts, it is suspected to be a mugging incident, said Mohammad Abdul Bari, officer-in-charge of the Sonargaon police station. He said that police detained one person in connection with the incident. ‘A patrol team was present near the spot, and as soon as our patrol team rushed there, the muggers ran away. Efforts are on to identify and apprehend all the attackers,’ he added. One of the victims, Mahmuda Sultana Rimi, the central executive committee member of the platform, said that a group of individuals wearing masks stopped the vehicle when traffic slowed on the highway. ‘The attackers broke windows of the microbus and looted mobile phones and wallets from us before fleeing,’ she said. The incident took place at about 2:00am in Narayanganj as eight student leaders were traveling to Bandarban’s Lama for attending an event, she said, adding that at least three leaders, including she, suffered minor injuries from broken glasses during the attack. ‘There were other vehicles at the time but the attackers surprisingly attacked only ours,’ she added.

Mass uprising leaves 55pc children traumatised: study,"Ever since the July-August student-led mass uprising, 55 per cent primary schoolchildren have been living in a state of fear struggling with serious mental health consequences, according to a study revealed on Monday in the capital. The Campaign for Popular Education and BRAC Institute of Educational Development conducted the study between September and November across the country to observe children’s mental health state. The perception study was conducted collecting opinion from 203 organisations working on education, 12 focus group discussions among 260 people, two divisional and two national-level conferences attended by nearly 600 people and opinions from 30 resource persons. Street protests, rallies, violence, arson, vandalism, gunfire, curfew, and fellows being killed and wounded brought deep impact on their mental health, according to the study. Among other findings, 36.5 per cent children struggle to put attention to their studies, 37 per cent observed not willing to attend school, and 8 per cent observed struggling to control their temper. Primary and mass education ministry adviser and psychiatrist Professor Bidhan Ranjan Roy Podder said that students’ mental health issue remained largely ignored. Speakers urged the adviser to take initiatives to provide playgrounds and boost cultural and sports activities programmes, and happy learning environment to overcome the mental trauma and create an atmosphere for mental health to thrive. Bidhan Ranjan said that it was not possible to build new playgrounds in schools in the capital but the government would reclaim all the playgrounds and parks illegally grabbed and would take steps to prevent further grabbing. The government would appoint fine arts teachers in schools and would reconstruct school buildings based on aesthetic designs. Saying that prevailing exam system put excessive pressure on students, the speakers also pointed out that measures should be taken to provide mid-day meals for student and make education materials entertaining. CAMPE executive director Rasheda K Choudhury said that an initiative for flexible academic calendar was taken in 2008 to enable the schools to take more inclusive decisions based on the situation in a specific area. As an example, she said that students from the national minorities in the Chittagong Hill Tracts did not need Ramadan leave as they were mostly non-Muslims, but they needed leave during the cultivation season to give their families a hand with their farming activities.

Major Myanmar rebel group sends delegation to China for talks,"A major Myanmar ethnic rebel group has sent a delegation to China for talks with its government, its spokesman said on Monday, as Beijing looks to end fighting along its southern border. A delegation from the Kachin Independence Army had left on Sunday ‘for talks with the Chinese government’ at China’s invitation, Colonel Naw Bu said. He did not give details on what the talks would be about or where they were being held. China is the most important ally of the junta that seized power in Myanmar in 2021 but also maintains ties with several ethnic rebel groups that hold territory just over its border. The past year has seen increased clashes between some of those groups and the junta across northern Myanmar, a vital link in Beijing’s trillion-dollar Belt and Road initiative. KIA fighters were battling junta troops in the town of Bhamo on Monday, Naw Bu said. ‘They the Myanmar military used a lot of air strikes and artillery attacks to protect their bases,’ he said. The KIA, which can call on around 7,000 fighters, has been battling the military for decades for autonomy and control of local resources in Kachin state. The state is home to huge jade mines and rare heavy earth elements, most of which are exported to China. In recent weeks two other Myanmar rebel groups in neighbouring Shan state said they were ready for China-brokered peace talks with the junta. China has welcomed the moves, which analysts say came after Beijing pressured the groups to halt operations against the junta. Myanmar is home to about a dozen ethnic rebel groups that have battled the military for decades for autonomy and control of lucrative resources including jade, timber and opium. Some, including the KIA, Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and Ta’ang National Liberation Army, have given shelter and training to newer ‘People’s Defence Forces’ that sprang up to battle the military after it seized power in 2021.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/252449/major-myanmar-rebel-group-sends-delegation-to-china-for-talks

Cold diseases hit children hard as winter begins,"Cold related illness like fever, sneezing, cough, neck pain and asthma has been increasing among the children as the winter begins. Physicians said that the children and the elderly people are the easy targets of the diseases because the age groups of people have comparatively low immunity. They said that flu is highly contagious and it spreads from one family member to another and the patient develops the symptoms of general cold and fever along with pneumonia, asthma, bronchitis and even diarrhoea. They prescribed the guardians to keep their children under extra care during this time of season change. Bangladesh Shishu Hospital and Institute director Professor Mahbubul Hoque said that that they were receiving additional number of child patient everyday who was infected by cold related viral diseases. ‘Children ages bellow five years are more vulnerable to cold related diseases,’ he said. He said that cold with polluted air also causing many allergy problems. He asked the guardians not to expose children to cold or polluted air. If needed, children should be worn mask and provided additional care. He estimated that the number of patients at the specialised hospital for children was growing 10 per cent more than usual time. The hospital data showed that some daily average of 130 patients were admitted to the hospital and another 1,200 patients were given out-door healthcare in the 680-bed hospital. BSMMU paediatrics Professor Suraiya Begum said that a large number of children were coming to receives healthcare after being affected by fever, sneezing, cough, neck pain and asthma. Sometimes the cold turned to pneumonia which could be life threatening. She said that due to favourable temperature and humidity, the virus could spread easily and affect children since they were vulnerable. Ashraful Islam, a private job holder went to the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital from Mohammadpur on Sunday to visit a doctor with his daughter Arifa Jannat, 5. Ashraful said that, for the past eight days, his daughter had been suffering from fever. He visited a local clinic where no disease was diagnosed. ‘We are worried. My daughter has been suffering from fever for the past 10 days but we are not sure what types of fever is it,’ he said. He said that not only his daughter but also daughters of his relatives were also affected by fever or other cold related diseases. Rabiya Afroz, mother of Alifa Akter, 6, went to the Bangladesh Shishu Hospital and Institute as her daughter has been suffering from cold that turned into pneumonia.

Commission to investigate extrajudicial killings demanded,"Rights organisation Ain O Salish Kendra on Monday demanded formation of a commission to investigate all the incidents of extrajudicial killing reported till now. The demand was part of a statement released by the rights body containing 15 demands. The rights body made the statement marking International Human Rights Day, globally celebrated on December 10 every year. The theme of International Human Rights Day 2024 is ‘Our Rights, Our Future, Right Now.’ According to ASK human rights monthly reports, nine people fell victims to extrajudicial killings from August 9 to November 30 after the Professor Muhammad Yunus-led interim government assumed power on August 8. ASK reports revealed that one person turned victim of extrajudicial killing in November while three people died in October for the same reason. Of the nine, five died due to physical torture by the joint forces, one died under torture by members of the Department of Narcotics Control, one died due to torture by the members of Bangladesh Navy and two died in shootouts by police and joint forces between August 9 and November 30, according to the ASK monthly reports. According to a report by human rights organisation Odhikar published on November 15, at least eight incidents of extrajudicial killings were reported from August 9 to September 30. ASK’s 15-point demand included ensuring necessary action to prevent mob lynching incidents, changing discriminatory laws to ensure equal rights for women, ensuring safety for the religious and national minorities, reforming the National Human Rights Commission Act of 2009, and taking necessary steps to implement Chittagong Hill Tracts Treaty.

Begum Rokeya Day observed with call for women’s equality,"Begum Rokeya Day was observed on Monday across the country with a call for ensuring equality of women in every sector. The country marks December 9 as Begum Rokeya Day commemorating birth and death anniversaries of Begum Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain on the same day. Begum Rokeya, considered as a pioneer of women renaissance in the subcontinent, was a Bengali writer, thinker, educationist, social activist, and advocate of women’s rights. Recalling contribution of Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain, popularly known as Begum Rokeya, to social reform, chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus said that her works and thoughts surprised him. He made the remark while distributing Begum Rokeya Padak-2024 to the recipients at a ceremony at Osmani Memorial Auditorium in the city on Monday.   Amid the hard time, Rokeya emerged as a courageous girl and lady, the chief adviser said. The chief adviser also proposed introduction of ‘Sultanar Swapna (dream) Award’. Describing Begum Rokeya as the precursor of the women renaissance, Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting chairman Tarique Rahman said that the life, works and ideals of Begum Rokeya would inspire immensely the womenfolk to become self-reliant. ‘Begum Rokeya inspired women to become self-reliant in the family, society and economy,’ he said in a message marking the Begum Rokeya Day 2024. Different women rights bodies, social and cultural organisations, observed the day paying rich tributes to the celebrated personality who was born on December 9, 1880, in the village of Pairaband of Mithapukur in Rangpur. To mark the day, the Ministry of Children and Women Affairs organised a programme. The government introduced the award in 1995 after the name of Begum Rokeya, a pioneer of women’s liberation movement in the undivided Bengal who was a leading feminist writer and social worker during the early 20th century and mostly famous for her efforts for gender equality and female education. The Dhaka north city unit of the Communist Party of Bangladesh organised a discussion at party’s central office to mark the day. Bangladesh Nari Mukti Sangsad also held a discussion at the Workers Party of Bangladesh central office to mark the day.

South Korea bars president from leaving country,"South Korea’s president Yoon Suk Yeol was banned from leaving the country on Monday, the justice ministry said, less than a week after he plunged the country into chaos by briefly imposing martial law. Yoon sent special forces and helicopters to parliament on the night of December 3 before lawmakers forced him to rescind the order by rejecting his decree. The hugely unpopular leader narrowly survived an impeachment motion in parliament on Saturday even as huge crowds braved freezing temperatures to call for his ouster. However, despite remaining in office, a clutch of investigations has been closing in on Yoon and his close allies, including a probe for alleged insurrection. The ministry of justice confirmed on Monday that Yoon had become the first sitting South Korean president to be banned from leaving the country. A lawmaker was asked at a parliamentary hearing on Monday whether Yoon had been banned from leaving the country. ‘Yes, that’s right,’ Bae Sang-up, an immigration services commissioner at the ministry, replied. Also under travel bans for their roles in last week’s events are former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun — currently in detention — and ex-interior minister Lee Sang-min. General Park An-su, the officer in charge of the martial law operation, and defence counterintelligence commander Yeo In-hyung are also barred from leaving the country. Investigators hauled Park in for further questioning on Monday. The impeachment push failed to pass after members of Yoon’s own People Power Party walked out of parliament, depriving it of the necessary two-thirds majority. The PPP says that in exchange Yoon, 63, has agreed to hand power to the prime minister and party chief, prompting howls of protest from the opposition. ‘This is an unlawful, unconstitutional act of a second insurrection and a second coup,’ Democratic Party floor leader Park Chan-dae said on Monday. Under South Korea’s constitution, the president remains head of government and commander in chief of the army unless he or she is incapacitated, resigns or steps down. In such a case, power would then be handed to the prime minister on an interim basis until elections could be held. Claiming that Yoon can remain in office but has delegated his powers to the prime minister and leader of his ruling PPP — who is not an elected official — is ‘a blatant constitutional violation with no legal basis’, Park said. ‘Their attitude of placing themselves above the constitution mirrors that of insurrectionist Yoon Suk Yeol,’ he said. The defence ministry confirmed on Monday that the embattled Yoon remained at the head of the country’s security apparatus, despite the apparent power vacuum in a country that remains technically at war with nuclear-armed North Korea. ‘Legally, control of military forces currently lies with the commander in chief,’ defence ministry spokesperson Jeon Ha-kyou said. Yoon has apologised for ‘anxiety and inconvenience’ caused by his declaration of martial law but has not stepped down, saying instead he would entrust decisions about his fate to his party. He also said he would accept all political and legal responsibility for the martial law fiasco. There is no constitutional basis supporting the ruling party’s claim that Yoon can stay in office but hand over his power to unelected party officials, said Kim Hae-won, a constitutional law professor at Pusan National University Law School. ‘It seems to resemble an unconstitutional soft coup,’ he said. ‘If there are issues with the president, there are ways laid out in the constitution such as suspending the president from his duties, and then move on to proceedings set out in the constitution, such as impeachment,’ he said. The opposition has already said they would try again to impeach Yoon, with leader Lee Jae-myung saying another vote would be held on Saturday. Huge crowds are expected to gather again outside the National Assembly building. Yoon’s approval rating hit 11 per cent, a historic low for the unpopular president, according to a new Gallup poll commissioned by local media.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/252438/south-korea-bars-president-from-leaving-country
PSC review on cards after offshore gas exploration bid attracts none,"State-owned oil company Petrobangla is considering reviewing the production sharing contract as it failed to attract any international companies in the bidding floated to explore offshore gas. Monday was the last day for the submission of bidding documents. The submission time was extended by three months in September, after the incumbent interim government assumed power. ‘We will try to find out by a special committee the reasons behind the disinterest,’ said Zanendra Nath Sarker, chairman, Petrobangla. Recommendations will be made based on the finding whether the PSC particularly was not attractive enough, he said. He said that the change in political landscape could leave international oil companies undecided about engaging in exploratory activities. Seven companies had procured tender documents after the tender was floated in March. The oil companies were US-based companies Exxon Mobil and Chevron, Thailand-based PTTEP, Singapore-based Chris Energy, India-based ONGC, Japan-based Inpex, and China-based CNOOC International Limited. After floating tender, Bangladesh had urged global companies to participate, saying that they offered one of the world’s most lucrative deals. Energy experts had also agreed with the government about the Production Sharing Contract of 2023 being too profitable for private investors, offering many concessions and tax holidays. The PSC sought minimum bank guarantee and allows transfer of shares. Investors could also bid for one or more blocks alone or with other companies under the PSC. The bidding covered Bangladesh’s all 24 offshore blocks, including the nine in the shallow water. The shallow blocks are 3m to 200m deep while the deep sea blocks are ranging from 201m to 2000m deep. The PSC linked the gas price to oil price, meaning that the earlier provision of any cap on the price was removed. For ensuring a faster return on investment, the PSC offered 75 per cent cost recovery. The investors would not have to pay any royalty either unlike in other countries such as neighboring Myanmar and Thailand. The UK-based Wood Mackenzie, a multinational research and consultancy group, made the recommendations based on which the 2023 model PSC was updated. Bangladesh has so far held seven biddings since 1974 for gas and oil exploration, with the highest number of foreign companies entering production sharing contracts in 1974. Bangladesh has drilled 97 wells, finding gas in 29 wells. Bangladesh’s current production capacity is about 2100mmcfd against a demand of about 5000mmcfd. After a prolonged period of inactivity over exploration, the government passed the 2023 PSC in the election year, months before it assumed power for the fourth straight term. American oil giant ExxonMobil had reportedly expressed its interest in exploration in all offshore blocks in Bangladesh. An enormous gas exploration potential opened up between 2012 and 2014 after Bangladesh won over 20,000sq km in the Bay of Bengal following the settlement of maritime disputes with India and Myanmar. Immediately after losing its maritime dispute with Bangladesh, Myanmar awarded 20 offshore blocks, mostly in the Rakhine basin off the Arakan coast, south of Teknaf, to international oil companies by 2014. Of 26 open offshore blocks, Bangladesh has PSC for two shallow sea blocks — blocks SS-04 and SS-09, which ONGC Videsh Ltd and Oil India Ltd are jointly exploring.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252437/psc-review-on-cards-after-offshore-gas-exploration-bid-attracts-none

Mugging incidents on rise in Dhaka: DMP chief,"Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Sheikh Sajjat Ali said on Monday that incidents of mugging and robbery were reported to be on the rise in the capital. Detective Branch and local police have been instructed to remain vigilant to tackle these crimes, he said at a press briefing at DMP media centre on Minto Road in the capital. He also said that ‘trade’ was being done as far as cases related to deaths in the July-August mass uprising were concerned. He also said that action had been taken against a police officer in the Mohammadpur area on Sunday for allegedly being involved in such an incident. ‘Individuals should only be brought to book if evidence links them to the incident,’ he added. ‘It will be difficult to stop extortion if the people do not resist it. Please do not pay such ‘toll’. We, the police, will stand by the people’s side,’ he said. The commissioner also claimed that more than 80,000 of the around two lakh police members were recruited based on their political affiliations in the past 15 year. ‘In the past 15 years, various forms of scrutiny were done during appointments to determine the political affiliations of the candidates, as well as those of their fathers, grandfathers, and even ancestors,’ As a result, 80,000 to 90,000 of the two lakh police members were recruited through this process, he said, adding, ‘We cannot simply ask 80,000 to 90,000 police personnel to leave.’ He apologised to the residents of Dhaka and the people of the country for DMP’s unprofessional conduct during the July-August quota reform student movement. The commissioner said that actions were taken against responsible officials over the DMP’s unprofessional actions at that time.

Climate change poses major threat to Bangladesh’s apparel earnings,"Bangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan, and Vietnam — four major apparel producers — could face a 22 per cent decline in nominal earnings by 2030 and 68 per cent by 2050 if the countries fail to invest in climate adaptation, according to a new study revealed on Monday. These losses could result in nearly one million forgone jobs by 2030 and up to eight million by 2050, underscoring the urgent need for mitigation efforts, report says. The study titled ‘Hot Air: How will fashion adapt to accelerating climate change?’ highlights the urgent need for these countries to implement adaptation strategies to safeguard their industries from the escalating impacts of climate change. High heat stress days have surged by 42 per cent across five major garment production hubs including Dhaka, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Phnom Penh, and Karachi over the last 20 years, with the frequency of extreme heat events rising alarmingly, according to the study. Bangladesh’s lack of meaningful workplace heat standards contrasts with stricter regulations in countries like Vietnam and Malaysia, creating compliance risks for international brands under the European Union’s corporate accountability laws, it says. These gaps in standards not only threaten worker wellbeing but also pose significant operational and reputational risks for the global apparel sector. The findings highlight an urgent need for Bangladesh to implement robust climate adaptation strategies, enforce meaningful workplace standards, and strengthen social protection mechanisms to safeguard workers and sustain its apparel industry in the face of escalating climate threats. The report also says Bangladesh's low purchasing power for manufacturing wages and limited social protection coverage exacerbated its climate vulnerability. These weaknesses leave workers ill-equipped to cope with lost income and rising living costs driven by climate events. Indoor heat risks also remain unaddressed in Bangladesh although the Accord on Fire and Building Safety introduced critical safety measures after the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013. The Labour Act of 2006 mandates ‘adequate ventilation’ and ‘comfortable’ temperatures but lacks enforceable thresholds or specific requirements, leaving workers exposed to extreme heat conditions. According to the report, in Bangladesh, compliance with indoor 'comfort' standards is certified by unregulated third parties. While the Accord on Fire and Building Safety, established in 2013 after the Rana Plaza disaster that claimed over 1,100 lives, oversees safety and health, it excludes indoor heat regulations from its scope, a gap also present in its successor organization, the RSC. Regarding Bangladesh, the study also says the devastating floods of July and August 2024 have compounded the industry’s vulnerabilities. Widespread inundation caused significant production delays in garment factories and disrupted operations at the Chattogram port, a vital link in global supply chains. The cumulative impact of these floods has reduced apparel output, adding strain to an industry already grappling with political instability and economic pressures. Researchers warn that these climate risks are widespread, with 23 production centres reporting significant increases in high-heat days. This threshold, which accounts for heat and humidity, marks the point at which the International Labour Organisation (ILO) advises garment workers to alternate equally between rest and work to maintain safe core body temperatures. Researchers also report an increase in the intensity of heavy rainfall over the last two decades, further compounding climate-related risks. Heat stress and flooding pose severe challenges to apparel production, affecting workers’ health, slowing production, and even causing the shutdown of factories, transportation, and ports. Previous research by Cornell ILR and Schroders estimates that four key apparel-producing nations could lose up to $65 billion in export earnings by 2030 due to extreme heat and flooding. The impacts are already being felt. In April, heatwaves in Bangladesh forced school closures and led to lower productivity and increased sick days among garment workers. In August, Vietnam grappled with deadly floods and landslides that disrupted education and delayed the start of the school year. The findings underline the urgent need for adaptation measures and robust social protection systems to shield workers from these escalating climate threats. Researchers also warn that under emerging Due Diligence laws, brands could face legal liabilities for harm caused to workers by extreme climate events. Jason Judd, executive director of Cornell University’s Global Labor Institute, emphasised that extreme heat and flooding pose significant health risks for millions of garment workers and represent material threats to the fashion industry. He highlighted the urgent need for adaptation investments to protect workers and supply chains, stressing that these efforts must complement de-carbonisation initiatives. Judd also underscored the importance of pairing physical adaptation measures with robust social investments, noting that one without the other would be ineffective. He pointed to living wages as a critical example, enabling workers to manage lost workdays and rising costs associated with electricity, food, and climate-related medical expenses. Judd called for clear and enforceable climate-labour requirements across the industry, encompassing employers, brands, investors, and lenders. ‘These are needed for the industry to adapt to climate breakdown and for major brands and retailers to meet their obligations to workers under new CSDDD rules,’ Judd added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/apparel/252434/climate-change-poses-major-threat-to-bangladeshs-apparel-earnings
AL crony keeps raking in abnormal profit,"One of the Awami League cronies, who made it to the recently published White Paper on economy for raking in abnormal profit, continues to do so with its business monopoly as a commercial independent power producer, while paying less for years for the gas it uses in its plants. The United Power Generation and Distribution Company Limited that owns two commercial independent power plants, which are the only power plants of this kind in the country, has refused to pay for years the legitimate price for the gas it uses for power generation. Years of paying less since January 2018 has led to the piling up of the company’s dues to the state-owned Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Ltd to Tk 486 crore by October 2024, eight months after the Appellate Division had ruled against it holding back the payment. The company commercially producing power was not supposed to receive the gas in the first place, considering the 2008 policy to enhance private sector participation in the power sector, amidst rapidly depleting gas reserve and staggering energy crisis. The story of how the company, which fetched, almost without failing, 50–74 per cent annual profits over the last decade, used the scarce national resource for commercial purpose is a telltale sign of Awami League’s brazen favouritism, according to energy experts. The United Power that purchased gas for Tk 988 crore between 2017–18 and 2023–24, earned Tk 3,799 crore from electricity sale. ‘The United has refused to pay legitimate price for rather a long time. Its gas supply should be disconnected,’ said Shahnewaz Parvez, managing director, Titas. But business monopoly stood in the way, he said, reminding that the United Power was the only company supplying electricity in the Dhaka and Chattogram export processing zones. The power plants, with installed capacity of 164MW, were established with Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority’s approval in 2008 and 2009, just around the time Awami League assumed power. The two plants’ establishment cost was over Tk 1,005 crore. Energy experts explain that a commercial power plant is essentially different from other power producers such as independent power producers, given that the government takes no risk and responsibility for the commercial one, leaving its construction and business to be operated on its own. Independent power producers, also known as IPPs, on the other hand, enjoy privileges from government, such as, guaranteed fuel supply and electricity sale. The government buys electricity from all the IPPs in the country. The ‘Policy guidelines for enhancement of private participation in the power sector, 2008’ states that commercial power plants’ investors will have to arrange their own fuel and energy. The policy, however, also allows commercial power plants to obtain licence as an independent power producer. But such a licence, known as COIPP, combining two types of power plants, was awarded only to one company: United Power. The White Paper released by the interim government cites United Power as a member of Awami League’s favoured groups that received special terms. The company receives gas at the IPP rate of Tk 15.75 per meter cube instead of the captive rate of Tk 30.75 per meter cube, the paper says. ‘…selling power at the commercial rate to the Dhaka and Chittagong EPZ, thus raking in abnormal profit,’ reads a line of the White Paper. A year before the United Power obtained the licence in October 2009, it had signed a deal with the Titas for purchasing gas at the captive rate for its Dhaka EPZ power plant. The captive rate for purchasing gas, applicable to captive and commercial power plants, has always been higher than the IPP rate. In 2009, the difference in gas prices for the IPP and captive was Tk 1.12 per unit, which is Tk 15 at the moment. The United Power started paying the IPP rate after obtaining the licence and continued to do so until August, 2022, when the High Court ruled that the company must pay separate rates—the captive rate for electricity sold commercially and the IPP rate for electricity sold to the government. The High Court order came following a legal battle triggered by Titas asking for separate rates in 2019. The United Power’s outstanding bills resulting from paying less stood at Tk 377 crore in 2022 when the High Court ordered in favour of the Titas to charge separate rates. In December 2022, the United Power agreed to pay back the dues in 40 instalments, only one of which—Tk 30 crore—has so far been paid. But after the company had started paying the separate rates from August 2022, it stopped paying higher heating value which is obligatory under the contract when the supplied fuel produces heat higher than contracted. Fuels with higher heating value yields more production. The United Power had tried to have the High Court order reviewed by the Appellate Division, but its petition was discharged in February this year. Still, the company did not clear its dues. ‘The bill the company paid was barely half of what it had owed,’ said Hasan Mehedi, member secretary of Bangladesh Working Group on Ecology and Development, analysing data obtained from the Titas. How much the United Power owed to the Karnaphuli Gas Distribution Company Limited is unknown. The working group’s analysis also revealed that 23 per cent of the power produced between 2017–18 and 2023–24 was supplied to the national grid, while the rest went as a commercial supply to the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority. Last year, the United Power declared 20 per cent profit. Its profit stood at 74 per cent in 2018, followed by similar profits made in 2016 and 2017. In the other years, since 2013, the company reported 50 per cent or more profit. Neither the Bangladesh Power Development Board nor Titas or Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission officials have any idea about the rates at which the United Power sells power commercially. BERC officials recalled the pressure under which they issued the COIPP licence to the United power. There are seven other commercial power plants, all holding COPP licence, which is awarded exclusively for commercial power production, despite desperate attempts to have it changed to COIPP. The United Power has been lobbying for some time now for a COIPP licence for its third commercial power plant, Leviathan Global Bd Ltd, a 53MW power station under construction at Karnaphuli EPZ. ‘The United Power is enjoying absolute monopoly in business,’ said energy expert Mohammad Tamim, who was a member of the committee that prepared the White Paper on the state of economy made public on December 2. The United Power did not have to look back after its venture of the two COIPP power plants made eye-watering profits. Since 2011, the United Power set up seven more power plants—all IPPs—with installed generation capacity of 1,041MW. United Power’s company secretary Elias Howladar told New Age that he did not have any comments about any of the matters.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/power-energy/252433/al-crony-keeps-raking-in-abnormal-profit
EU countries urged to shift visa centres from Delhi,"Chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus on Monday urged the European Union to relocate its visa centres for Bangladeshis from Delhi to Dhaka or to any other neighbouring country. He made the call when a 19-member EU delegation, led by Michael Miller, head of the Delegation of the European Union to Bangladesh, met him at the Chief Adviser›s Office in Tejgaon in Dhaka. The European Union, on the other hand, observed huge foreign direct investment potential in Bangladesh, leading to a tentative schedule of starting a discussion on the matter of ease of doing business in Bangladesh in January, according to an EU statement shared on the verified page of European Union in Bangladesh. The EU also recalled its offer to boost smart, secure, and open links via the Global Gateway strategy and mentioned the January 2025 visit of the vice-president of the European Investment Bank, said the EU statement. According to a chief adviser office statement, the chief adviser told the EU delegation that as India has restricted visas for Bangladeshis, many students are unable to go to Delhi to get visas for EU countries. As a result, he said, uncertainty has arisen about their educational careers, while universities in Europe are not getting Bangladeshi students. ‘If the visa office is shifted to Dhaka or any neighbouring country, both Bangladesh and the European Union will benefit,’ he added. As many as 15 EU diplomats expressed their views in the two-and-a-half-hour meeting. Paying tribute to the martyrs and injured in the July-August uprising, Yunus briefly outlined the oppression, exploitation, enforced disappearances, and human rights violations over the past 16 years during the Awami League regime in the country. Stating that misinformation is being spread against Bangladesh on a large scale, Yunus also sought the EU’s cooperation to fight the misinformation. Yunus also informed that dictator Sheikh Hasina and her aides, who were forced to flee the country in the July uprising, are trying to destabilise the country with the huge amount of money they laundered. During the meeting, foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain informed EU representatives that Bulgaria has already shifted its visa centre for Bangladeshis to Indonesia and Vietnam. He urged other countries to follow the same process. The EU representatives expressed their full support to the chief adviser in the reform process and vowed to stand by him in the aim of building a new Bangladesh by providing advice and recommendations, said the chief adviser›s media wing release. EU participants underlined their readiness to help Bangladesh achieve a successful and inclusive transition, underpinned by human rights, the rule of law, and good governance, leading to democratic elections. The EU confirmed that it will use its resources to help Bangladesh deliver in line with the expectations of its citizens. The EU recognised the key role of Bangladesh for hosting more than a million Rohingya refugees. After the meeting, environment, forest, and climate change adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan told journalists, ‘we asked about getting trade benefits from the EU in their market so that Bangladesh can graduate from the Least Developed Country status. ‘We have talked about climate change and solving the Rohingya problem,’ she said while briefing journalists at the gate of the chief adviser›s state guest house Jamuna in Dhaka. The envoys who participated in the meeting are: Christian Brix Moller, Ambassador of Denmark to Bangladesh; Marie Masdupuy, Ambassador of France to Bangladesh; Achim Tr»ster, Ambassador of Germany to Bangladesh; Antonio Alessandro, Ambassador of Italy to Bangladesh; Gabriel Sistiaga Ochoa de Chinchetru, Ambassador of Spain to Bangladesh; Nicholas Weeks, Ambassador of Sweden to Bangladesh; Michael Miller, Ambassador and Head of the EU Delegation to Bangladesh; Andre Carstens, CDA a.i., Embassy of the Netherlands in Dhaka.

Air pollution: a call for action,"EVERY breath we take should sustain life, yet for millions in Bangladesh, especially in Dhaka, each breath comes with an invisible threat — air pollution. This silent crisis has woven itself into the fabric of daily life, quietly taking its toll on health, the environment, and livelihoods. Dhaka, the bustling heart of Bangladesh, has become a stark symbol of this growing catastrophe, consistently ranking among the most polluted cities in the world. On December 5, Dhaka recorded an alarming air pollution score of 341, classified as ‘hazardous.’ The situation only marginally improved on the following day, with the city topping the global air pollution list yet again, recording a score of 248, deemed ‘very unhealthy.’ This grim reality peaked on December 4, 2023, when Dhaka’s AQI soared to 259, maintaining its position as the most polluted city globally. Even earlier, on December 3, Dhaka ranked 7th, with an AQI score of 184, falling into the ‘unhealthy’ category. The situation worsens each year during the dry season, when pollution levels spike dramatically. These numbers are not just data points; they represent an unfolding crisis impacting millions, especially the most vulnerable — children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing conditions. In Bangladesh, air quality is measured through the Air Quality Index, which monitors five critical pollutants: particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, and ozone. An AQI score of 151–200 is considered ‘unhealthy,’ 201–300 is ‘very unhealthy,’ and anything above 300 is categorised as ‘hazardous,’ posing severe health risks to millions of residents. This is more than a story of numbers; it is a call to action. Dhaka’s air quality tells a tale of neglect, rapid urbanisation, and unchecked pollution, demanding immediate and sustainable solutions. The question is, how much longer can we hold our breath?  Growing air pollution crisis BANGLADESH has faced chronic air pollution problems for years, and the situation seems to be worsening. According to the IQ Air Report for 2023, Bangladesh has ranked number one globally for air pollution, followed by Pakistan, India, Tajikistan, and Burkina Faso. The average AQI score in Dhaka has risen from 150 in 2016 to 171 in 2023, demonstrating the intensifying nature of the issue. The impact of this air pollution is not just environmental but also health-related. A report by the World Bank highlights that exposure to high levels of air pollution significantly raises the risks of respiratory issues, lower respiratory tract infections, and mental health problems such as depression. Children under five, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions like diabetes or respiratory illnesses are most vulnerable. In 2019 alone, air pollution in Bangladesh caused between 78,145 and 88,229 premature deaths, according to the World Bank report.  Regional comparison and government responses IN COMPARISON to Dhaka, other cities in South Asia also grapple with unhealthy air quality levels. As of December 4, Delhi’s AQI stood at 172 (unhealthy), while Islamabad’s AQI was 158 (unhealthy), both better than Dhaka’s level. In response to the growing pollution crisis, authorities in Punjab, Pakistan, have launched nearly 200 mobile clinics and increased hospital beds to help residents combat air pollution-related illnesses. Additionally, Pakistan has developed a National Clean Air Plan to address emissions from sectors such as oil and gas, agriculture, and waste management. India, through its National Clean Air Programme, has set specific goals to improve air quality, particularly in 132 cities where air pollution standards are not met. The World Bank is supporting India’s air quality management efforts by providing expertise and financing. India’s focus on reducing emissions, transitioning to renewable energy, promoting electric vehicles, and supplying cleaner cooking fuels to households has played a significant role in addressing the issue.  Root causes of air pollution in Dhaka DHAKA’S severe air pollution can be attributed to several key factors: Construction activities: Year-round construction, including roads and buildings, alongside large-scale projects like metro rail and expressways, significantly contributes to the pollution. While environmental guidelines exist, they are rarely followed, and enforcement by authorities is weak. Brick kilns and factories: Around 1,200 brick kilns near Dhaka, many of which use outdated, polluting methods, contribute significantly to air pollution, emitting pollutants such as carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide. Similarly, factories are responsible for over 50 per cent of air pollution in the region. Unfit vehicles: A substantial portion of Dhaka’s buses (about 70 per cent) are unfit for operation and emit harmful pollutants. Regulatory bodies have failed to phase out these vehicles despite their negative impact on air quality. Waste burning: Both official and private waste burning add to the pollution. Methane emissions from landfills and local waste burning exacerbate the already deteriorating air quality. Cross-border pollution: Air pollution from neighbouring India, especially during the winter months, exacerbates the pollution crisis in Dhaka. Stubble burning and industrial emissions from states like Delhi and Haryana further worsen air quality. Low rainfall: Below-average rainfall during the dry season limits the natural cleansing effect of rain, leaving pollutants like particulate matter suspended in the air for longer periods.  Health and environmental impact EXPOSURE to air pollution has far-reaching consequences for public health. In addition to respiratory problems, studies show that air pollution contributes to a range of diseases, including asthma, bronchitis, lung cancer, and cardiovascular conditions. The World Bank Report notes that exposure to poor air quality is linked to premature deaths and rising healthcare costs. The life expectancy of Bangladeshis has also been adversely affected by poor air quality. In 2019, air pollution caused significant loss of life, and its effects are particularly felt during the dry season when pollution levels rise dramatically. The health risks of air pollution are not confined to physical ailments. Mental health conditions like depression have also been linked to prolonged exposure to polluted air, adding a layer of complexity to the issue.  Global perspective and solutions GLOBALLY, air pollution remains one of the leading causes of premature death. According to the World Health Organisation, more than 90 per cent of people in low- and middle-income countries are exposed to unsafe levels of air pollution. Air pollution in these regions tends to be more severe than in developed countries due to limited technology, resources, and infrastructure to combat it. Asia, in particular, has seen a significant rise in air pollution, with regions like East and Southeast Asia suffering from high levels of particulate matter and ground-level ozone. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ground-level ozone are particularly harmful to human health, as they can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, leading to heart disease, lung cancer, and other fatal diseases. However, the United Nations Environment Programme believes that the problem is solvable with the right strategies and commitment. Dechen Tsering, the UNEP regional director for Asia and the Pacific, has emphasised that reducing air pollution is not impossible; solutions are available, but they require urgent and coordinated action from governments, industries, and individuals alike.  Solutions to combat air pollution THE fight against air pollution requires a multi-pronged approach: Stricter regulations: Governments must enforce stricter environmental regulations, particularly for industries, construction activities, and transportation. This includes monitoring and controlling emissions from brick kilns, factories, and unfit vehicles. Renewable energy: Transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower will significantly reduce emissions from coal and oil-based power generation. Cleaner transport: Promoting electric vehicles, improving public transportation systems, and encouraging cycling and walking in cities can reduce vehicle emissions. Better waste management: Investing in proper waste management and recycling systems can reduce the need for waste burning, one of the major contributors to air pollution. Cross-border cooperation: Countries in South Asia should collaborate to address cross-border pollution, such as controlling stubble burning in India, which exacerbates pollution in neighbouring countries like Bangladesh. Public awareness and education: Public awareness campaigns are essential to educate citizens about the dangers of air pollution and the steps they can take to reduce their personal contribution, such as using public transportation, reducing waste, and conserving energy. Individual responsibility: While government action is essential, individuals must also play a part in tackling air pollution. This includes making sustainable choices, such as reducing personal car usage, conserving energy, and supporting clean energy initiatives. The air pollution crisis in Dhaka and other cities across South Asia is a serious public health threat that requires urgent and sustained action. Governments, industries, and individuals must come together to combat this issue through stricter regulations, cleaner technologies, and better waste management. At the same time, the public must be educated and empowered to make choices that protect both their health and the environment. Only through a collective effort can we hope to reduce air pollution, improve public health, and mitigate the impacts of climate change. The time to act is now, and every step we take today will contribute to a cleaner, healthier future.

Lessons from Syria’s struggle for freedom,"THE question of who ousted Bashar al-Assad has dominated countless headlines, debates and think tank discussions. Yet, for the millions of Syrians whose lives have been shaped — and shattered — by decades of brutal governance, this question is a distraction. The real focus should be on the human cost of oppression, the erasure of freedoms and the desperation of a people whose basic rights have been systematically stripped away. For over half a century, Syria endured the iron-fisted rule of the Assad regime. Under the guise of stability and anti-imperialism, the government presided over an era marked by fear, repression and relentless state violence. Disappearances, extrajudicial killings and a deeply entrenched culture of corruption within intelligence agencies became the norm. Syrians lived in a society where dissent was met with imprisonment, torture, or death. In such an environment, the natural human yearning for freedom and dignity transcends political ideology or religious affiliation. People suffering under such oppressive conditions do not concern themselves with the geopolitical machinations of foreign powers. They seek an escape from tyranny. They seek justice. They seek a life where they are free to speak, assemble and dream without fear of reprisal.  Legacy of tyranny THE Assad regime’s oppressive reach was not confined to Syria’s borders. For decades, it extended into Lebanon, controlling parts of the country, particularly the north, with an iron grip. For residents of Tripoli, the presence of Assad’s forces was a daily reminder of their vulnerability. Checkpoints dotted the roads, serving not as symbols of security but as instruments of terror. Travellers recount harrowing tales of random beatings and detentions, their fate decided by the mood of soldiers. Fishermen returning from long days at sea were forced to surrender their best catch and farmers transporting produce from the mountains were compelled to hand over portions of their cargo at every stop. This exploitation turned livelihoods into a daily struggle for survival. The regime’s cruelty escalated during the 1980s when it waged war on Tripoli twice. In 1983, Assad’s forces attacked the city to root out Yasir Arafat and the PLO. The shelling was relentless, reducing homes and infrastructure to rubble. Families sought refuge in schools and countless lives were lost. Three years later, in 1986, the regime returned, this time targeting the Islamic group Tawheed, which had once been its ally. Tripoli endured another round of indiscriminate bombardment. Even after the fighting subsided, the regime violated peace agreements, systematically hunting down those who had dared to resist. Families were left to mourn loved ones executed in cold blood or lost to the black hole of Syrian prisons. The regime’s tactics were not limited to warfare. Car bombs in crowded streets caused unspeakable carnage, killing scores of innocent civilians. One Tripoli resident recalled losing several family members to these acts of terror. This legacy of violence and repression left scars that would haunt generations.  Syrian civil war: a tragedy of unimaginable scale THE horrors inflicted on Tripoli pale in comparison to what Syria has endured since the uprising of 2011. The Assad regime responded to peaceful protests with brutal force, plunging the country into a civil war that has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced. Entire cities have been reduced to rubble and the humanitarian crisis has reached staggering proportions. The international response has been a patchwork of competing interests and half-hearted interventions. Foreign powers, each with their own agendas, have exploited the chaos. While some entered under the banner of fighting extremism or promoting stability, their involvement often exacerbated the suffering of the Syrian people. Geopolitical conspiracy theories abound, suggesting that foreign powers such as the United States, Türkiye, or Israel orchestrated the removal of Assad to serve their strategic interests. While these narratives dominate discourse, they miss the point. The root of Syria’s tragedy lies in the decades-long oppression that created the conditions for such chaos.  The path forward THE enduring lesson from Syria is clear: tyranny creates a void that foreign powers are all too willing to exploit. When a government denies its people justice, freedom and avenues for peaceful dissent, it paves the way for external intervention. The only true defence against such exploitation is a government rooted in the will of its people — a government that is accountable, transparent and democratic. True sovereignty does not lie in merely repelling foreign influence. It lies in empowering citizens to shape their own destiny. A government chosen through free and fair elections disarms external actors by denying them the chaos and disenfranchisement they thrive upon.  Resilience of the Syrian people THE Syrian people have endured unimaginable suffering. Yet, their resilience and yearning for freedom remain a beacon of hope. Their stories — of survival, resistance and unwavering hope — deserve to be told and honoured. As the world looks at Syria, let us not be distracted by conspiracy theories or geopolitical blame games. Instead, let us focus on the human cost of tyranny and work towards a future where the voices of Syrians are heard, their rights respected and their dignity restored. The struggle for a free and just Syria is not just a regional issue; it is a universal call to uphold the principles of human rights, democracy and justice. Let this be the foundation upon which a new Syria rises — one that embodies the aspirations of its people and stands as a testament to their resilience and courage.  A shared struggle for freedom THE Syrian people’s relentless pursuit of freedom and justice echoes across borders, resonating with countless others who yearn for similar liberation. The recent uprising in Bangladesh, a nation that has historically championed democratic ideals, serves as a stark reminder of the global struggle against authoritarianism. Just as the Syrian people have endured decades of oppression, the citizens of Bangladesh have confronted their own share of challenges. Both nations have witnessed the erosion of democratic norms, the suppression of dissent and the misuse of state power. The parallels between these two struggles are undeniable, highlighting the universality of the human desire for liberty and dignity. As the world watches these unfolding events, it is crucial to recognise the interconnectedness of these struggles. The Syrian people’s unwavering spirit and the Bangladeshi people’s pursuit of a democratic future inspire us all to stand in solidarity with those who fight for a better world. By amplifying their voices and supporting their causes, we can contribute to a future where justice, freedom and human rights prevail.

Overtourism in Cox’s Bazar,"BANGLADESH is exceedingly proud of Cox’s Bazar, a tourist gem known for its longest uninterrupted sea beach with golden sands and turquoise waters. However, a brewing ecological and socio-economic crisis is below the surface of its attraction. A hot spot for millions of annual holidaymakers, the region is having to confront one aspect of overtourism, which has pushed its finely poised ecosystems and infrastructures over the edge. Although the tourism industry enhances economic development and creates jobs and infrastructure, the unchecked influx of visitors has negative consequences. Environmental degradation tops the list, where beaches are littered with rubbish, coral reefs marred by pollution, and forests destroyed to make way for things like tourism facilities. Overcrowded roads, failed waste management, and stressed water resources only aggravate the ordeal of infrastructure. In addition, the overconsumption of natural capital, including water and fisheries stocks, erodes local livelihoods. The result has been a boon for many, but the tourism boom is increasingly seen as double-edged.  Environmental costs of popularity The tourism boom has been both a blessing and a curse for Cox’s Bazar. On the one hand, it supports the local economy, bringing revenue to hotels and restaurants, transportation services, etc. On the other, it leaves an environmental disaster in its wake. The impact is visible: plastic waste litters its beaches, and oil pollution smothers the coral reefs. Forests are pulled down to make way for new hotels, while garbage pours out of local management systems. Traffic congestion in peak and off-peak seasons also doubles the woes for locals and tourists.  Communities caught in the crossfire THE human impact of overtourism must be considered. Local communities are paying the price. The region risks becoming a spectator sport as more developers and enablers try to commercialise the ecological magic here rather than preserve it. Traditions, too, fall to the wayside and are commercialised for tourist tastes, further waning some of the most colourful cultural heritage that strengthens this region. Meanwhile, excessive pressures on natural resources — from water to fish stocks — reduce the ability of many communities to make a living. Furthermore, natural resource depletion, such as water to fish stocks, is also damaging local livelihoods. While the booming tourism industry is a blessing for some, it has become a curse for many.  Finding a way forward AMID the crisis, there is hope. Government, business, and civil society stakeholders must unite for sustainable tourism. A concerted approach is a dire need of the time where Cox’s Bazar Development Authority could take the lead role in coordinating with the government and business community for immediate interventions as follows: The government should implement tough tourism regulations to regulate the number of visitors, restrict the construction of large-scale resorts or hotels in sensitive areas, and manage tourist activities to reduce environmental damage. It should enforce zoning laws that safeguard natural areas from overdevelopment and guarantee sustainable land use. To mitigate tourism’s environmental impact, the government should prioritise sustainable and eco-friendly infrastructure projects, including renewable energy sources, waste management systems, and water conservation initiatives. Public transport networks to mitigate traffic congestion and carbon emissions from private vehicles should be considered as well. The community should be involved in tourism planning and decision-making. This may encompass stakeholder engagement in developing tourism policy, public consultations, and community-based tourism initiatives. To foster local entrepreneurship by offering small businesses financial assistance and training programmes should be made available for locals. In this manner, the revenue from the tourism industry will remain within the community. It is important to establish a tourism management body to monitor visitor numbers, evaluate tourism’s environmental and community impact, and suggest policies as necessary. A system for visitor registration or a tourist tax to regulate the flow of visitors and generate revenue for environmental conservation and community development can also be introduced. It is important to earmark protected areas and marine reserves to protect critical ecosystems and prevent tourism activities from damaging them. There should be educational campaigns to encourage visitors to respect local culture and reduce environmental impact, thereby promoting responsible tourism practices. The government should encourage businesses to implement corporate social responsibility initiatives that prioritise environmental sustainability and community development. This could encompass supporting environmental initiatives, healthcare, or education in the local area. The public-private partnership is needed to foster sustainable tourism practices and provide support for community-driven initiatives by collaborating with the government and local NGOs. The businesses, such as hotels, resorts, and restaurants, should also be encouraged to adopt sustainable practices, such as reducing plastic use, recycling waste, and sourcing local products to minimise environmental impact. Business entities should promote the development of eco-tourism and cultural tourism experiences that generate employment opportunities for local artisans/tour guides and benefit the local community. Business should establish partnerships with concerned government organisations, local businesses, civil societies, labour organisations, international development agencies, community organisations, and local NGOs to establish a unified approach to tourism management and safeguard the ecosystem. This can assist in aligning business objectives with community interests and foster a sense of shared responsibility. They should encourage the advancement of community-based tourism initiatives that empower local communities and offer alternative income sources.  The clock is ticking COX’S Bazar is not a mere district but symbolises Bangladesh’s natural and cultural heritage. If overtourism continues unchecked, those things that make it special will be lost, too. Nonetheless, swift action and a unified approach can only conserve its ecosystem. Visitors, locals, businesses, and policymakers must shoulder some of these responsibilities for safeguarding the pristine environmental diversity of Cox’s Bazar. Indeed, we cannot let this national gem become the parable of ‘neglect and greed.’  Dr Md Mosleh Uddin Sadeque is a development practitioner working as an adviser at the Integrated Development Foundation and a native of Cox’s Bazar.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/opinion/252405/overtourism-in-coxs-bazar
India’s responsibility to curb transnational fake news,"In the aftermath of the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh, there has been a tsunami of fake news circulating in Indian mainstream media outlets and among social media users, targeting internal matters in Bangladesh. Given the transboundary nature of this fake news and its implications for Bangladesh-India bilateral relations, it was expected that India would take appropriate measures to curb its spread. However, India’s failure to address this issue became remarkably obvious after the attack on the Agartala Bangladeshi Mission. This incident highlights the urgent need to counter the rise of fake news to maintain the good neighbourliness between these two nations, traditionally viewed as friendly neighbours. India has reportedly garnered a global reputation for being a significant source of fake news. The 2024 Global Risks Report by the World Economic Forum designates India as the nation most vulnerable to the pervasive threats of misinformation and disinformation. The propagation of fake news targeting Bangladesh is not new in India but has reached an unprecedented height since the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina regime. Despite relentless efforts by fact-checkers from both Bangladesh and abroad, Indian media outlets have not altered their approach to the circulation of fake news. The fake news emanating from India primarily focuses on minority-related issues, Bangladesh’s interim government, its foreign policy, its political system and even Bangladesh-India relations. Alarmingly, prominent Indian media outlets appear to have joined this campaign alongside obscure media platforms. It does not come as a surprise that political leaders and rightist groups in India are buying the fake news, leading to deteriorating India-Bangladesh relations. The recent incidents at the Bangladeshi diplomatic missions in Kolkata and Agartala might be viewed as a by-product of the tensions that have been exacerbated by the widespread circulation of fake news, especially those related to the arrest of the expelled former ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das. While the interim government is struggling to restore the rule of law and economic stability following a 15-year authoritarian regime marred by unprecedented financial irregularities, the spread of fake news from India poses significant security and governance threats to Bangladesh. While no direct evidence links the Indian government to this surge, its inaction — coupled with ongoing support for the ousted Sheikh Hasina, who is allegedly using her refuge in India to destabilise Bangladesh despite facing an arrest warrant for crimes against humanity — suggests implicit endorsement of these media campaigns. The transboundary nature of the fake news campaign raises questions about India’s legal obligation to curb its spread under international law. Although transnational fake news is not a new phenomenon, international law remains largely underdeveloped in this area. Two international treaties — the 1936 International Convention on the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace and the 1953 Convention on the International Right of Correction — address fake news but lack widespread ratification. Unfortunately, neither Bangladesh nor India is a party to these treaties, leaving them ineffective in the current context. In such cases, the principle of non-intervention, a norm of customary international law that is binding on all the states, offers some guidance. This principle prohibits states from engaging in acts of intervention, whether direct or indirect, in the internal affairs of another state. It is increasingly accepted that the dissemination of transnational fake news is being recognised as a potential act of coercion that may qualify as an intervention under this principle. The 1981 UNGA Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States, voted positively by both Bangladesh and India, reinforces this position. It mandates states to abstain from defamatory campaigns or hostile propaganda intended to interfere in another state’s internal affairs. While this UN Declaration was initially championed by global south nations, its principles are increasingly gaining traction among global north states in the face of the threat of transnational fake news. The key question now is whether the circulation of fake news can be attributed to the Indian government. While private Indian media outlets are primarily responsible for disseminating fake news, their activities appear to align with and indirectly advance the broader geopolitical interests of the Indian government. Politically speaking, an unstable Bangladesh serves the interests of Sheikh Hasina, the Awami League and potentially the Indian government, which may, as has been seen by many political commentators, favour the political rehabilitation of the Awami League in Bangladesh. This may partly explain the Indian government’s inaction in curbing the circulation of transnational fake news. Furthermore, since Indian private media outlets operate under regulatory frameworks controlled by the Indian government, India had the full capacity to regulate or minimise the circulation of fake news from the very beginning. Its apparent persistent inaction in this regard amounts to a deliberate omission, falling short of its due diligence obligations and constituting indirect interference in Bangladesh’s domestic affairs. In other words, India’s omission to regulate fake news is indirect interference in Bangladesh’s domestic affairs. At this juncture, the key concern is whether regulating fake news would infringe on freedom of expression. However, this right is subject to reasonable restrictions under both international and Indian law. Article 19 of the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights permits restrictions on free expression to protect the rights or reputations of others, national security, public order, or public health or morals. Article 20 further prohibits propaganda for war and incitement to national, racial or religious hatred. It indicates that the Indian government could reasonably control and prevent the circulation of transnational fake news. Doing so would also fulfil India’s responsibility to protect the rights of individuals affected by such fake news. Furthermore, the Indian constitution similarly allows for restrictions on the freedom of expression under Article 19. It includes grounds such as the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of court, defamation, or incitement to an offence. Thus, the Indian government is not legally barred from addressing transnational fake news. On the contrary, its inaction may violate its constitutional obligations to ‘maintain just and honourable relations between nations,’ as outlined in Article 51 of the Indian constitution. It is now imperative for the Indian government to constrain the circulation of fake news. It is not only affecting the internal matters of Bangladesh but also overshadowing actual news that may require proper attention. India must admit that its fake news propagation is affecting its bilateral relations with Bangladesh. To remedy the already damaged image of the Indian government, there is no alternative but to immediately regulate transnational fake news while acknowledging the new realities facing the country. The sooner India accepts this reality, the better it will be for both countries. It would not be surprising that the international community would disregard the genuine news related to the Indian interests in Bangladesh, taking lessons from the fable of ‘The Shepherd and the Tiger’. India should also accept the fact that its fake news propagation is actually affecting its bilateral relations with Bangladesh. In order to remedy the already damaged image of the Indian government in Bangladesh, there is no alternative but to immediately regulate transnational fake news while acknowledging the new realities facing the country. The sooner India accepts this reality, the better it will be for both countries.

"Govt, BCB should do more than basking in U-19 Asia Cup glory","THE Bangladesh Under-19 cricket team retaining the ACC U-19 Asia Cup title with a crushing 59-run win over India in the final on December 8 is, indeed, a feat to relish. The junior Tigers earlier claimed the 2023 title, their maiden title of this tournament, when they defeated host UAE by 195 runs. After being invited to bat first, the junior Tigers faced challenges with the early departure of the openers, which left the side at 41-2, but middle-order batters helped them set a moderate total of 198 in 49.1 overs. It was for bowlers to defend such a modest total against India, a team with a strong batting order, and what the bowlers did was a joy to watch. Pacers Al Fahad and Maruf Mridha made early inroads by dismissing the Indian openers, while pacer Iqbal Hasan Emon’s 3 for 24, including two consecutive wickets in the 20th over that proved crucial in determining the fate of the game, and skipper Azizul Haque Tamim’s 3 for 8 made India succumb to 139 in 35.2 overs. Earlier, Bangladesh had beaten Pakistan by seven wickets in the first semi-final in Dubai on December 6. The win of the Under-19 team sounds a heartening note and the team deserves a roaring ovation. This shows that the junior Tigers can do wonders if they are afforded the needed fillip. The U-19 team earlier also did impressively in international tournaments, including winning the ICC Under-19 World Cup in 2020. In fact, the Under-19 team appears to have fared better than the national team. What, however, comes as worrying is that the Under-19 team does not receive the support it requires to flourish. As a result, most of the promising young stars fall through the cracks and just fade away from cricket. When the young players do not receive the perks and benefits that members of the Under-19 team in other countries receive, they also do not have the opportunity to play as many domestic matches as are necessary for a proper flourishing. Members of the team and experts have long demanded that the Bangladesh Cricket Board take care of the young players round the year and play them in domestic tournaments such as the Bangladesh Cricket League, National Cricket League, Dhaka Premier League and others. The young players also suffer from a lack of infrastructure, especially proper grounds and cricket academies. Moreover, the existing cricket grounds, academies and tournaments are largely Dhaka-centric, which restricts a wider young cricketers’ pool. While this is heartening that the junior Tigers have once again proved their mettle, the cricket authorities should not rest on the laurels that the under-19 team has earned for the country. The Bangladesh Cricket Board should attend to the problems that young cricketers generally face. The cricket board should put in more efforts to nourish the young cricketers.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/252402/govt-bcb-should-do-more-than-basking-in-u-19-asia-cup-glory
Timely call to Meta to contain disinformation on Bangladesh,"The constant flow of purposefully crafted, misleading, or totally fabricated information that mimics the form of mainstream news has been a growing global concern, and it became particularly disconcerting for Bangladesh following the fall of the Awami League regime on August 5, when a section of communally oriented media outlets and many groups affiliated with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s Hindu nationalist government spread fake news, particularly concerning the minority affairs in Bangladesh. Rumour Scanner, an independent fact-checking platform in Bangladesh and signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network, has identified 49 India-based media outlets that has spread fake news on Bangladesh from August 12 to December 5. The spread of fake news in this case incited communal violence and appeared as an attempt at creating political instability in Bangladesh. In this context, the chief adviser rightly appealed to the director of human rights of Meta on December 7, the parent company of Facebook, to contain the disinformation campaign against Bangladesh. The kind of control Meta wields over online public information requires that it takes urgent action to combat disinformation and, as the chief adviser said, plays the role of protecting the right to reliable information. Considering the risk of inciting communal violence, especially after the incident at the court premises following the arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das, spokesperson of Sanatan Jagaran Mancha and a former leader of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness on specific charges of sedition and the killing of a lawyer and the attack on Bangladesh’s assistant high commission in Agartala by an affiliate of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, the government should consider decisive steps to make Meta play its part. While it is true that international legal instruments to protect nations from disinformation are underdeveloped, Bangladesh should explore possibilities because there is clear evidence that some Indian media are spreading fake news. The Rumour Scanner identified a viral video claiming to show a temple attack in Bangladesh as fake, which was in fact taken in India during an idol immersion. The 1981 UNGA Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States, voted positively by both Bangladesh and India, mandates states to abstain from defamatory campaigns or hostile propaganda intended to interfere in another state’s internal affairs. It is a precedent that the government can call on the UN’s attention because the way Indian authorities responded to and some media outlets reported on the arrest of Chinmoy is an explicit case of unwarranted interference. The government should, under the circumstances, strengthen its capacity to combat disinformation and to ensure people’s right to reliable information. It should diplomatically engage with the Bharatiya Janata Party’s government in India to take actions against their communally oriented media that are intentionally spreading fake news about minority affairs in Bangladesh. In the long term, the government should consider ratifying two international treaties, the 1936 International Convention on the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace and the 1953 Convention on the International Right of Correction, that address defamatory campaigns or hostile propaganda.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/252401/timely-call-to-meta-to-contain-disinformation-on-bangladesh
