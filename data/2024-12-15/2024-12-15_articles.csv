Coldwave hampers daily life across Bangladesh,"Bangladesh is currently facing its first tangible coldwave of the season, with temperatures dropping sharply across various regions. According to the Bangladesh Meteorological Department, a mild coldwave is sweeping over the northern and western districts, including Panchagarh, Rajshahi, Jashore, and Chuadanga. This weather pattern is expected to persist over the coming days, accompanied by dense fog in many areas. The Meteorological Office reported that the lowest temperatures were recorded in northern districts, with conditions expected to remain challenging through mid-December. The coldwave is being driven by the extended influence of the subcontinental high-pressure area over the West Bay of Bengal and adjoining areas. Meanwhile, the low-pressure system in the South Bay of Bengal, extending toward the North Bay, continues to influence local weather patterns. International weather agencies have corroborated the forecasts, noting that Bangladesh is currently experiencing below-average seasonal temperatures. Historical data indicates that December lows in the country typically range from 15 degrees Celsius to 19 degrees Celsius, while current readings in several districts have dropped to single digits, with Tetulia and Chuadanga recording some of the coldest temperatures. Looking ahead, the BMD forecasts that nighttime temperatures may decrease slightly over the next three days, while daytime temperatures may rise marginally. Moderate to dense fog is expected to persist during the early hours, especially in northern and central regions. By Tuesday, both day and night temperatures may see a slight increase, offering some relief from the current cold spell. International agencies also predict drier weather conditions in Bangladesh through December, with no significant rainfall expected. This is consistent with the seasonal pattern, as December typically experiences the lowest rainfall of the year. Weather models further suggest that the extended high-pressure system over the region may keep temperatures suppressed until late December. Residents are advised to take precautions against the cold, particularly during nighttime and early morning hours. Vulnerable populations, including children and the elderly, are urged to avoid prolonged exposure to the cold.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/environment-climate-change/252869/coldwave-hampers-daily-life-across-bangladesh
Dhaka becomes 3rd most polluted city with AQI score of 283,"Dhaka, the overcrowded capital of Bangladesh, ranked third on the list of cities with the worst air quality, recording an AQI score of 283 at 8:35am on Sunday. The air was classified as ‘very unhealthy’ according to the air quality and pollution rankings. Kuwait City of Kuwait, and Baghdad’s Iraq, occupied the first and second spots on the list, with AQI scores of 659 and 600, respectively. An AQI between 151 and 200 is said to be ‘unhealthy’ while 201 and 300 is considered ‘very unhealthy’, and 301 to 400 is ranked ‘hazardous’, posing serious health risks to residents. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants — Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2 and Ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon. As per the World Health Organisation, air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/environment-climate-change/252868/dhaka-becomes-3rd-most-polluted-city-with-aqi-score-of-283
39 killed in attacks in Niger near Burkina Faso,"Thirty-nine people have been killed in two attacks in recent days in western Niger, the country’s defence ministry said Saturday, near the border with Burkina Faso. ‘Two horrific tragedies happened in the communities of Libiri and Kokorou, criminals... launched attacks on defenceless civilian populations,’ with children among those killed, the defence ministry said in a statement.

US in contact with new Syria rulers,"The United States said on Saturday that it made contact with Syria’s victorious Hayat Tahrir al-Sham rebels, as Western and Arab states along with Turkey jointly voiced support for a united, peaceful Syria. US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s comment on ‘direct contact’ with the HTS rebels came despite the United States having designated the group as terrorists in 2018. While Blinken and other diplomats held talks on Syria in Aqaba, Jordan, Turkey reopened its embassy in Damascus, nearly a week after the Islamist-led rebels toppled president Bashar al-Assad, and 12 years after Ankara’s diplomatic mission was shuttered early in Syria’s civil war. ‘We’ve been in contact with HTS and with other parties,’ Blinken told reporters, without specifying how the contact took place. Ankara has been a major player in Syria’s conflict, holding considerable sway in the northwest, financing armed groups there, and maintaining a working relationship with HTS which spearheaded the offensive that brought down Assad. The Turkish flag rose over the diplomatic mission in an embassy district of Damascus, in the presence of the new charge d'affaires Burhan Koroglu, an AFP journalist said. In a joint statement after the meeting in Jordan, diplomats ‘affirmed the full support to the Syrian people at this critical point in their history to build a more hopeful, secure and peaceful future.’ They called for a Syrian-led transition to ‘produce an inclusive, non-sectarian and representative government formed through a transparent process’, with respect for human rights. ‘Syria finally has the chance to end decades of isolation,’ the group said. The head of the US-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, in the country’s northeast, on Saturday appealed on X for Kurds ‘to adopt a favourable position toward the Syrian dialogue’. UN special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen urged participants in the Jordan talks to provide humanitarian aid and to ensure ‘that state institutions do not collapse’. A Qatari diplomat said on Friday that a delegation from the Gulf emirate would visit Syria on Sunday to meet transitional government officials for talks on aid and the reopening of its embassy. Unlike other Arab states, Qatar never restored diplomatic ties with Assad after a rupture in 2011. The European Union’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said in Jordan that the bloc, Syria’s biggest aid provider, is ‘interested in rebuilding and reconstruction of Syria.’ Assad fled Syria hours before rebel forces seized Damascus, five former officials told AFP. His flight left Syrians in joyous disbelief at the sudden end to an era in which suspected dissidents were jailed or killed, and capped more than a decade of war that killed in excess of 5 lakh people and displaced millions. Sunni Muslim HTS is rooted in Syria's branch of Al-Qaeda and is designated a ‘terrorist’ organisation by many Western governments. But the group has sought to moderate its rhetoric. The interim government insists the rights of all Syrians will be protected, as will the rule of law. ‘We appreciate some of the positive words we heard in recent days, but what matters is action -– and sustained action,’ Blinken said. If a transition moves forward, ‘we in turn will look at various sanctions and other measures that we have taken’, he added. Pubs and liquor stores in Damascus initially closed following the rebel victory but are now tentatively reopening. ‘“You have the right to work and live your life as you did before”,’Safi, the landlord of Papa bar in the Old City, said the rebels had told him. But in Abu Dhabi, Anwar Gargash, a presidential adviser in the United Arab Emirates, said ‘we need to be on guard’ despite HTS’s talk of unity. Thousands of Syrians have swarmed the country's notorious detention centres over the past week, seeking evidence that might lead them to loved ones who disappeared under Assad's repressive rule. Some former prisoners, like Mohammed Darwish, are also returning as free men to where they were once incarcerated, trying to find closure. ‘When the door closed behind us, we were plunged into the depths of despair. This cell was witness to so much tragedy,’ he said, back at his former windowless cell in a Damascus prison. Syrians also face a struggle for necessities in a country ravaged by war, runaway inflation and sanctions that were imposed against Assad's government. Assad was propped up by Russia –– where a former aide told AFP he fled to –– as well as Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group. The rebels launched their offensive on November 27, the same day a ceasefire took effect in the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon, in which Assad’s ally suffered staggering losses. Naim Qassem, the leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah, admitted on Saturday that, with Assad’s fall, his group can no longer be supplied militarily through Syria. He also said he hoped Syria's new rulers see Israel ‘as an enemy’ and do not normalise ties with the country. Both Israel and Turkey have carried out military strikes inside Syria since Assad's fall. A Britain-based war monitor reported more Israeli strikes Saturday on military facilities. To Gargash, the UAE adviser, such strikes are ‘dumb politics’, even though ‘to structurally degrade Syrian capabilities might be seen as a sensible thing from an Israeli practical point of view’. Israel has also ordered troops into a UN-patrolled buffer zone that separated Israeli and Syrian forces on the Golan Heights, a move the UN said violated a 1974 armistice. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, now using his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa, said the Israeli move ‘threatens a new unjustified escalation in the region’. But ‘the general exhaustion in Syria after years of war and conflict does not allow us to enter new conflicts,’ he said in an online statement.

Mainz hand Bayern first league loss under Kompany,"Two goals from Jae-sung Lee lifted Mainz to a shock 2-1 home win over Bayern Munich on Saturday, handing coach Vincent Kompany his first league loss. Lee scored in each half against an uncharacteristically poor Bayern, who are now just four points clear after Bayer Leverkusen's 2-0 win at Augsburg. ‘We played against a team with a lot of life and spirit and who was prepared to fight for every moment. Today we weren't at our best,’ Kompany said. ‘We'll use the defeat today to build fire into the game on Friday (at home to RB Leipzig) because that's the only way we can provide an answer.’ Injuries meant Kompany was unable to call on several first team regulars including Harry Kane, Manuel Neuer, Alphonso Davies, Kingsley Coman, Serge Gnabry and Joao Palhinha. Kane's absence was particularly telling in the first half, with the league leaders dominating possession but unable to convert any of their half chances into a goal. Mainz boasted a better-than-expected home record against the German giants, having won three of their past four home league games over Bayern. The home side struck shortly before half-time, Lee taking advantage of a poor clearance from his South Korea teammate Min-Jae Kim to hammer home. Even with the knowledge that Leverkusen were ahead in Augsburg, Bayern came out poorer after half-time, lacking precision and energy. Mainz soon capitalised through Lee again. Armindo Sieb threaded a clever cross goalwards for Lee to collect before blasting home on the spin. Leroy Sane tapped in a deflected Joshua Kimmich shot in the 87th minute to give the league leaders hope, but Mainz held firm for a famous home win. The result moved Mainz, who battled relegation last season, up to sixth. Defending champions Leverkusen continued their recent resurgence, winning comfortably 2-0 at Augsburg, their seventh victory in a row. Martin Terrier put Leverkusen in front 14 minutes in, curling the ball home with his first touch after a lovely low cross from Jeremie Frimpong. Florian Wirtz added a second in the 40th minute when he controlled the ball, sold the Augsburg defence a dummy before skipping a shot across the grass and into the bottom corner. Union Berlin drew 1-1 at home against last-placed Bochum in a game suspended by around half an hour after the visiting goalkeeper was hit by an object thrown from the crowd. Bochum, were reduced to 10 men when Koji Miyoshi was red carded 13 minutes in, took the lead through Ibrahima Sissoko despite the deficit 10 minutes later. Union levelled things up through Benedict Hollerbach in the 33rd minute, but were unable to take advantage against their undermanned opponents. With the game in stoppage time and Union pushing, Patrick Drewes was hit by what appeared to be a cigarette lighter, with the refree ordering the players off the pitch. When they returned, both sides kicked the ball between themselves until the clock wound down, apparently in agreement not to attack after the incident. Bochum striker Philipp Hofmann, who replaced Drewes between the sticks, said the incident was ‘a shame on an otherwise likeable club’. In Saturday's late game, goals from Derrick Koehn and Marvin Ducksch took Werder Bremen to a 2-0 win at St Pauli, taking them up to seventh in the table. The match was interrupted by smoke from pyrotechnics for 10 minutes in the second half. A double from Alassane Plea and goals to Robin Hack and Tim Kleindienst took Borussia Moenchengladbach to a 4-1 win over Holstein Kiel. Gladbach have now lost just one of their past eight league games while Kiel, playing their first season in the top flight, sit second last.

"Jota rescues 10-man Liverpool, Arsenal frustrated","Diogo Jota rescued Liverpool as the Premier League leaders recovered from Andy Robertson's early red card to snatch a 2-2 draw with Fulham, while Arsenal's title challenge was dented by a goalless stalemate against Everton on Saturday. With just four minutes left at Anfield, Arne Slot's side were in danger of losing for just the second time in 15 top-flight games this season. But Jota grabbed a valuable equaliser as Liverpool extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 19 matches since a loss to Nottingham Forest in September. With last weekend's Merseyside derby at Everton postponed by severe weather, Liverpool have now gone two league games without a win following their 3-3 draw at Newcastle. The Reds sit five points clear of second-placed Chelsea, who can close the gap with a win against Brentford at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Liverpool were rocked in the 11th minute as Fulham midfielder Andreas Pereira met Antonee Robinson's cross with an agile volley that deflected in off Robertson. The Reds suffered another blow when Scotland left-back Robertson was sent off in the 17th minute for a professional foul on Harry Wilson. But Slot's men have made a habit of coming from behind this season and Cody Gakpo equalised in the 47th minute with a stooping header from Mohamed Salah's cross. Fulham forward Rodrigo Muniz delivered a sucker punch as he bundled over the line from Robinson's cross in the 76th minute. That set the stage for a dramatic finale as Jota levelled in the 86th minute with a cool finish past Bernd Leno from the edge of the area. ‘I don't think I could have asked for more from my players, especially after going down to 10 men,’ Slot said. ‘It's an emotional game. It's good to see our performance after so many setbacks.’ Arsenal failed to take advantage of Liverpool's rare stumble as the Gunners were kept at bay on a frustrating afternoon at the Emirates Stadium. The north Londoners have become a force from set-pieces, scoring 23 goals from corners since the start of last season. But their lack of firepower outside of that route has been questioned this season and once again they were hampered by a failure to turn pressure and possession into goals. After a second successive league draw, third-placed Arsenal remain six points behind Liverpool, who have a game in hand on last season's runners-up. ‘We fully deserved to win the game,’ Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said. ‘It's Frustrating, especially when we concede zero chances and dominate the game so much.’ Nottingham Forest climbed to fourth place after staging a dramatic late fightback to beat Aston Villa 2-1 at the City Ground. Jhon Duran put sixth-placed Villa in front with a powerful header from John McGinn's 63rd minute cross. But Forest levelled with three minutes left when Nikola Milenkovic's header crept past Emiliano Martinez's weak attempted save. And Anthony Elanga's composed close-range finish in stoppage-time sealed Forest's third victory in their last four games. Newcastle handed Ruud van Nistelrooy his first defeat as Leicester boss with a 4-0 rout at St James' Park. Former Manchester United striker Van Nistelrooy had taken four points from his first two games since replacing the sacked Steve Cooper. But Newcastle ended that encouraging start as Jacob Murphy struck in the 30th minute and Bruno Guimaraes nodded the second goal in the 47th minute. Alexander Isak bagged the Magpies' third two minutes later and Murphy netted again on the hour to leave Leicester two points above the relegation zone. Jack Taylor's stoppage-time goal gave Ipswich a priceless 2-1 win over relegation rivals Wolves at Molineux. Ipswich went ahead through Matt Doherty's 15th minute own goal before Matheus Cunha grabbed a 72nd minute equaliser. Taylor headed home from a 94th minute corner to seal Ipswich's second league win since their promotion to the top tier. Third-bottom Ipswich are just one point adrift of safety, while second-bottom Wolves are three points behind them after an 11th loss in 16 league games piled further pressure on boss Gary O'Neil.

Jasod leader killed during police drive,"A Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal-jasod leader was killed during an anti-drug drive by the police on Friday night at Bheramara upazila in Kusthia. A Jasod press release issued on Saturday claimed that the police brutally beat Chandipur ward Jasod leader Rafiqul Islam Dudu and broke his neck and threw him from over a bridge on Friday night although he had no police case or  complaint against him. Jasod demanded exemplary punishment of the police personnel responsible for the extrajudicial killing of Rafiqul, also the brother of Jasod Chandgram union unit general secretary Mustafizur Rahman, the  release stated. Bheramara police officer-in-charge Rafiqul Islam said that Rafiqul Islam Dudu, 45, who ran a tea stall in the area and had allegations against him of drug peddling. ‘We don’t know he is a Jasod leader or not. We ran an anti-drug drive and as he saw the police, he jumped from a bridge. Local people recovered him with injuries and took him to the upazila health complex where duty doctors declared him dead,’ the officer told New Age on Saturday. He said that the victim’s body was buried on Saturday following autopsy. The officer-in-charge also said that the local people during the late evening drive held three police members. A team of Bangladesh Army and Border Guard Bangladesh rescued them and handed them over to the police station at about 3:00am on the day.

Bangladesh not yet home for all citizens: discussion,"Academics, professionals and minority leaders on Saturday alleged that Bangladesh had failed to become a state for all its people in the more than five decades of its independence. ‘Therefore, the foundation of establishing a non-discriminatory state lies in the commitment to non-communalism, equal rights and dignity for all citizens,’ they said. The remarks came at a discussion on the ‘Human rights of religious and ethnic minority communities: tasks and responsibilities’ organised by Minority Unity Movement at the CIRDAP auditorium in Dhaka city. They also said that all political parties since the independence of Bangladesh used the minority people for political gains, but no one was ever truly committed to establishing the rights and dignity of the minority communities. Dhaka University former professor Syed Anwar Husain said, ‘Our dream that Bangladesh would be a humane country remains elusive till today.’ ‘State religion has caused the biggest destruction in Bangladesh,’ he said, adding that secularism and state   religion, both included in the constitution, were in stark contradiction with each other. ‘We have to uphold the spirit of the War of Independence because we cannot survive destroying the spirit of the war of liberation,’ he said. ‘I believe that “minority” is the most undemocratic word in the constitution because all are citizens of the country,’ he also said, adding that the word would have to be removed from the constitution. Dhaka University law professor Hafizur Rahman Curzon said that the War of Independence and its spirit were the worst victims of discrimination after August 5, and an environment of fear prevailed in the country. He also demanded the immediate release of Hindu religious leader Chinmoy Krishna Das arrested on the charges of sedition. ‘We need a universal identity that will not be based on religion. Attacks on minorities are a symptom of the disease, the root is communalism,’ said Professor Curzon. He raised a question as to why the population of both religious and ethnic minority communities was decreasing in Bangladesh and if there was communal harmony why Hindu and Buddhist temples, mosques and churches needed to be guarded. Professor Curzon also felt the need to work more closely with all international human rights organisations and institutions, including the United Nations. Manindra Kumar Nath, acting general secretary of the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, said that 2,010 incidents of violence were perpetrated against minorities across the country between August 4 and August 20. He mentioned that the violence included nine killings, attacks and vandalism at 69 temples, four rape incidents, attacks on and looting of 915 residences of minorities, attacks and vandalism at 953 business establishments, torture of 38 people, and grabbing of 21 businesses. The sectarian violent incidents still continued, Manindra said. Dhaka University professor Zobaida Nasreen said that communalism was practised in various ways throughout the post-independence period. She also said that attacks against minorities could not be justified on the pretext of political involvement. The reason behind filing cases against minority leaders was to keep them in fear, she said, urging the minority people to protest together. Journalist Abu Sayeed Khan, advisory editor of Samakal, said that it was sad but true that communalism could not be eradicated from Bangladesh’s soil. ‘Whenever there is a change of government, indiscriminate persecution of minority communities breaks out,’ he lamented. Human rights activist Shamsul Huda said that material interests are involved behind the attacks on minorities. If minorities are not protected, a state cannot be a civilized state, he added. ‘Minorities have been used as a trump card by all governments, and are still being used,’ said Father Albert T Rosario, a Christian cleric. Minority leader Theophil Nokrek said that the constitution did not properly recognise ethnic groups. Indigenous people wanted recognition as indigenous people, he said, adding that the International Labour Organisation conventions 107 and 169 must be implemented to ensure national minority communities’ land rights. Lawyer Subrata Chowdhury said that today there was discrimination in all areas. ‘We have no option but to protest on the streets,’ he said. The speakers also said in the discussion that both minority communities and the majority community come together and take to the streets to protest against all communal forces. Speakers from the discussion demanded withdrawal of all cases against the minority leaders, including Rana Dashgupta, filed after August 5, saying that they were based on false allegations. They also demanded immediate release of the minority people and leaders, Hindu religious leader Chinmoy Krishna das Brahmachari. Minority Unity Movement leaders at the programme said that they would prepare a position paper with recommendations received from the discussion to submit to all the reform commissions set up by the interim government. In another development, politicians and religious minority leaders on Saturday urged the interim government to take more steps to resolve sectarian issues that occurred in the country after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina regime on August 5. They made the demand in a discussion organised by the Bangladesh Jatiya Hindu Mahajote at the National Press Club in Dhaka. The organisation’s president Dinabandhu Roy chaired the meeting. Barrister Rumin Farhana, a central leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and a former lawmaker, said that if the parliament could have reserved seats for women it could have reserved seats for religious minorities also. Gobinda Chandra Pramanik, the secretary general of the Mahajote, read out the keynote paper at the discussion. He urged the interim government to take immediate steps to resolve sectarian issues across the country. He demanded reserved seats for the religious minorities in the national and other elections. Ehsanul Mahbub Joabaer, an assistant secretary general of the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, also favoured the issue of keeping reserved seats for the Hindu minority in the elections. Asraf Ali Akond, a presidium member of the Islami Andolan Bangladesh, said that their party favoured proportional system of elections for ensuring more representation in the parliament.

South Korea president impeached,"South Korean lawmakers on Saturday impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol over his failed martial law bid, with the opposition declaring a ‘victory of the people’. The vote capped more than a week of intense political drama in the democratic South following Yoon’s failed attempt to impose martial law on December 3. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of the capital Seoul in rival rallies for and against Yoon on Saturday. In a televised address following the parliamentary vote, the impeached Yoon said he would ‘step aside’ but did not apologise for his botched bid to impose martial law. Out of 300 lawmakers, 204 voted to impeach the president on allegations of insurrection while 85 voted against. Three abstained, with eight votes nullified. With the impeachment, Yoon has been suspended from office while South Korea’s Constitutional Court deliberates on the vote. The court has 180 days to rule on Yoon’s future and Chief Justice Moon Hyung-bae vowed to hold ‘a swift and fair trial’. If the court backs his removal, Yoon will become the second president in South Korean history to be successfully impeached. Two hundred votes were needed for the impeachment to pass, and opposition lawmakers needed to convince at least eight parliamentarians from Yoon’s conservative People Power Party (PPP) to switch sides. ‘Today’s impeachment is the great victory of the people,’ opposition Democratic Party floor leader Park Chan-dae said following the vote. PPP lawmaker Kim Sang-wook told broadcaster JTBC that Yoon had ‘completely betrayed the values of conservatism’. ‘That is why we, as ruling party lawmakers, have decided to remove him ourselves,’ he said. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo—now the nation’s interim leader—said in an address to the nation that he ‘deeply acknowledges the heavy responsibility for the current situation’ and ‘sincerely apologises to the people’. ‘What is most important right now is that there must not be even the slightest gap in the administration of state affairs,’ said Han, who convened a National Security Council late Saturday evening. A Seoul police official told AFP at least 200,000 people had massed outside parliament in support of removing the president. Choi Jung-ha, 52, danced in the street after the vote. ‘Isn’t it amazing that we, the people, have pulled this off together?’ she told AFP. ‘I am 100 percent certain the Constitutional Court will side with the impeachment.’ On the other side of Seoul near Gwanghwamun square, police estimated 30,000 had rallied in support of Yoon, blasting patriotic songs and waving South Korean and American flags. ‘Yoon had no choice but to declare martial law. I approve of every decision he has made as president,’ supporter Choi Hee-sun, 62, told AFP before the vote. The Democratic Party said ahead of the vote that impeachment was the ‘only way’ to ‘safeguard the Constitution, the rule of law, democracy and South Korea’s future’. ‘We can no longer endure Yoon’s madness,’ spokeswoman Hwang Jung-a said. At the rally outside parliament supporting impeachment, volunteers gave out free hand warmers on Saturday morning to fight the subzero temperatures, as well as coffee and food. K-pop singer Yuri of the band Girls’ Generation—whose song ‘Into the New World’ has become a protest anthem—said she had prepaid for food for fans attending the demonstration. ‘Stay safe and take care of your health!’ she said on a superfan chat platform. One protester said she had rented a bus so parents at the rally would have a place to change diapers and feed their babies. Another said they had initially planned to spend their Saturday hiking. ‘But I came here instead to support my fellow citizens,’ Kim Deuk-yun, 58, told AFP. Yoon’s future will now be determined by the court, which has previously blocked an impeachment. In 2004, then-president Roh Moo-hyun was removed by parliament for alleged election law violations and incompetence, but the Constitutional Court later reinstated him. The court currently only has six judges, meaning their decision must be unanimous. Following Saturday’s vote, parliament speaker Woo Won-shik said the National Assembly would seek to nominate three more judges to the court as soon as possible. ‘The future of South Korea lies within its people,’ he said. Yoon remained unapologetic and defiant as the fallout from his disastrous martial law declaration deepened and an investigation into his inner circle has widened. His approval rating—never very high—plummeted to 11 percent, according to a Gallup Korea poll released Friday. The same poll showed that 75 percent supported his impeachment. Following Yoon’s impeachment, a spokeswoman for the European Union called for a ‘swift and orderly resolution’ to the political crisis in line with South Korea’s constitution.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/252858/south-korea-president-impeached
"BNP aims to build a democratic, inclusive Bangladesh: Tarique","Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting chairman Tarique Rahman on Saturday said that BNP aimed to build a democratic, fair and inclusive Bangladesh that would be livable and enjoyable for all, through the united efforts of everyone. Tarique Rahman came up with his remark while virtually exchanging views with a group of people with disabilities at the Local Government Engineering Department LGED auditorium at  Agargaon in Dhaka. He said that his party was committed to taking concrete steps to improve the quality of life of the people with special needs, focusing on ensuring their economic independence, social empowerment and human dignity. He said that if the BNP formed the government, it would initiate steps to establish a separate directorate to coordinate activities of various ministries and departments alongside carrying out specific programmes. Tarique said that his party was also determined to build a dignified, capable, and prosperous society for people with special needs. He said, ‘The democratic Bangladesh that we will build together will be fair for all, inclusive for all, livable for all, and enjoyable for all.’ As part of his political responsibility, Tarique expressed his desire to cooperate with the physically challenged people to help them explore their talents and achieve self-sufficiency. He also promised that no one would be subjected to discrimination or left behind due to physical limitations in the future Bangladesh. Tarique said, ‘I want to assure you that if BNP forms the government, we will always stand by your side. I believe no one of you is disabled. Rather, you are all specially capable citizens, each of you possessing immense potential.’ BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, meanwhile, said, ‘We are always hopeful. An interim government has been established, and we are all cooperating.’ ‘Arrangements for elections will be made very soon as per the people’s expectations,’ he told journalists after paying tribute to the martyred intellectuals of 1971 at Martyred Intellectuals Graveyard at Mirpur in the capital. He also said, ‘Through free, fair, and impartial elections, the people will have the opportunity to elect their representatives, form the parliament, and establish the government.’ In response to a query, the BNP leader criticised the Awami League, accusing it of losing connection with the people. He further said, ‘Those who have distanced themselves from the people, killed democracy, suppressed pro-democracy and freedom-loving individuals, and sold out our independence have naturally become isolated.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/252857/bnp-aims-to-build-a-democratic-inclusive-bangladesh-tarique
Reform should focus on bringing healthcare to doorstep: discussion,"Health rights activists, policy makers and experts at a discussion on Saturday said that the health sector reform should have a special focus on bringing universal primary healthcare coverage to people’s doorsteps. Universal Health Coverage Forum, a coalition of multi-skilled professionals, hosted the dialogue titled ‘Reform Pathways for Health Sector’ in partnership with BRAC at the BRAC Centre Auditorium in Dhaka. They also called for a drastic reform of the health system in line with the declaration in the constitution for strengthening secondary and emergency healthcare. They said that hospitals’ financial autonomy to manage resources, including manpower, salaries, and allowances might bring better services to people. The dialogue convened policymakers, health professionals, civil society members, and development partners to assess the current state in Bangladesh’s health sector and identify actionable reform agendas. UHC Forum convener Hossain Zillur Rahman, also the chairperson of BRAC, said, ‘We need to approach healthcare with a focus on multiple angles like access to care and service delivery, community engagement, and the promotion of preventive health.’ ‘We must prioritise quality services that are patient-centred while also addressing health finance, human resources, and the overall capacity of the health sector,’ he said. Dhaka University’s Institute of Health Economics professor Syed Abdul Hamid said, ‘There is no universal public health coverage, and to reduce out-of-pocket health expenditure we need social insurance for all.’ He also called on the government to reform public financial management rules. Health Services Division secretary Md. Saidur Rahman said that physicians were deprived of promotion because of blocked positions. ‘We must reform the sector to inspire doctors to work dedicatedly,’ he said. Medical Education and Family Welfare Division secretary Md Sarwar Bari said that health sector needed huge reform. He said that we must give priority to medical research and hospital autonomy. Former director general of the Directorate General of Health Services Abul Kalam Azad said that healthcare in Bangladesh suffered from inequitable access and inadequate service delivery, leaving providers and patients dissatisfied. Health Reform Commission member Professor Liaquat Ali said that legislative reform of health sector was important while private sector monitoring was also crucial. Speakers demanded constitutional reform of healthcare declaring health as right. International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh senior director Shams El Arifeen said that the DGHS was providing healthcare as well as doing monitoring, which is a clear conflict of interest. ‘Break the system. Same agency cannot provide services as well as monitor,’ he said. Health Reform Commission member Naila Zaman Khan said that healthcare terminology should reflect a more humane and approachable outlook, considering both accessibility and mental health. BRAC senior director Md Akramul Islam, among others, spoke at the event.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252856/reform-should-focus-on-bringing-healthcare-to-doorstep-discussion
Arab nations seek support for peaceful Syria,"Top diplomats from eight Arab countries, meeting in Jordan on Saturday, called for a peaceful transition in Syria with UN and Arab League support following Bashar al-Assad’s ouster. In a final statement after the talks in the Jordanian Red Sea port of Aqaba, foreign ministers from Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar said they had agreed to ‘support a peaceful transition process’ in Syria, ‘in which all political and social forces are represented’. Anti-Assad forces, led by Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), toppled the longtime ruler on Sunday following a lightning offensive. HTS is rooted in Al-Qaeda’s Syria branch and is designated as a ‘terrorist’ organisation by many Western governments but has sought to moderate its rhetoric. A transitional government installed by the rebel forces has insisted the rights of all Syrians will be protected, as will the rule of law. The foreign ministers, meeting in Aqaba in the presence of Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit, said the political process in Syria should be supported by ‘the United Nations and the Arab League, in accordance with the principles of Security Council Resolution 2254’ of 2015, which set out a roadmap for a negotiated settlement. The Arab diplomats also declared their backing for a transitional rule agreed upon by Syrians, which would enable ‘a political system that corresponds to the aspirations of all parts of the Syrian people, through free and fair elections overseen by the United Nations’. They also warned against ‘any ethnic, sectarian or religious discrimination’ and called for ‘justice and equality for all citizens’. In their statement, the ministers said state institutions must be preserved to stop Syria from ‘slipping into chaos’, also calling to boost joint ‘efforts to combat terrorism... as it poses a threat to Syria and to the security of the region and the world’. They condemned ‘Israel’s incursion into the buffer zone with Syria’, demanding ‘the withdrawal of Israeli forces’ from Syrian territory. They also denounced Israeli air strikes on Syria, which have targeted key military assets across the country in recent days. In addition to the Arab foreign ministers’ meeting, Jordan was also hosting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and top EU and UN officials for talks on Syria Saturday.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252855/arab-nations-seek-support-for-peaceful-syria

Bangladeshi migrants in Malaysia can sue Dyson: UK Court,"The United Kingdom Court of Appeal ruled on Friday that two dozen Bangladeshi and Nepali workers, allegedly subjected to forced labour in Malaysia, could sue Dyson, a British vacuum cleaner manufacturer in London. The 24 claimants, including a worker who passed away, filed the lawsuit in 2022 against Dyson Technology Ltd, Dyson Ltd, and Malaysian firm ATA Industrial or its sister company. The workers were employed to produce components for Dyson products. According to the lawsuit filed with London’s High Court, the workers endured unlawful wage deductions and physical abuse for failing to meet stringent production targets. Their lawyers argue that Dyson bears ultimate responsibility for these abuses. Dyson, which terminated its Malaysian subsidiary’s contract with ATA in 2021, denied the allegations and contended that the case should be heard in Malaysia, and not in Britain. In 2023, the UK High Court sided with Dyson and ruled that Malaysia was the appropriate jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal, however, overturned that decision, declaring London to be the ‘clearly and distinctly appropriate forum’ for the case. ‘This was a procedural hearing to determine where the main case should ultimately be heard,’ a Dyson spokesperson said, adding that the company disagreed with the appeal decision and was reviewing its legal options. The company, founded by James Dyson, employs around 2,500 people in Britain, primarily at its R&D center in Malmesbury, England. In July, Dyson announced it was cutting about 1,000 jobs. Over 1.2 million Bangladeshis have migrated to the south-east Asian country since 2004 as the country is one of the major destinations for Bangladeshi workers. The allegations of rights violations and abuse, however, were not new.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/diaspora/252851/bangladeshi-migrants-in-malaysia-can-sue-dyson-uk-court

Three Cs ruined credibility of data in AL regime,"Collusive behavior, capacity deficit and coordination failure have been identified as the main reason for lack of credible data on key socio-economic indicators during the Awami League regime ousted on August 5 amid a student-people uprising. Impacts of collusive behavior of politicians and public servants to distort data have been evident in all key metrics such as gross domestic product, inflation, labour force and poverty. The other two Cs –– capacity deficit and coordination failure –– have also led to the systemic compromise of data integrity or data-related disarray in the country over the years, according to the White Paper on the State of Bangladesh Economy. AL policymakers hardly paid attention to the call for maintaining proper methods in calculating data through out its unbroken tenure between January 2009 and August 2024, the white paper said. Experts and economists found it difficult to present an objective state of economy and development in absence of reliable data. Indicating various macroeconomic data, Policy Exchange Bangladesh chairman Masroor Reaz said that they were getting many data which were not available or delayed during the AL regime. He hoped that the availability of data in the most reliable form would increase in the coming days. When official statistics on key metrics such as the GDP, inflation, private investment or employment are unreliable, a disconnect between economic realities and policy responses is created, said the white paper. Appointed on August 29, a 12-member committee headed by Centre for Policy Dialogue distinguished fellow and economist Debapriya Bhattacharya submitted the white paper to the chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on December 1. The issue of reliable data has also been highlighted in at least eight of the 23 chapters of the white paper aiming to portray the mismanagements and irregularities of the AL regime. GDP growth rate has been the centre of attention because of apparent disjuncture with other key indicators, including private sector credit, revenue mobilisation, import payments for capital machines, energy consumption, export receipts and employment generation. Focusing on the issue, the white paper said that in the post-2013 period, the political policymakers took a special interest in GDP figures and surely made strong influences. A collusive group in the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics allegedly emerged to ensure that the economic performance of the country was maintained against all odds, be it only on paper, said the white paper. During the post-2019 period, this collusive group was largely maintaining the act. Data producers might have felt pressured to present an overly optimistic view of development characterised by accelerated economic growth, especially since past estimates were repeatedly manipulated, added the white paper. It highlighted the collusive behavior on inflation, one of the most talked about issues over the past two years. The unusual delay and reluctance to release the Consumer Price Index in August 2022 and only 8.4 per cent inflation for gross rent, fuel and lighting components against the price hike of fuel oil by Tk 50 with a potential domino effect pushing up prices of food, transport and utilities, among others it stated. The distrust of inflation data increased as the BBS made a revision in estimating inflation with an expanded commodity basket having 700 more items with the latest rebasing of 2021-22 CPI, creating an opportunity for the enumerators to use arbitrary judgements, said the white paper. Many commodities included in the new estimation method are largely unavailable at many market points of the country. Former World Bank Dhaka office chief economist Zahid Hussain, also a writer of the white paper preparation committee, said that suppression of inflation data below double digits in the past two years was linked to collusive behavior. Now the BSS seems to be providing actual data, he said, calculating that the double-digit inflation prevailed in August, October and November out of four months of the interim government completed on December 8. The white paper identified that discrepancies in standards and definitions had enabled the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics to report an inflated employment rate to appease the regime regarding the overall labour force. Poverty rates have been reduced to 18.7 per cent in 2022 from 26.5 per cent in 2016, but the poverty reduction rate does not go in parallel with a recent BBS study on Food Security Statistics 2023 that revealed that about 22 per cent of the households perceived themselves as moderate to severe food insecure. The sharp decline in extreme poverty surely raised the eyebrows of analysts, said the white paper. Recognising that political influences and priorities often guide statistical manipulations is crucial. This underscores the importance of accurate data as the backbone of effective policy making, the white paper said. Manipulated data can lead to devastating consequences, making the need for reliable data even more urgent, it added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252849/three-cs-ruined-credibility-of-data-in-al-regime-
Killing of Intellectuals: Answer to Zahir Raihan’s disappearance could solve mystery: Jamaat,"Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Mia Golam Parwar on Saturday said that the mystery over the killings of intellectuals would be revealed if the mystery of missing filmmaker Zahir Raihan was revealed. He came up with the remarks while addressing a discussion organised by the Dhaka City South unit of the party at the National Press Club in Dhaka marking the Martyred Intellectuals Day. Parwar said Zahir Raihan had taken up the task of documenting and researching the struggle of the Liberation War and the murder of intellectuals. ‘He wanted to uncover the reasons, evidence, and facts of the killings by visiting villages and remote areas and the nation believed that if Zahir Raihan’s documentary was published, unknown truths would come to light. However, by the last week of January [in 1972], he went missing,’ he said. The incident of intellectual killings remains shrouded in mystery to politicians and thinkers of the nation. The whereabouts of Zahir Raihan and his documentary are still unknown, said Parwar. The mystery of killings of intellectuals would be revealed if the mystery of missing of Zahir Raihan was known, he said. He also said although mystery of the murder of intellectuals has not been revealed even after 53 years of independence, there are still opportunities to identify the real killers.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252848/killing-of-intellectuals-answer-to-zahir-raihans-disappearance-could-solve-mystery-jamaat
Protection of parks from elevated expressway demanded,"Urban planners and environmental activists at a human chain protested the construction of the Dhaka Elevated Expressway segment from Karwanbazar to Plassey Crossing, citing the destruction of Panthakunja Park and Hatirjheel lake in the capital. Under the banner of ‘Bangladesh Gachh Rakkha Andolan’, the protesters also began a sit-in around 12:45pm Saturday, demanding the immediate cancellation of the project, inside Panthakunja Park, closed to the public since 2018 for renovation and project work, at Banglamotor in the city. ‘We will continue the sit-in until the construction is halted,’ said Amirul Rajiv, coordinator of Bangladesh Gachh Rakkha Andolan. Protesters highlighted that most trees in the six-acre park had already been cut down, and 41 pillars had been installed in Hatirjheel, partially filling its waterbody for the expressway extending to Plassey Crossing. Criticising the destruction of parks and waterbodies, especially when Dhaka’s air ranks as the world’s most polluted, the protesters expressed disappointment that the matter was happening under the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government that included an environmental rights activist as an adviser. Jahangirnagar University urban and regional planning professor Adil Mohammad Khan stated that the elevated expressway was initially designed to bypass Dhaka through Jatrabari. Its current extension through Hatirjheel and Panthakunja Park to Plassey Crossing was not part of the original plan. ‘This project will not only destroy public spaces and the environment but will also worsen traffic congestion on major city roads, including those near Dhaka University, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Nilkhet, and Plassey,’ he added. The protesters demanded accountability for officials involved in anti-public and anti-environment projects and called for their names to be publicly disclosed. They also urged the removal of the 41 pillars from Hatirjheel and reforestation in Panthakunja Park to restore biodiversity. The sit-in was led by Pavel Partha, an ecology and biodiversity researcher. The 46.73 km expressway, under a public-private partnership, aims to connect Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport to the Dhaka-Chattogram Highway at Kutubkhali via Kuril, Banani, Mohakhali, Tejgaon, Sonargaon Hotel, Moghbazar, and Kamalapur.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252847/protection-of-parks-from-elevated-expressway-demanded
"550 individuals’ Tk 15,000cr frozen for investigation","The Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit has frozen bank accounts of nearly 550 individuals and entities, holding around Tk 15,000 crore, over allegations of accumulating substantial assets through unethical means. BFIU officials said that the anti-money laundering agency started to freeze their accounts after the fall of the Awami League government on August 5. The frozen accounts belong to individuals including political leaders, businesspeople, and influential public figures tied to the Awami League-led government, they said. The investigations focus on financial irregularities, including money laundering, loan fraud, and asset misappropriation. Key figures include Sheikh Hasina’s family members such as her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, daughter Saima Wazed Putul, and nephew Radwan Mujib Siddiq Bobby. Accounts linked to her cousins Abul Hasanat Abdullah, Sheikh Salahuddin Jewel, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, and Sheikh Helal Uddin, along with their respective family members have also been frozen. The list extends to organisations like the Awami League’s research cell, the Centre for Research and Information, and its CRI-Young Bangla project. Several former ministers, MPs, and advisers close to Sheikh Hasina are under investigation. These include former Energy Adviser Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, Security Adviser Major General (retired) Tarique Ahmed Siddique, and NTMC’s former director general Major General (dismissed) Ziaul Ahsan. Accounts linked to former Bangladesh parliament speaker Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury and her family are also affected. Bankers said that given the scale and complexity of these allegations, the path toward effective accountability and recovery of misap propriated funds remained challenging. Prominent ministers in the previous government, such as Obaidul Quader, AHM Mustafa Kamal, Mohammad Hasan Mahmud, Tipu Munshi, Asaduzzaman Khan, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, and Saifuzzaman Chowdhury Javed, as well as their family members and related companies, are included in the investigation. The crackdown extends to major business conglomerates like S Alam, Beximco, Summit, Bashundhara, Orion and others. The S Alam Group, led by Saiful Alam Masud and his associates, is a central focus. Salman F Rahman of Beximco, along with his son and daughter-in-law, is also under investigation. The list also included Summit Group’s Mohammad Aziz Khan, Muhammad Faruk Khan, and 11 members of their family; Bashundhara Group chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan and 8 of his family members; Orion Group’s Obaidul Karim and 6 members of his family; Diamond World’s Dilip Kumar Agarwala and his wife; Nabil Group managing director Aminul Islam and 6 of his family members; Nasa Group’s Nazrul Islam Mazumder and his wife; the late Zainul Haque Sikder’s family, comprising 14 members; and Chowdhury Nafiz Sarafat, his wife Anjuman Ara Sahid and their son Rahib Safwan Sarafat Chowdhury. Figures from the banking and financial sector are also on the list, including Premier Bank chairman HBM Iqbal, NRBC Bank chairman SM Parvez Tamal, and former SBAC Bank chairman Abu Zafar Mohammad Shafi Uddin. Former Union Bank MD Mokammel Haque Chowdhury and former BSEC chairman Shibli Rubayat-Ul-Islam, along with eight of his family members, are being investigated. The BFIU has sought assistance from foreign authorities by sending letters requesting information on money laundering activities involving six major business groups. So far, the BFIU is investigating allegations of money laundering, loan fraud, and embezzlement of government funds against 20 business groups. Reports on entities like the S Alam Group and Saifuzzaman Chowdhury Javed’s family have already been submitted to the Criminal Investigation Department and Anti-Corruption Commission for legal action. Investigations are also going on regarding 18 other business groups, including Beximco, Summit, Bashundhara, Orion, Sikder, Nasa, and Nabil.

"Probes, trials of war crimes cases stalled","Investigations into and trials of 1971 war crimes cases pending with the International Crimes Tribunal have come to a standstill while cases filed on charges of crime against humanity during the July-August student-people uprising have got momentum. The war crimes accused, whether in jail custody or on bail, continue to appear before the tribunal, only to see the deferral of the hearings at the request of the prosecution. The tribunal has, however, been granting conditional bail to detained accused, on the grounds of health and delayed proceedings. Prosecutors and tribunal officials told New Age that the stagnation began following the ouster of Sheikh Hasina’s government through the student-people uprising on August 5. A tribunal official said that 30 war crimes cases against 113 detained suspects remained under investigation. At least 30 appeals filed by war crimes convicts against their sentences for death or imprisonment until death or life term have been pending with the Appellate Division since 2013, according to register book of the Appellate Division’s criminal cases The appellate process also suffers delays. Besides, former Jamaat-e-Bangladesh assistant general secretary ATM Azharul Islam’s review petition against the Appellate Division’s verdict that upheld his death sentence for war crime awaits Appellate Division’s hearing since July 2020. According to prison authorities, 64 individuals are detained in connection with war crimes. Among them, 45 convicts are on death row, six face sentence to imprisonment for life term or until death, and the rest 13 are under trial. Executed war crimes convicts included Jamaat leaders Motiur Rahman Nizami, Abdul Quader Mollah, Muhammad Kamruzzaman, Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid and Mir Quasem Ali, and Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Salauddin Quader Chowdhury while 25 accused died during the trials. In addition, 19 new cases and more than 100 complaints on charges of crimes against humanity committed during the July-August 2024 student-people uprising have been filed with the tribunal, which was reconstituted on October 14, 2024. Additionally, 26 individuals, including prominent Awami League leaders and law enforcement personnel, have been detained in jails in connection with the July-August crimes against humanity, according to prisons officials. Jurist Shadeen Malik emphasised the urgency of disposal of all pending war crimes cases, calling for an increase in the number of tribunals and benches at the Appellate Division. ‘It is essential to expand the number of judges at the ICT to deal with the volume of complaints lodged with the tribunal,’ he said. He also stressed the need for appointing more judges to the Appellate Division to effectively tackle the growing backlog of cases . The tribunal’s chief prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam, however, said, ‘It is too early to comment on whether new judges will be appointed or not.’ He said that the old cases would proceed as usual since no decision was made to alter the process. Commenting on the pending war crimes cases, defence lawyer Abdus Sattar Palowan stated that they would seek acquittal of all detained 1971 war crimes accused. ‘These individuals were politically targeted and implicated in the cases to serve the agenda of Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule, which collapsed amid the student-led mass uprising on August 5, 2024,’ he claimed. ICT prosecutor Tamim Gazi Monwar Hossain, who earlier defended 1971 war crimes accused, said that adjournments in war crimes cases were being sought for preparation of the new prosecutors. He explained that former prosecutors, backed by then AL government, fled after the regime change without handing over the case files. ‘We will seek fair justice from the reconstituted tribunal when it begins trials,’ Tamim said, adding, ‘I believe the accused in old cases did not receive impartial justice from the previous tribunal.’ Two tribunals were established in 2009 during the Awami League government to prosecute individuals accused of 1971 war crimes and crimes against humanity. The tribunals disposed of 55 cases, primarily targeting high-profile leaders of the Jamaat-e-Islami. The government later merged the two tribunals into one, which became dysfunctional after the retirement of the Tribunal-1 chairman, Justice Md Abu Ahmed Jamadar, as a High Court judge on June 16, 2024. To revive the tribunal, the government reconstituted the International Crimes Tribunal on October 14, 2024, appointing Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder of the High Court as its chairman. Earlier, on September 5, 2024, the law ministry appointed Mohammad Tajul Islam, a lawyer known for defending Jamaat-e-Islami leaders in war crimes cases, as the tribunal’s chief prosecutor. The home ministry followed up on September 18, reconstituting the ICT Investigation Agency with retired additional deputy inspector general Md Mazharul Haque as its chief coordinator to investigate allegations of crimes against humanity during the student-led mass uprising. Law adviser Asif Nazrul earlier on several occasions, while inspecting the renovation progress of the tribunal, reaffirmed the government’s commitment to holding fair trials of those involved in the July-August massacre. Asif Nazrul said that at least 1,500 students and civilians were killed, and thousands injured during indiscriminate firing ordered by the Awami League government during the July-August uprising.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252842/probes-trials-of-war-crimes-cases-stalled

Youth employment,"BANGLADESH, as a developing nation, faces significant economic challenges rooted in both domestic and international crises. Domestically, political uncertainty, mismanagement, weak governance, and systemic inefficiencies have created a landscape where the rights of the general population are continually eroded. Over time, these issues have become normalised, diminishing public trust in institutions. On the international front, geopolitical tensions and global trade barriers have further compounded these challenges, leaving the country in a precarious position. Over the past two decades, the public has grown weary of political rhetoric that prioritises personal and partisan interests over collective well-being. Among the most affected are young, educated individuals who face a bleak job market with limited opportunities. For a nation of 170 million, this lack of engagement from the youth — a key driver of innovation and growth — risks economic stagnation. Without creating pathways for young people to actively participate in the economy, Bangladesh risks failing to unlock its full potential. Faced with limited opportunities, many of Bangladesh’s youth seek futures abroad, often through perilous and illegal means. Ironically, the opportunities they pursue are not beyond reach but lie within their homeland. The inability to harness these opportunities is a reflection of systemic failures and leadership crises. As Michele Modyshydon Dattaws aptly remarked, ‘Don’t overlook the horizon next to the door.’ This oversight is emblematic of leadership’s failure to address the structural barriers that suppress the aspirations of the nation’s youth. Bangladesh’s struggles are exacerbated by internal structural challenges and the influence of international interest groups. While global interconnectedness is unavoidable, the inability of national leadership to balance external pressures with internal priorities has deepened the crisis. Leaders have often prioritised maintaining power over serving the public good, perpetuating cycles of inequality and discontent. Escaping this cycle will require strategic, long-term efforts focused on building inclusive systems that prioritise the nation’s collective aspirations. Empowering young people is a vital step in addressing these challenges. This empowerment requires not only creating jobs but also fostering environments where the youth can thrive within their homeland. A robust capital market can play a pivotal role in this transformation. By offering system-dependent instruments, the capital market can generate millions of jobs, enabling educated youth to participate meaningfully in the economy, as seen in many developed countries. Currently, Bangladesh’s job market is heavily reliant on physical sectors such as agriculture, garments, and knitwear. While these industries are critical, their growth potential is limited without integration with financial markets. Developing the capital market can complement these sectors, driving innovation and expanding job opportunities. By creating efficient, accessible, and investment-friendly financial systems, young individuals can actively engage in the market, fostering both personal and national economic growth. To achieve sustainable progress, it is crucial to address market inefficiencies and restore public confidence in economic systems. Educated youth, who are often hesitant to invest in traditional physical markets, must be encouraged to explore opportunities in the financial market. In developed nations, students often learn to navigate and earn from financial markets, a possibility largely absent in Bangladesh due to systemic inefficiencies. Addressing these gaps will enable broader participation, reduce social unrest, and create pathways to prosperity. Economic growth and social stability are inseparable from financial well-being. A concerted effort to empower the youth and develop the capital market can pave the way for Bangladesh to reclaim its future. This requires fostering trust, addressing inefficiencies, and creating opportunities that enable every individual to aspire to a better quality of life. By prioritising these measures, Bangladesh can break free from cycles of stagnation and move toward a future of inclusive and sustained growth.

Transforming Education: Path towards tech-driven learning,"OVER the past decade, Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in various sectors, with education being a key focus for the government. Despite these advancements, the country’s educational system still faces numerous challenges. Traditional teaching methods, limited resources and inadequate infrastructure continue to hinder the full potential of students. However, the digital revolution offers a unique opportunity to transform education, making it more inclusive, accessible and effective. This article explores how the integration of technology can reshape the future of learning and teaching in Bangladesh, providing a pathway toward a more innovative and modern educational landscape. Education in Bangladesh has undergone significant transformation over the years. With a population of over 170 million and a rapidly growing youth demographic, the country is working to meet the educational demands of its citizens. Bangladesh has made notable progress in primary school enrolment and gender equality in education. According to UNESCO, the country’s literacy rate has surpassed 70 per cent. However, despite these advancements, the quality of education remains below global standards. The integration of technology in education is becoming an increasingly popular solution to bridge the gap between quality and accessibility. From online courses to digital classrooms, technology is slowly but steadily making its way into Bangladesh’s education system. In urban areas, tech-based solutions have been implemented with varying degrees of success. However, rural regions continue to face significant challenges, including inadequate internet infrastructure, limited technical expertise and a lack of digital tools. Despite the growing interest in integrating technology into Bangladesh’s education system, several challenges hinder its widespread implementation. One of the most significant obstacles is the digital divide, with urban areas having far better access to digital tools, the internet and technological skills than rural regions. Many schools, particularly in remote areas, face severe infrastructure deficits, lacking basic necessities such as electricity, devices and reliable internet connectivity to support digital learning. Moreover, a significant number of teachers are not equipped with the training necessary to effectively incorporate technology into their teaching methods, which limits the impact of digital education. The shortage of locally relevant digital content in Bengali and other regional languages further compounds this problem, diminishing the effectiveness of tech-based learning tools. Additionally, the high cost of devices and internet services remains a major barrier, with many students from low-income families unable to afford the necessary resources, thus deepening educational inequality. To address the challenges in Bangladesh’s education system, the government, in collaboration with the private sector, NGOs and international organisations, has begun laying the foundation for a technology-driven approach to learning. However, for this transformation to succeed, it requires a carefully structured implementation protocol that not only addresses the immediate needs but also ensures long-term sustainability. A successful shift to technology-enabled education demands a cohesive strategy that tackles both short-term challenges — such as infrastructure gaps and teacher preparedness — and long-term goals, such as fostering digital literacy across the population and ensuring equitable access for all students. By aligning both immediate and future objectives, Bangladesh can build a robust, future-ready education system that harnesses the potential of technology while addressing the existing gaps in access, resources and quality. The first critical step in transforming education is to establish robust digital infrastructure, particularly in underserved and rural areas. The government must prioritise providing high-speed internet, reliable electricity and modern digital tools in schools. Collaborations with private sector companies and global tech firms can help develop affordable internet solutions, such as satellite broadband and mobile hotspots, ensuring connectivity even in the most remote regions. Additionally, solar-powered computers and mobile learning hubs can bridge the gap in areas with unreliable electricity, offering students the opportunity to access digital education. By building a strong infrastructure foundation, Bangladesh can foster an equitable learning environment, ensuring that all students, regardless of location, have access to the tools they need to succeed. Teachers are at the heart of educational transformation and their digital literacy is essential for the successful integration of technology in the classroom. To support this, the government must implement comprehensive and continuous teacher training programs that enhance educators’ proficiency in using digital tools for lesson delivery, assessments and student engagement. These programs should extend beyond basic digital literacy to provide teachers with strategies for incorporating interactive and collaborative technologies into their teaching practices. Certification programs can help ensure that teachers keep their skills up to date, while regional training centres can provide targeted support to educators in rural areas, addressing the digital divide between urban and rural schools. To maximise the effectiveness of digital learning, the government must prioritise the development and localisation of educational content that is both culturally relevant and linguistically accessible. This involves collaborating with educational content developers and edtech companies to create digital resources that align with the national curriculum and are available in Bangla and other regional languages. By localising content, students will have access to materials that are not only academically rigorous but also resonate with their cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Furthermore, promoting Open Educational Resources will facilitate the free sharing of content across schools and regions, expanding access to high-quality educational materials for all students. Public-private partnerships will be essential to the success of technology-driven education in Bangladesh. By collaborating with tech companies, internet service providers and NGOs, the government can bridge the digital divide and ensure that all students have access to affordable devices, internet services and educational platforms. Programs like ‘One Laptop per Child’ and partnerships with mobile service providers can help ensure that students from low-income backgrounds gain access to the technology they need. Additionally, tech companies can play a vital role by developing innovative learning tools and platforms, creating a digital ecosystem that supports diverse learning needs and aligns with the country’s educational objectives. Affordability is one of the biggest obstacles to the widespread adoption of technology in education. To address this challenge, the government should introduce subsidy programs for low-income households, ensuring affordable or even free access to devices and internet services. Financial support can also be provided to schools, enabling them to acquire digital tools and educational software that enhance the quality of learning. Furthermore, offering tax incentives to companies that donate technology to schools or engage in digital education initiatives will help expand access to critical resources, ease the financial burden on families and foster greater equity in education. Digital education should go beyond the classroom. The government must promote lifelong learning by encouraging students, parents and communities to engage with digital tools outside of school hours. Community-based learning centres, equipped with internet access and digital devices, can provide after-school opportunities for students to continue learning. Simultaneously, adult education programs can help parents and caregivers enhance their digital literacy. Public awareness campaigns can emphasise the importance of digital skills for personal and professional growth, fostering a culture of digital literacy that benefits everyone in society. To ensure the success and sustainability of technology integration, it is crucial to establish strong monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. The government should set up an independent body responsible for tracking the progress of the ICT in Education Master Plan, assessing its impact on learning outcomes, teacher performance and infrastructure development. Regular feedback from students, teachers and parents should be collected to continuously refine and enhance the digital education strategy. Data-driven decision-making will be vital to adapting the plan to emerging technological trends and the evolving needs of the education sector. This approach will help maintain the relevance and effectiveness of the program over time. By implementing the strategic steps outlined above, Bangladesh can fully harness the potential of technology in education, building a more inclusive, innovative and equitable system that equips students with the skills and knowledge to meet the challenges of the future. The shift towards a technology-enabled education system offers significant long-term benefits for Bangladesh, especially for students in underserved regions. With the advent of online learning platforms and digital content, students in remote areas can now access high-quality education without the need to travel long distances to schools or tutoring centers. This innovation democratises education by making it accessible to all, regardless of their geographical location and provides opportunities for students who may have otherwise been excluded from quality learning experiences. Technology has the potential to greatly enhance the quality of education by enabling personalised learning experiences. Tools like adaptive learning software allow students to progress at their own pace, helping them address gaps in understanding more effectively. Furthermore, digital content allows teachers to present lessons in more engaging and interactive ways, making the learning process richer and more dynamic for students. This approach not only improves student engagement but also supports deeper, more individualised learning. For teachers, technology provides the opportunity to streamline administrative tasks, giving them more time to focus on student engagement. Digital tools like learning management systems allow educators to track student progress, identify areas where students are struggling and implement targeted interventions. With ongoing training programs, teachers can also gain the skills needed to effectively integrate technology into their teaching methods, enhancing their overall effectiveness and improving the learning experience for students. Technology empowers students by equipping them with the tools necessary to thrive in a rapidly changing digital world. Familiarity with digital tools and online learning platforms prepares students for the challenges of the 21st-century job market, helping them develop essential skills like critical thinking, problem-solving and collaboration — competencies that are highly valued in today’s workforce. Providing digital resources to all schools, including those in marginalised communities, helps reduce educational inequality. Initiatives targeting underserved areas ensure that students, regardless of their socio-economic background or location, have equal access to high-quality learning opportunities, promoting greater equity in education. Widespread adoption of technology in education will play a key role in developing a skilled workforce capable of driving economic growth across multiple sectors, including technology, manufacturing, services and innovation. A digitally proficient population will fuel innovation, helping Bangladesh stay competitive in the global market and strengthen its position as an emerging economy. In conclusion, integrating technology into education in Bangladesh offers immense potential to improve learning outcomes, expand access and promote equity. By addressing challenges such as infrastructure gaps, teacher training and digital content development, Bangladesh can create an inclusive educational environment that nurtures all students’ talents. While progress has been made, achieving a fully technology-driven education system will require collaboration between the government, private sector and civil society. As the world increasingly values digital literacy, Bangladesh’s efforts to integrate technology in education are vital for preparing its youth for the future.

Sorry state of university medical centres unacceptable,"This is unacceptable that medical centres at most universities are in bad shape as they are crippled by a shortage of human resources, infrastructure and other facilities. The sorry state of the centres has limited the access of students, teachers and officials to quality and timely treatment. The centres are also supposed to provide for diagnostic facilities, but most equipment in the medical centres has fallen into disuse. The medical centre at the University of Rajshahi is beset with multiple problems such as the shortage of medicine, equipment, funding and human resources. While the centre has 36 positions of physicians and six of technologists, it has only 14 physicians and two technologists. The centre also does not have the required number of emergency medical officers and nurses. Three out of six positions of emergency medical officers and four out of six positions of nurses have been vacant for years. With such constraints, the authorities are reported to have suspended afternoon services at the centre while morning services are also hampered. When the centre is supposed to offer consultation and more than 40 medical tests, students are often denied the services. Students allege that most physicians do not attend office regularly and when they do, they only prescribe painkillers and refer patients to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital. The university authorities admit that the centre is not fully operational, there is a severe shortage of human resources and some devices are not functional. The authorities took an initiative in 2020 to recruit 13 physicians and other technologists and staff at the centre, but the process stalled. Medical centres at other universities, including the University of Dhaka, Jahangirnagar University and the University of Chittagong, are in no better shape. The University of Dhaka centre also suffers from a lack of adequate human resources and other facilities. Students allege that physicians often do not go to the centre, do not properly attend patients and often refer them to other hospitals even for treatment and services that are meant to be available there. Chittagong University students also allege that the medical centre is in a sorry state and whenever they visit the centre, the physicians, in most cases, prescribe analgesic tablets and refer them to other hospitals. Students also do not receive the basic treatment from dentists at the centre. The Jahangirnagar University centre is also in bad shape, causing immense suffering to students. The authorities should, therefore, attend to the issues. The authorities should also ensure that the centres have adequate human resources and provide all the services they are meant to provide.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/252807/sorry-state-of-university-medical-centres-unacceptable
Nation still in need of complete list of martyred intellectuals,"Martyred Intellectuals Day comes every year with a demand, as media report around that time, for a comprehensive list of the intellectuals that the nation had lost in the fag end of the liberation war at the hands of the Pakistani occupation forces and their local auxiliary squads, including Razakar, Al Badr and Al Shams, that abducted members of the Bangladeshi intelligentsia, mostly blindfolded and with their hands tied, from their houses to camps or other places. The people thus abducted — who included writers, scientists, artistes, singers, teachers, researchers, journalists, lawyers, physicians, engineers, architects, sculptors, government and non-government employees, people engaged in film and theatre and social and cultural activists — did not return. But the problem that remains is that the nation knows many of the intellectuals who went missing but never returned. Yet, no entity or agency, within the government and without, has any comprehensively conclusive list of the number of intellectuals who were killed by the Pakistani occupation forces and their local collaborators and who all these intellectuals were. It has been 53 years since Bangladesh became independent from West Pakistan through a liberation war that spanned nine months and the nation is still in the dark about the number of its intellectuals who died towards the end of the war. Successive governments since independence have failed to make a final list of the intellectuals martyred in the war. Families of the martyred intellectuals put the situation down to sheer negligence of successive governments. The previous Awami League government, toppled in a mass uprising on August 5, in November 2020 instituted a committee to make the final list of martyred intellectuals. The committee failed to do the job in four years. But based on the committee findings, the liberation war affairs ministry published 560 names in four lists — the first with 191 names on April 7, 2021, the second with 143 names on May 29, 2022, the third with 108 names on February 15, 2024 and the fourth with 118 names on March 24, 2024. Thirty cultural activists and individuals associated with films, theatre, music and other branches of arts are also named on the list. Whilst the liberation war affairs ministry has no complete list of martyred intellectuals, various government and private documents put the figure at 1,111. But researchers say that the figure could be 10 times higher. The fact-finding committee that the government set up in 1972 made a list of 20,000 of the finest minds of the nation killed then. ‘Bangladesh’, a government documentary publication in 1972 put the figure at 1,109. The national encyclopaedia of Bangladesh, Banglapedia, put an estimated figure of 1,111. The government also has yet to complete separate lists of the freedom fighters and the local collaborators of the Pakistani occupation forces. Lists of martyred intellectuals and freedom fighters are important for the government and the people to know who to accord honour to. The list of local collaborators of the Pakistani occupation force is also important. But all this has not happened although the issues have been in discussion for long and some efforts have been made. It is already time the government did all this, with accuracy and rising above any prejudice, if any, political or otherwise.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/252805/nation-still-in-need-of-complete-list-of-martyred-intellectuals
