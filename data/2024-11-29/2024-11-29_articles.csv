3 more detained amid countywide protests,"The police on Friday detained three more suspects amid protests in Dhaka and elsewhere over the killing of lawyer Saiful Islam Alif in Chattogram city and clashes with the law enforcers over the arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, a leader of an organisation of the Hindus. Also on the day, a number of organisations, including Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh, held countrywide protests, demanding arrest of the lawyer’s killers and banning the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, widely known as ISKCON. The police have tightened security of temples in Chattogram amid attacks on three Hindu temples in the port city and remained on alert at courts across the country to avoid any untoward incident. They have also said that they are on high alert in the capital. Amid the situation the minority issue is increasingly becoming a sore point  between Bangladesh and India. Quoting Kotwali police officer-in-charge Md Abdul Karim, New Age staff correspondent in Chattogram reported that the police detained three people in the Bakalia area of Chattogram city on Thursday night. The detainees are Babla Dhar, 42, son of the late Sunil Dhar from Kalamia Bazar in the city; Sajal Shil, 40, son of Dulal Shil of Ashiya Hindupara in the city; and Durlav Das. The police said that Durlav Das was identified from video footage as being in possession of a sharp weapon during the murder. Police officer Abdul Karim said, ‘Among the three detainees, one was directly involved in the lawyer’s murder and was armed with a sharp weapon.’ ‘All three have been sent to jail this morning after being produced before the court in a case related to the attack on law enforcement personnel,’ he said. He further added that no murder case had yet been filed by the family of lawyer Saiful Islam killed on November 26. The situation was tense after miscreants had vandalised three Hindu temples at Patharghata in the port city on Friday. Two of the temples, Sri Sri Radha Govinda temple and Sri Sri Shantaneshwari Matri Mandir are on Ashraf Ali Road near Jelepara, and Sri Sri Jagatbandhu Ashram is adjacent to Satish Babu Lane. Additional deputy commissioner for public relations of the Chattogram Metropolitan Police Kazi Md Tarek Aziz said that additional police forces were deployed at the three temples after the attacks had sparked tension. Police patrols were also intensified, he added. In the capital, Dhaka Metropolitan Police spokesperson Muhammad Talebur Rahman told New Age that they were on alert to prevent any untoward situation. Earlier on Thursday, Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed expressed deep concern over the recent security breaches at courts across the country, describing the incidents as ‘rare,’ ‘unprecedented’ and ‘alarming.’ He emphasised urgent measures to ensure the safety and security of judicial premises, judges and court officials. Various organisations, including Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh, meanwhile on the day, held protests across the country after Jumma prayers and demanded a ban on ISKCON. Hefazat leaders and activists held a protest rally in Dhaka, demanding a ban on ISKCON, and another in Chattogram, protesting at lawyer Saiful’s killing. Its Dhaka city unit arranged the protest rally and a procession at the north gate of the National Mosque Baitul Mukarram in which several thousand people joined. ‘A well-planned attempt is being made to destabilise Bangladesh and instigate a communal riot in the country,’ said Hefazat leader Mamunul Haque at the rally, condemning the murder of the lawyer. Hefazat leaders also said that the country’s defeated forces were using a section of Hindus to create chaos and anarchy and as part of that ISKCON was carrying out a malicious campaign. They urged people to stay vigilant against what they described as ‘communal provocations orchestrated by the fallen fascist regime and their masters.’ Hefazat-e-Islam in Chattogram also announced a long march of protest towards the Indian Embassy in the port city, scheduled for next Monday. Its joint secretary general Mufti Harun Izhar announced the programme. After Friday prayers, Hefazat supporters marched from Jamiatul Falah Mosque, passing through WASA intersection and GEC areas before concluding at 2 No Gate. Mufti Harun Izhar told the rally, ‘We will stage a peaceful long march towards the Indian High Commissioner’s office at 11:00am on Monday. No one will create unrest or throw stones during the programme.’ He added, ‘Our representatives will submit a memorandum on behalf of the “towhidi janata” to the embassy.’ On November 25, former ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari was arrested in Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport area. The next day, a Chattogram court denied him bail and sent him to jail. Clashes broke out when his followers blocked the prison van taking Chinmoy to jail, leading to the killing of lawyer Saiful Islam Alif on the court premises. Protests have since erupted in various districts, demanding justice for the murder and proscription of the ISKCON.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251569/3-more-detained-amid-countywide-protests
Fiscal pressure to persist despite foreign loans,"The interim government has made progress in mobilising more external loans from multilateral lenders but that will not reduce pressure on fiscal management due to lower than the expected domestic revenue generation, said economists. Finance Division officials have calculated that around $2.5 billion loan as budget support is expected to be released in the next month by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Asian Development Bank. The budget support will power the on-going government efforts in tackling the dollar shortage. But the increased flow of external loans will not reduce pressure on fiscal management as the domestic revenue generation still remains 1 per cent negative in the first four months of the current financial year of 2024–25 marked by the regime change on August 5 amid a student-led mass uprising. In a bid to get $500 million as budget support from the World Bank, the interim government, which has succeeded the Awami League regime, is likely to announce the separation of the policy department of the National Board of Revenue from its executive department soon. The separation has been a long pending issue between the Washington-based lender and the government since 2003. The separation of the policy department of the NBR from its executive department was even approved in 2008 by the then caretaker government. But the implementation of the decision had remained pending, said revenue board chairman Abdur Rahman Khan. Former World Bank Dhaka office chief economist Zahid Hossain observes though that the separation would not guarantee higher revenue generation immediately. Emphasising a meaningful separation he observes that engagement of skilled policymakers is imperative for fruitful outcomes in implementation of policy and checking corruption. Bangladesh is losing $355 million in tax annually because of corporate tax abuse and offshore tax abuse, according to a report titled ‘State of tax justice 2024’ released by the Tax Justice Network in the current month. The amount is 21.4 per cent of the country’s total health expenditure, states  the report of the United Kingdom-based global network. With an overall revenue generation target of Tk 4,80,000 crore for FY24–25, and against the target for the first four months, the revenue board has managed to collect around Tk 1,01,281 crore, facing a shortfall of Tk 30,831 crore. Economists said that the government’s reliance on borrowing from the banking sector would increase against the backdrop of lower than the expected revenue, and the situation might even lead it to mobilise more loans from the multilateral lenders. Fiscal management would remain a big challenge for the interim government due to the sloppy condition of the economy, said Research and Policy Integration for Development chairman Mohammad Abdur Razzaque. Blaming the previous regime’s reckless decision and management for the overall messy condition, he said that it was imperative for the government to reduce its expenditure. The projected loan from the banking sector in FY24–25 budget is Tk 1,37,500 crore, while Tk 90,700 crore has been projected to get from the foreign sources to meet the budget deficit of 4.6 per cent. Finance Division officials said that the interim government had successfully negotiated in increasing the World Bank’s budget support to $500 million from initially projected $250 million. The manila-based ADB is going to release $600 million in the next month from initially agreed $300 million, they said. The officials said that the IMF had given positive signals to the extra loan sought by the interim government in addition to the availability of the half-yearly tranche under the ongoing $4.7 billion loan programme since 2023. The immediate past political government took the loan to tackle the severe shortage of dollars. An IMF mission will arrive in the capital next week to negotiate over the extra loans and review the current loan programme. Finance secretary Khairuzzman Mozumder said that they were expecting to receive $1 billion loan as extra support from the IMF. The forex reserve hovering around $18.5 billion (as per Sixth Edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual standards) in November will improve with the release of the budget support from the multilateral lenders, said finance division officials.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251568/fiscal-pressure-to-persist-despite-foreign-loans-
Camavinga joins Real Madrid injury list,"French midfielder Eduardo Camavinga has joined Real Madrid’s growing injury list after injuring his thigh in Wednesday’s 2-0 Champions League defeat in Liverpool. ‘The player has been diagnosed with a muscular injury in the biceps femoris of his left leg. His progress will be monitored,’ Real Madrid said in a statement without revealing the length of his absence. According to Spanish press reports Camavinga, who already injured his knee last September, is expected to be sidelined for between two and three weeks. The 22-year-old came off in the 56th minute with the same injury which has kept teammate Vinicius Junior out of action for several weeks. Madrid have various players out injured for long periods, including Dani Carvajal and Eder Militao with severe knee injuries. According to several Spanish media reports Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Brahim Diaz also finished the match in pain and will undergo medical tests on Friday. Champions League holders Real have lost three of their five matches and with six points they are currently 24th, the very last qualifying spot for the knockout phase.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/251567/camavinga-joins-real-madrid-injury-list
Attack-minded Spurs boss Postecoglou says: ‘You’ll miss me when I’m gone’,"Ange Postecoglou launched an impassioned defence of his attacking approach on Friday, saying he is “not interested” in pragmatism after Tottenham’s 2-2 draw with Roma -- the latest episode in an inconsistent season. Spurs were 2-1 up heading into added time at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium but veteran defender Mats Hummels snatched a late equaliser for Claudio Ranieri’s team. It came just days after Spurs hammered Premier League champions Manchester City 4-0 at the Etihad. Spurs are sixth in the English top flight ahead of Sunday’s match against mid-table Fulham, with six wins and five defeats so far this season. Australian coach Postecoglou said he would stick to his attacking principles despite his team’s slip-ups. “There’s plenty of room for pragmatism in all walks of life and in football as well,” he said at his pre-match press conference. “But I’m just not interested in it. “I don’t know why I need to change my approach to be like everyone else wants me to be. I’ll continue to push this team to be a little bit different, play football in a different way. “Maybe when I’m long gone you’ll all pine for my entertainment, and you’ll have had your fill of pragmatism. “But look, if we were pragmatic I’d say at 2-0 up at City away, we’d have probably settled for 2-0 and we wouldn’t have got the victory we did and made it a special moment for our club.” Postecoglou said his approach was geared towards long-term success for the club, who have not won silverware since 2008. “At the moment what do we have? We don’t have a hell of a lot,” he said. “We haven’t achieved anything yet, we haven’t had success, we haven’t done all those things we want to do. “So if I start being pragmatic now then maybe we’ll never get there. Last night we weren’t at our highest level but I thought for 20 minutes we were as exciting as we’ve been since I’ve been here... we were exciting to watch. And that’s what I want.” He hinted at potential signings in the January transfer window, saying he had spoken with technical director Johan Lange. “Last year, we ended up doing a little bit of business which I think helped us but nothing is concrete now because January is always tricky and a lot will be dependent on where we are squad-wise,” he said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/251566/attack-minded-spurs-boss-postecoglou-says-youll-miss-me-when-im-gone
"Arsenal must be near-perfect to catch Liverpool, says Arteta","Mikel Arteta says Arsenal will need to be almost perfect if they are to catch runaway Premier League leaders Liverpool but feels momentum is building again after a poor run. Arsenal, runners-up to Manchester City over the past two seasons, were expected to challenge again this year but instead Liverpool have raced eight points clear of second-placed City. The Gunners go into Saturday’s match against West Ham on a high after hammering Sporting Lisbon 5-1 in the Champions League in midweek. Last weekend they beat Nottingham Forest 3-0 at home to end a four-match winless run in the league that cost them vital ground. Victory at the London Stadium on Saturday would likely lift Arsenal to second in the table ahead of the Sunday matches, which includes a pivotal clash between Liverpool and City. Arteta was asked at his pre-match press conference on Friday whether his team would have to be almost flawless to stand any chance of catching Liverpool, who have won 10 of their 12 games. ‘If they continue that way, that’s for sure, with the numbers they’re producing and the amount of games they’re winning,’ said the Arsenal manager. ‘But the focus is on us, maintaining the consistency, especially in performances, that will give us the right to win a lot of games... this is a long run.’ He said he felt momentum was building at Arsenal again after the international break. ‘Winning lifts the energy and our confidence,’ he added. ‘They were two big wins for us and now it’s about consistency, getting that momentum, take it further against a good opponent tomorrow and try to replicate the performance to win the game.’ He added: ‘This is every three days so it doesn’t matter what you did yesterday, it’s about the next days, the next performance. Are you able to sustain high-level performance throughout the game as well because of how competitive every opponent is right now? And that’s what we will try to do tomorrow.’ Arsenal’s uptick in form has coincided with the return of captain Martin Odegaard, who spent two months on the sidelines with an ankle injury. Arteta said the ‘exceptional’ midfielder had hit the ground running since his return earlier this month. ‘Good players that are so consistent and so reliable, that can take the game to a different level and make the players better around them -- that’s a huge quality of Martin’s and he has been missed,’ he said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/251565/arsenal-must-be-near-perfect-to-catch-liverpool-says-arteta
‘Hot fight’ as unbeaten Bayern visit Dortmund,"Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel promised ‘a hot fight’ when unbeaten league leaders Bayern Munich visit the Westfalenstadion on Saturday. Bayern are already 10 points clear of fifth-placed Dortmund after just 11 games. The rare shining light in Dortmund’s stuttering season however has been their home form. In all competitions, Dortmund have won eight from eight at their 82,000-strong Westfalenstadion fortress, compared to just three wins in 10 away from home. Speaking on Wednesday after Dortmund’s 3-0 Champions League win at Dinamo Zagreb, Kobel readied himself and his team for ‘a hot fight in an incredible atmosphere.’ ‘We know what they can do, they’re incredibly strong. But we know what we can do as well.’ Bayern are six points clear in the league and are heavy favourites to reclaim the Bundesliga title, having let it slip for the first time in 11 years last season. England captain Harry Kane is in fine form, with 14 goals in 11 league games, while the red-hot Jamal Musiala has become a more regular scorer this term. ‘It’s harder to beat Bayern than it has been for a long time. Harry Kane has an incredible goal rate,’ said Dortmund defender Nico Schlotterbeck. Last season, Kane scored a hat-trick on his ‘Der Klassiker’ debut as Bayern won 4-0 in Dortmund. While their attack is clearly firing, Bayern’s recent run of form is built on resolute defence. Bayern have kept seven straight clean sheets dating back to October’s 4-1 thumping in Barcelona, a clear sign coach Vincent Kompany’s tweaks have taken effect. If Dortmund are to take something away from Saturday’s game, they will need to overturn a poor recent record against Bayern. Last season’s 2-0 win in Munich was Dortmund’s first league victory over Bayern since 2018. Those wins bookended a run of nine losses and one draw, with Bayern scoring 33 goals to Dortmund’s 11 in that time. Dortmund may also be without midfielder Julian Brandt, who was taken off at half-time in midweek with a thigh injury. Calling Brandt ‘extremely important’, coach Nuri Sahin said: ‘I hope he comes back quickly -- he’s almost irreplaceable for us.’ Elsewhere, Leverkusen travel to the German capital to take on Union Berlin on Saturday, while second-placed Eintracht Frankfurt play at Heidenheim on Sunday. Leipzig will look to get their season back on track when they host Wolfsburg. Equal on points with Bayern three rounds ago, Leipzig have lost twice and drawn once to fall back to the pack. Still just 20, Gittens has made a huge step forward this season to become one of Dortmund’s best attacking outlets while cementing his spot in the starting XI. Known for his dribbling and speed on the flanks, Englishman Gittens has become more of a scoring threat, particularly from long range. His dipping drive from the edge of the box put Dortmund in control of Wednesday’s tricky clash at Dinamo Zagreb, his fourth goal in five Champions League games. ‘It’s been an experience to play every game from the start,’ Gittens told the Bundesliga website. ‘I’ve been enjoying the journey. ‘It’s not easy to do it every week, every three days, but I’m getting used to it now and I just need to keep performing.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/251564/hot-fight-as-unbeaten-bayern-visit-dortmund
Brook’s 132 puts England on top against sloppy New Zealand,"A fearless Harry Brook slammed an unbeaten century to give England the upper hand in the first Test against an error-strewn New Zealand on day two in Christchurch on Friday. At stumps Brook was 132 not out with the visitors recovering from 71-4 to be 319-5, trailing the hosts by 29 runs and with five wickets in hand. Captain Ben Stokes was unbeaten on 37 after being dropped by Tom Latham on 30 -- New Zealand’s sixth dropped catch and the third by their skipper. After England’s woeful start the 25-year-old Brook, in partnership with Ollie Pope, went on the attack. Aided by luck from poor fielding and several edges sailing just wide or over slips, the pair belted 151 off 171 deliveries for the fifth wicket. ‘From where we were to where we are now, the boys are very happy,’ Pope said. New Zealand debutant Nathan Smith said it was vital the home side tidied up their fielding when they take the new ball on Saturday. ‘That wicket has enough bounce in it and with the new ball as well it will nip a little sharper,’ he said. ‘It’s really key that we’re nice and accurate with the new ball and take the chances when they come.’ Brook was dropped four times -- on 18, 41, 70 and 106 -- with the last detected by television replays after a spill by wicketkeeper Tom Blundell. England’s batting onslaught came as the cloud cover which aided the New Zealand seamers in the first session gave way to blue skies. New Zealand, 319-8 overnight, were all out for 348 and then reduced England to 45-3 by lunch. When Ben Duckett went for 46 after lunch England were on the ropes at 71-4, but it would be 30 overs before New Zealand claimed their next wicket. Pope was on 77 with eight fours to his credit when he slashed at a wide delivery from Tim Southee and a diving Glenn Phillips grabbed a stunning one-handed catch. Phillips threw his arms in the air in celebration, in stark contrast to when he put his head in his hands earlier after Devon Conway dropped Brook off his bowling. In the early cloudy conditions the New Zealand seamers were in their element with plenty of movement. A Matt Henry delivery that nipped in trapped Zak Crawley lbw without scoring. Smith followed with an angled delivery to Jacob Bethell which was edged to Blundell and England’s debutant was gone for 10. Four balls later, of which two were no-balls, a similar angled delivery cramped Joe Root -- in his 150th Test -- for room and it deflected off his pads and on to the stumps for a duck. Duckett refused to be subdued and chanced his arm at anything loose. He was dropped by Latham on 23 and survived two inside-edges before he pulled a rising Will O’Rourke delivery to Conway waiting on the boundary. In the following over Brook was dropped for the first time and momentum began to shift in England’s favour. The partnership with Pope galloped along at five an over and Brook brought up is seventh Test century steering a Tim Southee delivery past backward point to the boundary. New Zealand had added a further 29 runs to their overnight score, the bulk of them by Phillips. He ended unbeaten on 58, his fifth half-century and the second-highest New Zealand score behind Kane Williamson’s 93. Brydon Carse finished with 4-64, the best figures for England, after taking both wickets to fall on the second morning. With his first ball of the day he had Southee caught on the boundary for 15, then ended the hosts’ innings by bowling O’Rourke for a duck.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251563/brooks-132-puts-england-on-top-against-sloppy-new-zealand
Barca coach says Yamal ready to return for Las Palmas game,"Barcelona coach Hansi Flick on Friday said teenage winger Lamine Yamal will return after three weeks out with injury for this weekend’s game against Las Palmas in La Liga. The 17-year-old has been sidelined since early November with an ankle problem and Barcelona have picked up just one point from the two league games he missed in that time. ‘Lamine Yamal is back and he’s ready to play. We haven’t decided yet if he’ll start, but he will play,’ Flick told reporters ahead of Saturday’s game. Yamal has scored six times in 16 total appearances this season and provided eight assists. Table-toppers Barcelona have failed to win any of the three matches he has not started in La Liga, losing 4-2 to Osasuna in September when he was on the bench. Barcelona are four points clear of Real Madrid but have played a game more than the defending champions. Flick also said Uruguayan defender Ronald Araujo is nearing a comeback after undergoing surgery in July for a hamstring injury he sustained while playing for his country at the Copa America.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/251562/barca-coach-says-yamal-ready-to-return-for-las-palmas-game
"Hojlund gives Amorim winning Old Trafford bow, Roma hold Spurs","Manchester United marked Ruben Amorim’s first game at Old Trafford with a 3-2 Europa League victory over Bodo/Glimt as Rasmus Hojlund netted a double, while Tottenham were held by Roma on Thursday. United trailed late in the first half against Norwegians Bodo/Glimt, but recovered to post a second straight Europa League win since sacking Erik ten Hag, having started the campaign with three consecutive draws. ‘Half of the stadium doesn’t know me, I came from Portugal and I did nothing for this club. Yet the way they make me feel at home is special,’ Amorim told TNT Sports. Manchester United scored in the second minute of former Sporting Lisbon boss Amorim’s first match as manager at Ipswich on Sunday and it took under 60 seconds for them to break the deadlock against Bodo/Glimt. Visiting goalkeeper Nikita Haikin was put under pressure by a poor back-pass and his clearance was blocked by Hojlund, allowing Alejandro Garnacho to tap into an empty net. But United’s defensive frailties were laid bare as Hakon Evjen swept in a 19th-minute equaliser and Philip Zinckernagel put Bodo/Glimt in front four minutes later. United looked short of ideas until the stroke of half-time when Noussair Mazraoui’s cross found Hojlund, who flicked the ball up with a clever touch and calmly volleyed into the bottom corner. The hosts reclaimed the lead less than five minutes after the restart, as Manuel Ugarte squared the ball across the face of goal for Hojlund to prod home. United survived a real scare when the referee waved play on after goalkeeper Andre Onana handled outside his area in the second half. But Amorim’s men held on to give their new boss a satisfactory home debut. In London, Spurs failed to back up their stunning weekend win over Manchester City as Mats Hummels scored in injury time to snatch a 2-2 draw for Roma. Tottenham also made a fast start as Son Heung-min slotted in a penalty in the fifth minute after Pape Matar Sarr was brought down by Hummels. Evan Ndicka flicked in Paulo Dybala’s free-kick to level for Roma a quarter of an hour later, before Brennan Johnson restored Spurs’ advantage 11 minutes before the break. Crisis-hit Roma piled the pressure on late at the Tottenham Stadium and former Germany centre-back Hummels pounced from close range in added time. Ange Postecoglou’s Spurs now sit outside the top eight, who qualify automatically for the last 16, on goal difference. ‘We should have shown a bit more composure,’ said Postecoglou. ‘We had a couple of chances cleared off the line. We sort of kept them in the game.’ Earlier, Athletic Bilbao cruised to a 3-0 win over Elfsborg to move behind Lazio on goal difference at the top of the table. The Roman club were held to a goalless draw by Ludogorets but remain unbeaten with 13 points from five games. Eintracht Frankfurt, also flying high in the Bundesliga, have the same number of points after Omar Marmoush netted a spot-kick in a 2-1 victory over Midtjylland in Denmark. Victor Osimhen scored his seventh goal in as many matches for Galatasaray in all competitions, but the Turkish giants slipped two points behind the leading trio after a 1-1 draw at AZ Alkmaar. Lyon climbed into seventh courtesy of a 4-1 thrashing of Qarabag in Baku, with Georgia striker Georges Mikautadze netting an excellent double. The Ligue 1 club sit above eighth-placed Rangers on goal difference after the Scottish giants, struggling domestically, thumped Nice 4-1 on the French Riviera. Chelsea remained top of the Conference League table with a fourth straight win by beating Heidenheim, who lost their 100-percent record, 2-0. A much-changed Chelsea had to wait until six minutes after the restart to break the deadlock as Christopher Nkunku took a brilliant touch to control Jadon Sancho’s cross before firing into the top corner. The German side improved after falling behind, though, and almost equalised in the 69th minute when Chelsea goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen produced a wonderful double save to deny Paul Wanner and Leo Scienza. The two-time European champions killed the game off with four minutes left as Sancho notched his second assist of the match, teeing up Mykhailo Mudryk to drive a shot into the roof of the net after playing a one-two with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/251561/hojlund-gives-amorim-winning-old-trafford-bow-roma-hold-spurs
Tamim propels Bangladesh to win over Afghanistan,"Defending champions Bangladesh secured a 45-run win against their Afghanistan counterparts in the Under-19 Asia Cup opener at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Friday. Azizul Hakim Tamim played the captain’s knock, smashing a brilliant 133-ball 103 with Kalam Siddiki Aleen contributing 66 to help Bangladesh set 229 runs. Pace duo Al Fahad (3-36) and Iqbal Hossain Emon (3-40) each picked three wickets to restrict the Afghans to 183 runs in 47.5 overs. After being invited to bat first, junior Tigers found themselves in trouble when opener Zawad Abrar was dismissed for a duck by Abdul Aziz, who finished with 2-29. Then, skipper Azizul and Kalam forged a 142-run partnership to steady their ship until right-arm spinner Allah Mohammad Ghazanfar broke through to remove Kalam after 35.3 overs. Bangladesh continued to lose wickets at regular intervals, but Azizul held his nerve to complete his century, which included eight boundaries and four sixes. Apart from Aziz, Nasratullah Nooristani and Khatir Stanikzai also scalped two apiece. In defending the target, Bangladesh kept the batters in check, witnessing Afghanistan lose their last five wickets for just 13 runs. Faisal Khan Ahmadzai top-scored with 58 in 58 balls and Naseer Khan Maroofkhil made 34 runs for Afghans.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251560/tamim-propels-bangladesh-to-win-over-afghanistan-
Kings start kingly,"The last season’s treble winners Bashundhara Kings earned a 7-0 win over Chittagong Abahani in the one of the three opening day’s matches of the 10-team Bangladesh Premier League at the Kings Arena in the city on Friday. Mohammedan Sporting Club also got off to a flying start after a crushing 6-0 win over promoted Dhaka Wanderers at the Shaheed Barkat Stadium in Gazipur while Brothers Union beat Police Football Club 2-1 at the Birshreshtha Flight Lt Matiur Rahman Stadium in Munshiganj.

PlayStation creator says ‘everyone told us we would fail’,"The PlayStation has been a colossal consumer hit, but three decades ago, its creator Ken Kutaragi struggled to convince both game-makers and his bosses at Sony that his console would be a winner. ‘Everyone told us we would fail,’ Kutaragi told AFP in a rare interview. With revolutionary 3D graphics and grown-up titles like ‘Tomb Raider’ and ‘Metal Gear Solid’, the device first hit shelves on December 3, 1994. Before that, Nintendo’s NES console and similar gaming machines were considered ‘children’s toys’, the 74-year-old Kutaragi said. Popular games like ‘Super Mario Bros’ were two-dimensional, and computer-generated imagery (CGI) was a rarity even in Hollywood. ‘Most of the executives (at Sony) were fiercely opposed,’ fearing for the Japanese giant’s reputation as a producer of high-end electronics, Kutaragi said. Japanese game-makers gave a ‘frosty response’ too, as creating 3D games in real time seemed ‘unthinkable’ at the time. Films with CGI took one or two years to make in those days, with budgets of tens of millions of dollars, he said. But Kutaragi, then a Sony employee, was not deterred. ‘We wanted to make the most of technological progress to create a new form of entertainment,’ the engineer said, his eyes gleaming. His ambition paid off: the console — now in its fifth generation — became a household name. The PlayStation 2 was the world’s top-selling games console with 160 million units sold. Sony and fellow Japanese game giant Nintendo are industry rivals, but more than three decades ago they worked together to make a CD-ROM reader compatible with the Super Nintendo console, which could only take game cartridges. With Nintendo’s permission, Sony was also developing a machine capable of reading both CDs and cartridges, with the working title ‘Play Station’ — the first time the famous name was used. But the pair’s bonhomie ended dramatically. Hours after Sony unveiled its new project at a 1991 Las Vegas trade show, Nintendo, spooked by Sony’s rights over the games, announced it would team up with Dutch firm Philips instead. The episode was seen as a betrayal and humiliation for Sony, and all of these burgeoning projects failed to materialise. ‘Newspapers said it was bad for us,’ Kutaragi said. But ‘it was inevitable that we and Nintendo would follow our own paths, because our approaches were totally different’. For Nintendo, ‘video games were toys that had nothing to do with technology,’ he said. And without the snub, the PlayStation as we know it ‘would never have seen the light of day’. When Sony launched its PlayStation and CD games in Japan in 1994, and in Western countries some months later, Nintendo had a stranglehold on console sales. So Sony used its experience in the music industry to develop a new distribution model, selling the gadgets at electronics stores instead of toy stores and creating new supply chains adapted to local markets. Kutaragi eventually became vice president of Sony but left the conglomerate in 2007 after the launch of the PlayStation 3, which initially struggled commercially. Now the future of the console market is less rosy as ‘cloud gaming’ grows in popularity, something that Kutaragi also predicted — along with mobile gaming years in advance. ‘I’d often reflect on the future of technology, over 10 or 20 years, to predict new trends,’ although ‘many people found that hard to understand’, he said. The engineer now runs a start-up focused on robotics and artificial intelligence and teaches at a Japanese university. ‘We are entering a world where everything can be calculated’ by a computer with the help of AI, Kutaragi said. For example, generative AI chatbot ChatGPT ‘exists because language has become computable’, and similar technology is being used in sectors as diverse as medicine, music and visual art. ‘Imagine if time and space were also computable,’ he said. ‘For the moment, this is a possibility limited to the world of video games,’ but ‘imagine that we could move instantly to any place’, Kutaragi said. ‘What was once science fiction could become reality.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/251549/playstation-creator-says-everyone-told-us-we-would-fail
Black Friday targets inflation-weary US consumers,"The annual Black Friday shopping day has always been about finding the best deals, but this year retailers are preparing for a US consumer more zealously fixated than ever on getting value for their money. Inflation has stabilized after dramatic price spikes during the Covid pandemic years, but consumers are still feeling the pinch — meaning bargain-hunting strategies such as grabbing early giveaways and waiting for last-minute steals are in vogue. Compared with other years, holiday shoppers in 2024 are ‘even more preoccupied and very focused around value and discounts,’ said Vivek Pandya, leading insights analyst at Adobe Digital Insights. ‘We do see stronger price sensitivity on the part of the consumer and they are very responsive to deals and event-tie deals,’ he said. Consumers throughout 2024 have responded to special discount occasions such as Memorial Day and Amazon’s ‘Prime Day.’ Black Friday, the unofficial kickoff of the US holiday gift season, comes the day after Thanksgiving and opens a long commerce-centred weekend that also includes ‘Small Business Saturday’ and ‘Cyber Monday.’ In recent years, as inflation has grown as a concern, major chains like department store Target have been pulling ahead ‘Black Friday’ promotions to October or even earlier. Consumer prices on average were 22 per cent higher in August 2024 compared with January 2020, according to Pew Research, and popular discontent with inflation is one reason Donald Trump won the US presidency in November. Inflation also continues to guide retailer discounting decisions as they try to deliver what the market demands. At Target, shoppers have learned to turn out in force for the chain’s ‘Circle Week’ savings events held about once every quarter. That translates into less buying the week before and after, executives said. After a lengthy period of inflation, ‘consumers tell us their budgets remain stretched,’ Target CEO Brian Cornell told analysts earlier this month. ‘They’re becoming increasingly resourceful in their shopping behaviours, waiting to buy until (the) last moment of need, focusing on deals and then stocking up when they find them,’ he said. The National Retail Federation has projected holiday spending growth of between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent in the 2024 season compared with the year-ago period, to as much as $989 billion over the two-month period. Economists have pointed to an easing of gasoline prices as a supportive factor, along with an ebbing in the costs of some food items. The inflationary environment has weighed especially heavily on households with lower incomes, with banks pointing to rising charge-off rates as an indicator of increased stress. But some chains, such as off-price apparel retailer, Burlington Stores have pointed to improvement for this cohort of the population. Some of the chain’s strongest sales have been in stores in low-income zip codes, said Burlington chief executive Michael O’Sullivan. ‘Maybe for the first time since 2021, it looks like their real incomes are finally edging up,’ O’Sullivan said on a conference call this week. Thanksgiving, which is always the fourth Thursday in November, falls on its latest possible date in 2024. As a result, retailers are pivoting to a season with five fewer days than last year. Best Buy launched its Black Friday sale a week ahead of Thanksgiving this year. The electronics chain has also brought back ‘Doorbuster’ sales every Friday this year in stores and online — events many chains had phased out in recent years because of their association with hordes of waiting crowds that sometimes resulted in injury. On Wednesday, Adobe Digital Insights said that online sales through the first 24 days of the holiday season were up 9.6 per cent year-over-year, above the 8.4 per cent growth projected for the entire season. Pandya, the insights analyst, said the shorter season may be one reason for the outsized early sales, but that it also reflects how the competitiveness for online goods that drives down prices.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/trade-commerce/251548/black-friday-targets-inflation-weary-us-consumers
"Yen rallies, euro up on rising inflation data","The yen rallied against the dollar and the euro also advanced versus the US unit Friday as traders reacted to news of higher inflation in Japan and the eurozone. European and Asian stock markets traded mixed before Wall Street reopens from a break Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday, and as consumers in the United States and elsewhere sought Black Friday bargains. Traders closed out a rollercoaster month for assets caused largely by Donald Trump winning a second US presidential election — and also a result of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Markets are tracking in particular developments surrounding Trump’s pledge to hammer China, Canada and Mexico with hefty tariffs on his first day in office in January. In Asia on Friday, ‘expectations for a rate hike by the Bank of Japan firmed up after a hotter than expected inflation print’, noted Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown. Forecast-busting consumer prices out of Tokyo boosted talk of another Japanese interest-rate hike next month, in turn sending the yen strengthening one per cent against the dollar. Consumer prices in Tokyo — seen as a bellwether for Japan as a whole — jumped to 2.6 per cent in November, well up from October and much more than expected. The Bank of Japan has hiked interest rates twice this year, while the yen was being supported also by forecasts that the Federal Reserve will lower US rates at its December meeting. The BoJ lifted rates in March for the first time in 17 years followed by a second increase in July. The stronger yen Friday weighed on Japanese exporters, causing the Tokyo stock market to close lower. Hong Kong and Shanghai gained after Chinese authorities held a meeting to discuss plans to boost stunted consumption in China — a key goal for Beijing as it looks to kickstart the world’s number two economy. In Europe, the euro firmed against the dollar as official data showed the eurozone’s annual inflation rate rebounded further in November on resilient energy prices. Year-on-year consumer price increases reached 2.3 per cent, the EU’s official data agency said, continuing to bounce back from a three-year low of 1.7 per cent in September. Analysts said the latest reading was not expected to deter the European Central Bank from cutting interest rates next month as it focuses on addressing Europe’s sluggish growth. Eurozone assets remained under pressure owing to uncertainty over budget cuts to reduce France’s huge deficit, and as prime minister Michel Barnier’s government struggles amid tough opposition from the right and left. Economic weakness in Germany in particular has also dampened enthusiasm for the euro. London’s stock market and pound were little changed heading into the weekend. The Bank of England on Friday warned that growing geopolitical tensions pose a ‘significant’ risk to banks and broader financial stability. A half-yearly report from the BoE on risks to the financial system did not mention Trump, but noted the potential for ‘increased global fragmentation’ of trade amid a broad range of geopolitical issues. In commodities trading, oil prices slipped Friday with the OPEC+ alliance having postponed a meeting planned for this weekend until Thursday, with analysts saying there were signs of disagreement among the group over plans to increase output. Bitcoin was sitting at about $97,500, having suffered a big drop at the start of the week.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/251547/yen-rallies-euro-up-on-rising-inflation-data
India GDP growth slows to 5.4pc in Sept quarter,"India’s economic growth slowed to 5.4 per cent year-on-year in the September quarter, official data showed Friday, a significant decline from the 6.7 per cent during the previous quarter. Friday’s figure still places the world’s most populous country among the fastest-growing major economies globally, but suggests a moderation in breakneck expansion seen over the past year. The data is likely to put pressure on the Reserve Bank of India to cut interest rates after holding them steady at 6.50 per cent for more than 18 months. The latest growth data could now spur the bank to start cutting rates this year. Year-on-year gross domestic product came in much below most analyst estimates. The Indian economy had expanded 6.7 per cent year-on-year in the previous April-June quarter. A government statement laid blame for the lower than expected growth figures on sluggish manufacturing and mining activity. The moderation in economic growth is also unwelcome news for Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which failed to secure an outright mandate in this year’s general elections, leaving it reliant on coalition parties to govern. Its two biggest allies have reportedly sought billions of dollars in financial assistance for infrastructure projects in their states. Modi’s government pledged in its post-election budget to spend $24 billion on employment and training to address uneven economic growth and mollify disgruntled voters. Rising food costs in India have added to Modi’s political troubles and also prevented the central bank from shifting to a dovish stance on inflation. While India posted world-beating growth of 8.2 per cent in the year to March, the International Monetary Fund expected the pace to cool to 7 per cent for the 2024-25 financial year.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/251546/india-gdp-growth-slows-to-5.4pc-in-sept-quarter
DNCRP conducts drives in 21 districts,"In a bid to ensure price stability and a steady supply of essential goods, the Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection has conducted market drives across 21 districts, imposing fines of Tk 4,70,500 on 61 businesses for various irregularities. In a media release, the DNCRP said that Thursday’s operations focused on key essential items like potatoes, vegetables, eggs, broiler chickens, lentils, onions, garlic, ginger and edible oils. Special task forces spearheaded the initiative and have conducted drives in Dhaka Metropolitan areas and other districts simultaneously. In Dhaka, seven teams led by DNCRP officials inspected markets and oversaw pricing compliance. Across the country, a total of 32 teams carried out similar monitoring activities. The market monitoring drive aimed to address irregularities and prevent unfair practices amid rising concerns about essential commodity prices.

WTO chief reappointed as Trump threat looms,"World Trade Organisation chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was reappointed Friday for a second term, in the shadow of the coming return of Donald Trump and his disdain for international trade rules. Okonjo-Iweala, the first woman and the first African to head the WTO, was the only candidate in the race, and had been all but assured a second term. The organisation’s 166 members ‘today agreed to give incumbent Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala a second term as director-general,’ the WTO said in a statement. The 70-year-old Nigerian’s reappointment was approved by consensus during a special meeting of the organisation’s General Council, held behind closed doors, the WTO said. Her current term ends in August 2025, and the appointment process for the next  mandate had initially been scheduled to take months. But with Okonjo-Iweala the only candidate, African countries called for the process to be speeded up, officially to facilitate preparations for the WTO’s next big ministerial conference, set to be held in Cameroon in 2026. The unstated objective is to ‘accelerate the process, because they did not want Trump’s team to come in and veto her as they did four years ago’, said Keith Rockwell, a senior research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation. The common practice of appointing directors-general by consensus made it possible in 2020 for Trump to block Okonjo-Iweala’s appointment for months, forcing her to wait to take the reins until after President Joe Biden entered the White House in early 2021. The overwhelming support for Okonjo-Iweala’s second term came ‘not so much (because) everyone loves Ngozi’, a source close to the discussions told AFP. Rather, members were ‘worried that if she doesn’t get reinstated, then it’s possible that the administration in Washington would slow things (or) block other contenders’, leaving a void at the top, the source said. ‘The alternative of no-one leading the organisation is unacceptable to them.’ Rockwell, a former WTO spokesman, told AFP that speeding up Okonjo-Iweala’s reappointment ‘creates tensions in the relationship with the United States, for sure — tensions which would probably have been there under any circumstances, but now this raises the stakes’. During Trump’s first term, the WTO faced relentless attacks from his administration, which crippled the organisation’s dispute settlement appeal system, and also threatened to pull the United States out of the organisation altogether. And Trump has already signalled he is preparing to launch all-out trade wars, threatening to unleash a flurry of tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico on his first day in office on January 20. ‘The festival of tariffs announced to date shows that he has no intention of following any rules,’ said Elvire Fabry, a researcher at the Institut Jacques Delors think-tank. ‘The United States would not even need to withdraw from the WTO,’ she told AFP. ‘They are freeing themselves from the WTO rules’. In this context, the WTO chief will have ‘a fire-fighter role’, she said. It will be a question of ‘saving what can be saved, and making the case that there is no real alternative to the WTO rules’, said another source close to the discussions on speeding up Okonjo-Iweala’s reappointment. ‘It will be a very difficult mandate, with little certainty about what will happen.’ Rockwell noted that the WTO’s problems were not solely linked to Washington. ‘It is a time right now in which application of the WTO rules has deteriorated,’ he said. ‘You can’t blame all of this on the United States. That’s true of many other members as well.’ Dmitry Grozoubinski, author of the book ‘Why Politicians Lie about Trade’, agreed. ‘Governments are increasingly turning to trade measures to address issues like national security, environmental competition, and re-industrialisation, and policymakers aren’t as moved as they once were by arguments that their ideas violate the letter or spirit of WTO commitments,’ he told AFP. ‘If president-elect Trump makes destroying the WTO a priority,’ he said, the organisation’s ‘options will be limited as the institution is not built to withstand overt demolition from within its membership’. Since taking the WTO reins, Okonjo-Iweala has tried to breathe new life into the fragile organisation, pushing for fresh focus on areas like climate change and health. But pressure is growing for WTO reform, in particular of the moribund appeals portion of its dispute settlement system, which collapsed during the first Trump presidency as Washington blocked the appointment of judges.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/trade-commerce/251544/wto-chief-reappointed-as-trump-threat-looms
Thousands in Italy strike over low purchasing power and pay,"Thousands of Italians took part in a general strike Friday to protest low wages and purchasing power, although its impact on transport was limited. The strike, called by two union confederations, was set to last eight hours in all sectors except transport, where far-right transport minister Matteo Salvini ordered it halved it to four hours. The country’s main union — the left-wing CGIL — and the centrist UIL called the strike in protest at the draft 2025 budget tabled by the hard-right government of prime minister Giorgia Meloni, calling it ‘totally unsuitable to resolve the country’s problems’. They want to see ‘an increase in purchasing power for employees and retired people, as well as funding for health, education, public services and industrial policies’, the CGIL said in a statement. Italy, like France, has been singled out by the European Union for its huge deficit. It is under intense pressure to balance the books and slash its huge public debt, which is currently hovering at around three trillion euros ($3.2 trillion). Meloni’s government has committed to reducing the public deficit to 2.8 per cent of gross domestic product from 2026 –- below the ceiling of 3.0 per cent of GDP set by the European Union. The tough target will require cuts in tax rebates and budget cuts for many ministries and public services. Italy’s second-largest union, the centre-right CSIL, did not taking part in the strike. CSIL boss Luigi Sbarra on Thursday called it a ‘sterile, demagogic, populist protest’ at a time when the draft budget has not yet been finalised. The eight-hour stoppage affected numerous private and public sectors, including education, industry, healthcare, post office services and courts. The limited strike for public bus, metro and tram services lasted just four hours, from 9:00am (0800 GMT) to 1:00pm. The shorter time was ordered by minister Salvini — also Meloni’s deputy prime minister — under a law that limits strike time to maintain minimum service. The national airline ITA cancelled 109 flights Friday, including 18 international ones, while Ryanair cancelled ‘a small number of flights’. Besides Rome, thousands of people demonstrated in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Palermo. ‘The government has betrayed everything it told its voters,’ in particular that ‘it would have improved the conditions of workers,’ the CGIL’s Daniele Canti told AFPTV at the demonstration in the capital. Train transport was not affected as rail workers downed tools at the weekend and Italian law prevents them striking again for at least 12 days.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/251543/thousands-in-italy-strike-over-low-purchasing-power-and-pay
Salehuddin for inclusive public financial management reform,"Finance adviser Salehuddin Ahmed on Friday underscored the need for a triangular approach to public financial management or PFM, integrating the efforts of the public sector, private sector and citizens to ensure efficient, transparent and accountable financial services. ‘In our country, the main bottleneck is the institution itself. We have good programmes and plans, but we must focus on implementation by aligning these with our institutional capacity and commitment,’ he said while speaking as chief guest at ‘Review Workshop on the 3rd PFM Reform Strategy 2025-2030’ at a training centre in Gazipur, said a press release. The workshop, organised by the Finance Division with support from the World Bank, aimed to finalise technical notes based on insights gathered from 31 consultation workshops held in recent months. Finance secretary Md Khairuzzaman Mozumder presided over the event while Finance Division additional secretary and national programme director of e Strengthen Public Financial Management Programme to Enable Service Delivery, or SPFMS, Bilquis Jahan Rimi and lead governance specialist (financial management) of the World Bank Suraiya Zannath spoke on the occasion. Senior officials from the Finance Division, representatives from the World Bank, and other development partners participated in the event. Salehuddin Ahmed stressed that the upcoming reform strategy should be straightforward, actionable and tailored to address Bangladesh’s unique challenges. Khairuzzaman Mozumder highlighted the government’s achievements in public financial reform. He pointed out how automation in salary disbursement and pension management had enhanced  efficiency and transparency. ‘For instance, electronic fund transfers now ensure that salaries reach employees on the first day of each month, which used to take 8-9 days. Similarly, the pension management system has been automated, eliminating delays and ensuring life verification. These reforms have expanded into private domains, such as the government-to-person or G2P payment system, which supports corruption-free social safety net programmes,’ he added. According to the press release, public financial management is pivotal to Bangladesh’s vision of achieving fiscal discipline, macroeconomic stability and sustainable development. It provides a framework for strategic resource allocation across agriculture, industrialisation and services to drive inclusive growth. As Bangladesh prepares its third PFM reform strategy, it is essential to identify gaps in previous reforms and reflect on the effective use of public funds. This requires sequencing reforms into three types: process reforms for efficiency, structural reforms for modernisation and institutional reforms for strong governance. Adapting global best practices while considering Bangladesh’s unique context is key. The inclusion of a clear action plan within the strategy will ensure cost-effectiveness, clarity, and better implementation. Ownership and commitment to this strategy are crucial, as it represents a shared responsibility to manage public resources equitably and effectively for all citizens. With unity and determination, Bangladesh can build a robust PFM system that supports a prosperous and sustainable future.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/251542/salehuddin-for-inclusive-public-financial-management-reform
Bangladesh slips a notch in mobile internet speed: Ookla,"Bangladesh has slipped a notch in its global ranking for mobile internet speed performance, according to Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index. The country stood at 89th place out of 111 countries in Ookla’s mobile internet speed index for October. The country previously held the 88th position in September. The index highlighted that the average mobile internet download speed in Bangladesh decreased to 27.56 Mbps in October from 28.42 Mbps in September. Globally, United Arab Emirates held the top position of the list, offering the fastest mobile internet with an average speed of 428.53 Mbps in the reporting period. This is up from 413.14 Mbps, showing that UAE continues to provide high-speed internet to its users. Neighbouring country India also ranked high, holding the 26th position with an average download speed of 95.67 Mbps in October. India has remained in the same position it held in September, although the median download speed saw a slight increase from 91.72 Mbps. Among the other South Asian countries, Maldives is at 25th position, Pakistan at 100th, Sri Lanka at 103th and Afghanistan is at 111th position in terms of mobile internet speed. The October report did not include data from Myanmar. Bangladesh’s mobile network landscape is dominated by five major providers, namely Banglalink, Grameenphone, Robi, Airtel and Teletalk. Among them, Banglalink has emerged as the fastest internet provider. According to the report, 89 per cent of Banglalink’s tests showed a minimum download speed of at least 5 Mbps and an upload speed of at least 1 Mbps. In addition to mobile internet, Bangladesh also deteriorated in fixed broadband speed. The country has moved down three places to rank 101th globally among 158 countries, compared to its previous position of 108th. The report states that the median fixed broadband download speed in October was 48.06 Mbps compared with 48.38 Mbps reported in the previous month.

France arrests 26 as South Asian migrant trafficking ring smashed,"French authorities arrested 26 people and seized 11 million euros ($12 million) as they smashed a migrant trafficking ring suspected of bringing several thousand people from South Asia into France, border police said on Thursday. Charging between 15,000 and 26,000 euros per person, the traffickers are suspected of having smuggled several thousand people from India, Sri Lanka and Nepal into France since September 2021, the force said. Authorities estimate the network generated several million euros in illegal profits, which were laundered through construction companies, gold trafficking and informal transfers of money back to South Asia. The arrests took place between March and November 2024, said Julien Gentile, director of the French border force at Paris Charles De Gaulle airport. ‘The smugglers facilitated migrants’ travel to the European Union via Dubai or African states, while providing them with illegally obtained tourist, work or medical visas,’ said Gentile. The head of the network is still at large, with France’s request for his extradition from Dubai yet to be agreed, according to the border force. Of the 26 men arrested, 15 were placed in pre-trial detention with seven under judicial supervision. The remaining four, who were recently arrested, were to be presented on Thursday to the investigating judge. The 11 million euros’ worth of assets included properties, luxury cars, jewellery and gold. Those arrested are accused of belonging to different levels of the gang, ranging from smugglers to money launderers and shady finance brokers. ‘This is the exceptional nature of the case,’ Gentile added. Details of the investigation by France’s Office for the Fight against the Illicit Traffic of Migrants, were released with migration becoming a key issue for French political parties. The conservative government that took office in September has said it will clampdown, while France has also faced pressure over undocumented migrants crossing the Channel to Britain from its northern coast. Interior minister Bruno Retailleau was to visit the Calais region on Friday for talks with local mayors on the migrant crisis. At least 72 undocumented migrants have died this year trying to cross the Channel. The mayors have asked for more police and a tougher clampdown on the smuggling gangs. Retailleau is also to go to London on December 8-9 for talks on the migrants. Human trafficking carries a potential sentence of up to 20 years in France. In December 2023, a plane carrying hundreds of Indian passengers was grounded for days at Vatry airport east of Paris over concerns it was part of a human trafficking scheme. The plane had taken off from the United Arab Emirates and was detained after an anonymous tipoff.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/251539/france-arrests-26-as-south-asian-migrant-trafficking-ring-smashed
Macron unveils Notre Dame after restoration,"French president Emmanuel Macron on Friday inspected the gleaming restored interior of Notre Dame cathedral, saying workers had done the ‘impossible’ by healing a ‘national wound’ caused by a 2019 fire that ravaged the mediaeval landmark. Eight days ahead of the December 7 reopening of the cathedral, Macron conducted an inspection, broadcast live on television, which provided the first official insight into how the 850-year-old edifice now looks inside. ‘You have achieved what was thought impossible,’ Macron told workers and officials who packed Notre Dame after the French president toured the cathedral. ‘The blaze at Notre Dame was a national wound, and you have been its remedy through will, through work, through commitment,’ he said, adding the cathedral’s re-opening will be a ‘shock of hope.’ ‘This is an immense source of pride for the entire nation,’ Macron said, expressing hope that the spirit of ‘fraternity’ would endure. Notre Dame will welcome visitors and worshippers again over the December 7-8 weekend, after a sometimes challenging restoration to return the imposing Paris cathedral to its former glory after it was badly damaged by fire on April 19, 2019. World leaders are expected to attend but the guest list has yet to be revealed. The French president is hoping the re-opening of Notre Dame will be a major feather in his cap amid the current political deadlock following early parliamentary elections this summer. ‘We were told many times at the beginning that it wouldn’t be possible, that it was crazy, that it was arbitrary, that we were going to do it wrong,’ Macron said. ‘But in the end,’ he added, ‘you did it.’ Macron toured the key areas of the cathedral, including the nave, choir and chapel, and spoke to experts. ‘Sublime,’ said a visibly pleased Macron, who was accompanied by Paris’ archbishop Laurent Ulrich, the culture minister, the mayor of Paris and other officials. ‘It is much more welcoming,’ he added, praising Notre Dame’s pale-coloured stones and saying everyone involved in the reconstruction should ‘be proud’. After the devastating fire Macron set the ambitious goal to rebuild Notre Dame within five years and make it ‘even more beautiful’ than before, a target that the French authorities say has been met. The ‘building site of the century’ was a ‘challenge that many considered insane’, Macron has said. Some 250 companies and hundreds of experts were brought it for restoration work costing hundreds of millions of euros. All 2,000 people who contributed to the effort had been invited to Friday’s event. The restoration cost a total of nearly 700 million euros (more than $750 million at today’s rate). It was financed from the 846 million euros in donations that poured in from 150 countries in an unprecedented surge of solidarity. The 19th-century gothic spire has now been resurrected with an exact copy of the original, the stained windows have regained their colour, the walls shining after fire stains cleaned and a restored organ ready to thunder out again. Unseen to visitors is a new mechanism to protect against any future fires, a discreet system of pipes ready to release millions of water droplets in case of a new disaster. Notre Dame, which welcomed 12 million visitors in 2017, expects to receive an even higher figure of 14 to 15 million after the reopening, according to the church authorities. French ministers have also floated the idea of charging tourists an entrance fee to the site but the Paris diocese has said free admission was an important principle to maintain. Macron had hoped to speak inside Notre Dame to mark the reopening but after negotiations with the diocese, he was now set to speak in the forecourt only. France is by its constitution a secular country with a strict division between church and state. The next day, Sunday December 8, will see the first mass and consecration of the new altar. Macron said in December 2023 he had invited Pope Francis to the reopening of the cathedral but the head of the Catholic church announced in September, to the surprise of some observers, that he would not be coming. Instead, the pontiff is making a landmark visit during the subsequent weekend to the French island of Corsica. The French Catholic church has in recent years been rocked by a succession of sexual abuse allegations against clerics, including most recently the monk known as Abbe Pierre who became a household name for providing aid to the destitute. Over five years on, the investigation into what caused the fire is on-going, with initial findings backing an accidental cause such as a short circuit, a welder’s torch or a cigarette.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/251538/macron-unveils-notre-dame-after-restoration
"Assisted dying campaigners, opponents rally at UK parliament","Supporters and opponents of Britain’s assisted dying bill descended on the UK’s Westminster parliament Friday as lawmakers prepared to vote on the issue. Around 100 demonstrators wearing pink T-shirts and hats held placards reading ‘Give me choice over my death’, ‘My life my death my choice’ and ‘Dying people need choice’. A smaller number brandished their own placards with slogans such as ‘Don’t ask doctors to be killers’, and ‘Sort out care first’. ‘My brother has motor neurone disease. He is going to die an awful death and he wants to have the choice to die at a time of his choosing and when it is not so distressing to all those around him,’ London psychiatrist Graeme Lamb, 61, said. ‘The alternative is people are forced to take their own lives earlier,’ he said. Tighe Twomey, 62, a retired teacher from Cork city in Ireland said it was about autonomy for those faced dying in pain. ‘I think people should have a choice to decide if their lives are unbearable, to end their lives with dignity on their terms,’ he said. Opponents of the proposed legislation stood silently in a row near the gates to the parliament. Jude, a 37-year-old digital marketing worker said she worried about the sick and elderly succumbing to pressure to end their lives. ‘My mum is disabled and she already feels she is a burden,’ she said. ‘I think there would be a lot of people who would feel that their family think they are a burden and that their life is in the way of other people,’ she added. Another man who gave his name as James said he felt very strongly that doctors would be made into ‘killers’ if the bill became law. The 23-year-old from Luton, who preferred not to give his occupation, said there should be limits to what doctors are required to do when treating the terminally ill. He said they should ‘provide care, do all they can but not to the point of killing patients’. Linette, 53, a local government worker from London said her opposition was underpinned by her Christian faith but that she also feared any new law would be open to misuse and could end up being applied to others, not just the terminally ill. ‘I just believe that we have to treasure life in whatever form,’ she said. ‘I also believe that if this bill goes through it will be abused in years to come and it will be more readily available for others as well,’ she added. But supporter Lamb, whose brother has motor neurone disease, said he would argue that other issues should not stand in the way of the bill’s main objective. ‘It is about dignity. My brother cannot move. He has to be hoisted in and out of bed and various commodes and there comes a time when it is too much. He said he did not wish to prevent anyone else taking a different path at the end of their life. ‘I totally support people who make a different choice. All I want is for them not to impose their choice on the rest of us,’ he added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/251537/assisted-dying-campaigners-opponents-rally-at-uk-parliament
"Gaza in anarchy, says UN","The Gaza Strip has descended into anarchy, with hunger soaring, looting rampant and rising numbers of rapes in shelters as public order falls apart, the United Nations said on Friday. Palestinians are suffering ‘on a scale that has to be seen to be truly grasped’, Ajith Sunghay, head of the UN Human Rights Office in the Palestinian territories, said after concluding his latest visit to the devastated Palestinian territory. ‘This time I was particularly alarmed by the prevalence of hunger,’ Sunghay told a media briefing in Geneva, via video-link from Amman. ‘The breakdown of public order and safety is exacerbating the situation with rampant looting and fighting over scarce resources. ‘The anarchy in Gaza we warned about months ago is here,’ he said, calling the situation entirely predictable, foreseeable and preventable. Sunghay said young women, many displaced multiple times, had stressed the lack of any safe spaces or privacy in their makeshift tents. ‘Others said that cases of gender-based violence and rape, abuse of children and other violence within the community has increased in shelters as a consequence of the war and the breakdown of law enforcement and public order,’ he said. Sunghay described the situation in Gaza City as ‘horrendous’, with thousands of displaced people sheltering in ‘inhumane conditions with severe food shortages and terrible sanitary conditions’. He recounted seeing, for the first time, dozens of women and children in the besieged enclave now scavenging in giant landfills. The level of destruction in Gaza ‘just gets worse and worse’, he added. ‘The common plea by everyone I met was for this to stop. To bring this to an end. Enough.’ He said the UN was being blocked from taking any aid to the 70,000 people still thought to be living in northern Gaza, due to ‘repeated impediments or rejections of humanitarian convoys by the Israeli authorities’. ‘It is so obvious that massive humanitarian aid needs to come in — and it is not.’ UN Human Rights Office spokesman Jeremy Laurence called for an immediate ceasefire. ‘The killing must end,’ he said. ‘The hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally. Those arbitrarily detained must be released,’ he added. ‘And every effort must be made to urgently provide the full quantities of food, medicine and other vital assistance desperately needed in Gaza.’ Fighters from Palestinian group Hamas launched an attack in Israel on October 7, 2023, that resulted in the deaths of 1,207 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Israel’s retaliatory military offensive has killed 44,363 people in Gaza, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry that the UN considers reliable.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/251536/gaza-in-anarchy-says-un
Police in Georgia arrest dozens in clash with pro-EU protesters,"Police in Georgia arrested dozens of people overnight and early Friday in a violent crackdown on protests against the government’s decision to delay EU membership talks. The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the ruling party declared victory in October parliamentary elections that the pro-EU opposition decried as falsified. On Thursday night and Friday morning, riot police deployed rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons to disperse gatherings outside parliament in Tbilisi, beating peaceful protesters and journalists, an AFP reporter witnessed. The interior ministry said 32 of its staff were injured and ‘43 individuals were detained by law enforcement for disobeying lawful police orders and for petty hooliganism’. Thousands of people took the streets after prime minister Irakli Kobakhidze of the ruling Georgian Dream party announced the Caucasus country would not pursue membership of the European Union until 2028. The opposition has accused Georgian Dream of steering Tbilisi away from its long-held dream of joining the bloc and gravitating towards Russia. Two politicians from the opposition Coalition for Change, Elene Khoshtaria and Nana Malashkhia, were reportedly injured during the protests. Khoshtaria sustained a broken arm, while Malashkhia suffered a broken nose, the coalition said. Prominent poet Zviad Ratiani was among those arrested, the PEN writers’ association in Georgia said, demanding his immediate release. Ukraine said Friday it was ‘disappointed’ by Tbilisi’s decision to pause EU accession talks, accusing the Georgian government of trying to ‘please Moscow’. Opposition lawmakers are boycotting the new parliament, while Georgia’s pro-EU president Salome Zurabishvili has sought to annul the election results through the country’s constitutional court. The prime minister’s announcement to delay EU accession came hours after the European Parliament adopted a non-binding resolution rejecting the results of Georgia’s October 26 elections, alleging ‘significant irregularities’. The resolution called for a new vote within a year under international supervision and for sanctions to be imposed on top Georgian officials, including prime minister Kobakhidze. Accusing the European Parliament of ‘blackmail’, Kobakhidze said: ‘We have decided not to bring up the issue of joining the European Union on the agenda until the end of 2028.’ But he pledged to continue implementing reforms, adding: ‘By 2028, Georgia will be more prepared than any other candidate country to open accession talks with Brussels and become a member state in 2030.’ On Thursday, Georgian Dream MPs voted unanimously for Kobakhidze to continue as prime minister. But constitutional law experts say any decisions made by the new parliament are invalid, because it is still awaiting a court ruling on Zurabishvili’s bid to annul the election results. On Wednesday, the ruling party nominated far-right politician and former football international Mikheil Kavelashvili for the largely ceremonial post of president, further ratcheting up tensions. The former Soviet country officially gained EU candidate status in December 2023, an aspiration that is supported by 80 percent of the population, according to polling. But earlier this year Brussels froze Georgia’s accession process, citing the need for Tbilisi to address what it says is democratic backsliding.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/251535/police-in-georgia-arrest-dozens-in-clash-with-pro-eu-protesters
"Syria jihadists, allies shell Aleppo in shock offensive","Jihadists and their Turkish-backed allies shelled Syria’s second city Aleppo on Friday, in a major offensive against government troops that has sparked some of the deadliest fighting the country has seen in years. The violence has killed 255 people, according to a Syrian war monitor, most of them combatants on both sides but also including civilians. The toll also includes 24 civilians, most killed in Russian air strikes. The offensive began at a sensitive time for Syria and the region, with a fragile ceasefire between the Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel taking effect earlier this week in neighbouring Lebanon. By Friday, they had wrested more than 50 towns and villages in north and northwestern Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the biggest advances that anti-government factions had made in years. Army reinforcements have arrived in Aleppo, a Syrian government security official told AFP, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. The official added that ‘there are fierce battles and clashes west of Aleppo, but they have not reached the city’. This week, jihadists and factions backed by Turkey, which neighbours Syria and supported the rebellion against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, launched a major surprise offensive against government forces. They shelled a university student residence on Friday in government-held Aleppo, northern Syria’s main city, killing four civilians according to state media. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said ‘more than 14,000 people — nearly half are children — have been displaced’ by the violence. Aleppo resident Sarmad, 51, said he could hear ‘the sounds of missiles and artillery shelling around the clock’. ‘We’re scared that war will break out and we’ll be displaced from our homes again,’ he said. Nasser Hamdo, 36, who works in a pastry shop, said he had been glued to the news since hostilities began. The fighters had on Thursday cut the highway linking Aleppo to Syria’s capital Damascus, about 300 kilometres south, according to the Britain-based Observatory. ‘We’re worried that roads getting blocked could cause fuel prices to soar and prevent goods from reaching the city,’ Hamdo said. Syria’s civil war began when Assad’s forces cracked down in 2011 on pro-democracy protests. Since then, the conflict has killed more than 5,00,000 people, displaced millions and morphed into a complex war drawing in jihadists and foreign powers, including Assad allies Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday described the situation in Aleppo as ‘an infringement on the sovereignty of Syria.’ He expressed support for ‘the government of Syria to quickly restore order in this district and restore the constitutional order.’ At a press conference earlier this week, Mohamed Bashir of the jihadist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham said: ‘This operation aims to repel the sources of fire of the criminal enemy from the frontlines.’ HTS, led by al-Qaeda’s former Syria branch, controls swathes of the Idlib region as well as small parts of neighbouring Aleppo, Hama and Latakia provinces. The Idlib area where the jihadists are based has been subject to a Turkey and Russia-brokered truce since 2020. The ceasefire has been repeatedly violated but had largely been holding. An AFP correspondent based in rebel-held areas saw jihadists advancing in tanks as intense exchanges of fire took place in an area just seven kilometres from the city of Aleppo. AFP images showed damaged and abandoned Syrian army tanks and other military vehicles in the region. The correspondent said the jihadists and their Turkey-backed allies took orders from a joint military operations command. Analyst Nick Heras, of the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy, said the fighters were ‘trying to pre-empt the possibility of a Syrian military campaign in the region of Aleppo’. According to Heras, the Syrian government and its key backer Russia had been preparing for such a campaign. Russia intervened in Syria’s civil war in 2015, turning the momentum of the conflict in favour of the president, whose forces at the time had lost control of most of country. Turkey, Heras said, may be ‘sending a message to both Damascus and Moscow to back down from their military efforts in northwest Syria’. Other interests are also at stake. As well as Russia, Assad has been propped up by Iran and allied militant groups, including Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah. Iran-backed militias have a heavy presence in the Aleppo region after providing crucial ground support to the army in its recapture of rebel-held districts of the city in 2016. Anti-government forces are, according to Heras, ‘in a better position to take and seize villages than Russian-backed Syrian government forces, while the Iranians are focused on Lebanon’. During its war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israel intensified its strikes on Iran-backed groups in Syria including Hezbollah. Rami Abdel Rahman, director of the Observatory, said Assad’s forces ‘were totally unprepared’ for the attack. ‘It is strange to see regime forces being dealt such big blows despite Russian air cover and early signs that HTS was going to launch this operation,’ Abdel Rahman said. ‘Were they depending on Hezbollah, which is now busy in Lebanon?’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/251534/syria-jihadists-allies-shell-aleppo-in-shock-offensive

India closely monitoring situation of minorities in Bangladesh: Jaishankar,"Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has said the High Commission of India in Dhaka continues to monitor the situation related to the minorities in Bangladesh closely. The primary responsibility for the protection of life and liberty of all citizens of Bangladesh, including minorities, rests with the government of Bangladesh, he said while responding to five specific questions at the Indian Lok Sabha on Friday. The Lok Sabha is composed of public representatives chosen by direct election on the basis of Universal Adult Suffrage. Jaishankar said the government of India has seen several reports of incidents of violence against Hindus and other minorities, their homes and business establishments and of attacks on temples/ religious places, including in the month of August 2024, across Bangladesh. He said the Indian government has taken a ‘serious note’ of these incidents and shared its concerns with the Bangladesh government. Reports of attacks on temples and puja mandaps also came to light during the recent Durga Puja festival in Bangladesh, Jaishankar said. He said the government of India had expressed its ‘serious concerns’ regarding the attack on a Puja mandap in Tantibazar, Dhaka and theft at the Jashoreshwari Kali temple in Satkhira during Durga Puja 2024.

"BNP will not accept anarchy in names of ISKCON, religion: Fakhrul","Bangladesh Nationalist Party secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Friday said that his party will not accept any anarchy in the name of ISKCON or religion in the country. Referring to the incident of killing lawyer Saiful Islam Alif in Chattogram, he said, ‘I am scared when we see a lawyer get killed in the name of ISKCON and religion when we are dreaming  about a new Bangladesh.’ His statement came while he was addressing a student convention programme arranged by Thakurgaon Chhatra Parishad in Dhaka, at the auditorium of Krishibid Institution Bangladesh in the capital. He also said, ‘I would be happy if the anti-discrimination students came out on the streets, protesting such incidents.’ Fakhrul said that the fascists from across the border were trying to prove Bangladesh a fundamentalist country in the eyes of the world by hatching new conspiracies. And the media of neighbouring countries is assisting in these plots. He called on the student community to remain vigilant against any plots to snatch the victory achieved by Bangladesh. He said, ‘We all have to be vigilant so that the country does not fall into darkness again.’ Saying that ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina had to flee the country, the BNP secretary general said that her example should be publicised more and more to spread the message that those who practised the politics of killing would have to face the fate as she did. Referring to the recent incidents of clashes in some colleges in Dhaka, Fakhrul said that these incidents were the result of a conspiracy and were in no way acceptable. ‘We achieved a great victory through a bloody movement, and we do not want to lose the victory,’ he said. At other event on the day, the party’s standing committee member Nazrul Islam Khan urged all political parties to unite and fight against fascism. Nazrul gave the call while speaking as the chief guest at a discussion arranged by Bangladesh Khalafat Andolan marking its 43rd founding anniversary at the National Press Club in Dhaka. ‘Those who are fighting against fascism in Bangladesh must unite. It is not possible to defeat fascism without a united fight,’ Nazrul said. ‘We have a responsibility to restore democracy in the country. The blood sacrifice of those who gave their lives for democracy cannot be dishonoured,’ he said. The BNP leader also said, ‘The responsibility of an interim government is to arrange fair elections in which the opinions of the people will be accurately reflected.’ Nazrul further said that starting from the 1952 language movement to the 1990 anti-dictatorship movement, people had shed blood, but time and time again they endured one-party rule, military dictatorship, and the murder of democracy. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness, widely known as ISKCON, is a Hindu religious organisation with centres across the world, including Bangladesh. Its name has come to the forefront after one of its former member Chinmoy Krishna Das has recently been arrested in a sedition case.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/251531/bnp-will-not-accept-anarchy-in-names-of-iskcon-religion-fakhrul
UAE releases 75 more expats arrested over July protest,"The United Arab Emirates on Friday released 75 more Bangladeshi nationals who were arrested for holding protests in that country, expressing solidarity with the Student Movement Against Discrimination in July-August.

Minority communities more secure under interim govt: VOA survey,"Minority community people are more secure under the incumbent interim government compared with how they lived under the ousted Awami League government, revealed a survey by the Voice of America on Thursday.

Sammilito Parishad names Abul Kalam as panel leader for BGMEA elections,"The managing director and chief executive officer of Chaity Group, Md Abul Kalam, has been officially announced as the panel leader of Sammilito Parishad, a major group representing the country’s garment manufacturers. The announcement was made on Thursday at an event held at a city hotel in Dhaka, ahead of the upcoming elections for the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. Among those present at the event were former BGMEA presidents Faruque Hassan, Redwan Ahmed, Mostofa Golam Quddus, Kazi Moniruzzaman, SM Fazlul Hoque, and Khandoker Rafiqul Islam. Sammilito Parishad and Forum, another panel, are traditional rivals in BGMEA elections, vying for control of the apex body of Bangladesh's apparel sector. Earlier, on October 20, the Ministry of Commerce dissolved BGMEA's Board of Directors in accordance with Section 17 of the Trade Organisations Act, 2022. The ministry appointed Md Anwar Hossain, vice-chairman of the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), as the administrator of BGMEA. According to the ministry’s announcement, the administrator will oversee the holding of free and fair elections within 120 days and will hand over the responsibilities to the newly elected BGMEA leadership. On August 24, Designtex Group managing director Khandoker Rafiqul Islam was elected president of BGMEA following the resignation of SM Mannan Kochi. Mannan Kochi, a member of Sammilito Parishad, had been elected BGMEA president for the 2024-26 term on March 14. After his resignation, BGMEA’s board selected Rafiqul Islam to serve for the remainder of the term. In August, a group of BGMEA members led by Forum, another panel, demanded the dissolution of the current BGMEA board. They cited the board’s failure to provide adequate guidance to members during challenging times, including student protests, government instability, labour unrest, and flooding. The group also alleged irregularities in the BGMEA election held earlier this year, claiming that Kochi had close ties with the ousted prime minister and had been involved in suppressing student protests during the July-August unrest. Earlier, another election-centric panel of BGMEA namely Forum on November 20 announced Rising Group managing director Mahmud Hasan Khan as panel leader for the upcoming elections of the trade body.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/apparel/251521/sammilito-parishad-names-abul-kalam-as-panel-leader-for-bgmea-elections
Irish voters votes cast ballot in closely fought general election,"Voting got under way in Ireland on Friday in a general election in which the two centre-right coalition partners are neck-and-neck with opposition party Sinn Fein. Polls opened at 0700 GMT and will close at 2200 GMT as voters choose new members of the 174-seat lower chamber of parliament, the Dail. Final opinion polling put the three main parties -- centre-right Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, and the leftist-nationalist Sinn Fein -- each on around 20 percent. Counting is not due to start until Saturday morning, with partial results expected throughout the day. A final result, however, may not be clear for days as EU member Ireland’s proportional representation system sees votes of eliminated candidates redistributed during multiple rounds of counting. Prime Minister Simon Harris was one of the first to vote, casting his ballot in his constituency of Delgany, south of Dublin. The Fine Gael leader, who became Ireland’s youngest-ever taoiseach (prime minister) when he took over in April, held a solid lead entering the campaign. But the party lost its advantage after Harris was seen in a viral clip appearing rude and dismissive to a care worker on the campaign trail. ‘I’ve enjoyed putting forward my policy vision as a new leader, as a new Taoiseach,’ Harris, 38, told reporters after voting. ‘Now I’m looking forward to the people having their say.’ Some in his constituency did not share his optimism. IT worker Kevin Barry, 41, said he was unsure about voting ‘as all the options seem so terrible’. While leaning towards the governing coalition, Barry told AFP: ‘I am not really happy with them as they are responsible for the mess that we are in, particularly with regard to housing.’ For Peta Scott, 54, a healthcare worker and mother of four, housing woes meant it was ‘a challenge’ for her children to stay in Ireland. In north Dublin, Deric Sweeman, a 55-year-old truck driver, said he voted for Sinn Fein. ‘It’s time for a change... Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have had enough to fix it and they have not done it,’ he added. Housing and infrastructure improvements need to be the priorities for the next government, he said. At the last general election in 2020, Sinn Fein -- the former political wing of the paramilitary Irish Republican Army -- won the popular vote but could not find willing coalition partners. That led to weeks of horsetrading, ending up with Fine Gael, which has been in power since 2011, agreeing a deal with Fianna Fail, led by the experienced Micheal Martin, 64. The role of prime minister rotated between the two party leaders. The smaller Green Party made up the governing coalition. Harris has had to defend the government’s patchy record on tackling a worsening housing crisis and fend off accusations of profligate public spending. A giveaway budget last month was also aimed at appeasing voters fretting about sky-high housing and childcare costs. Both centre-right parties stress their pro-business credentials and say returning them to power would ensure stability, particularly with turmoil abroad and the risk of external shocks. Ireland’s economy depends on foreign direct investment and lavish corporate tax returns from mainly US tech and pharma giants. But threats from incoming US president Donald Trump to slap tariffs on imports and repatriate corporate tax of US firms from countries such as Ireland have caused concern for economic stability. Mary Lou McDonald’s Sinn Fein has seen a dip in support because of its progressive stance on social issues and migration policy, as immigration became a key election issue. But it has rallied on the back of a campaign heavily focused on housing policy and claims it is the only alternative to the Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, who have swapped power since Irish independence from Britain in 1921. In McDonald’s Dublin central constituency, retiree William McCarthy voted Sinn Fein but did not think they would win. Physiotherapist Jenny Foley, 28, voted for the smaller centre-left Social Democrats because of their immigration policy and pro-choice stance, with abortion legalised in Ireland in 2018. ‘I am really interested in candidates who are not on the side of closing Ireland’s borders. I’m really not a fan of all of that,’ she added. Independents could play a role in the formation of the next government if Fine Gael and Fianna Fail fall short of an 88-seat majority.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/251520/irish-voters-votes-cast-ballot-in-closely-fought-general-election
"Govt seizes 40,000 Kg polythene in anti-polythene campaign","Bangladesh interim government is intensifying its efforts to enforce the ban on polythene shopping bags, urging all citizens to comply with the directives to stop using such bags. Non-compliance will result in strict actions, said Tapan Kumar Biswas, additional secretary and chair of the monitoring committee on this issue under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate, during a monitoring operation at New Market Kitchen Market in Dhaka on Friday. He told reporters that since November 3, authorities have conducted 166 raids to enforce the ban. Officials fined 349 establishments a total of Tk 19,29,900 and confiscated 40,000 kg of polythene during this period. ‘Public awareness is growing, and we are witnessing gradual improvements,’ he said. ‘Awareness campaigns, providing alternatives, and strict enforcement are advancing simultaneously,’ added Tapan. During the monitoring activity, market committee members acknowledged the harmful effects of polythene usage and pledged to adopt eco-friendly alternatives.

"Floods kill 8, thousands evacuate in Malaysia, Thailand","Flooding in northern Malaysia and southern Thailand has claimed lives of at least eight people and forced tens of thousands to flee homes, officials in both countries said on Friday. More than 80,000 people were evacuated to 467 temporary shelters in Malaysia this week, with four deaths recorded across the northern states of Kelantan, Terengganu and Sarawak, according to disaster officials. Floods in neighbouring Thailand killed two people in Pattani province and two in Songkhla province, the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation said on its Facebook page. More than 240,000 households in southern Thailand have been affected by the flooding, it said, following days of heavy rain. Images from Pattani showed knee-high waters lapping at shuttered shopfronts and a rescue team evacuating some residents by boat. ‘The flood level is high, so it’s impossible to move our belongings elsewhere,’ one resident in Pattani told Thai broadcaster PBS. ‘We have to sacrifice them.’ Malaysia’s National Disaster Command Centre said it had mobilised a team to aid rescue operations in affected states. The weather offices of both countries have forecast heavy rain until at least Saturday. Floods are an annual phenomenon in Malaysia and southern Thailand. Malaysia Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said Thursday that the floods were ‘expected to be more severe than in 2014’ -- when about 118,000 people fled their homes -- according to the official Bernama news agency. Thousands of emergency services personnel have been deployed in flood-prone states along with rescue boats, four-wheel-drive vehicles and helicopters, Zahid, who chairs the National Disaster Management Committee, was also quoted as saying.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/251518/floods-kill-8-thousands-evacuate-in-malaysia-thailand
CA’s press secretary urges journalists to fight Indian media’s misinformation campaign with truth,"Bangladesh interim government chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam has encouraged journalists and editors to talk to the Indian media to confront the misinformation campaign coming from some of the Indian media outlets and their social media platforms. ‘We must tell our stories our way. Else, they will set our narrative according to their liking,’ he said, highlighting the importance of getting empowered by the truth to fight against misinformation campaign. Alam, in Facebook post from his verified account, said Indians should know that smart people also live in its Eastern border and a few months back these people ousted a ‘brutal dictatorship’ in one of the finest revolutions in human history. The press secretary said he was happy to see some of the journalists were speaking to the Indian media, especially their TV stations. ‘Many of us were afraid that we would struggle against the verbal onslaught of their TV hosts,’ Alam observed. He said some had defied fears and they are ‘boldly telling our side of the story.’ Alam said they had realised that it was time to confront an ‘industrial scale misinformation campaign’ coming from some of the Indian media outlets and their social media platforms. The press secretary said he knew they would make mistakes and they would also be intimidated. ‘Some may get the impression that the Indians are smarter people. But believe me, if you are empowered by the truth, no misinformation campaign can stop you,’ Alam said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251517/cas-press-secretary-urges-journalists-to-fight-indian-medias-misinformation-campaign-with-truth
Electoral offenders should be punished: Badiul Alam,"Chief of the electoral reform commission Badiul Alam Majudar on Friday said that the perpetrators of crimes committed in the last three general elections should be punished. ‘Those who committed electoral crimes in the last three elections should be punished. The election commission committed the biggest crimes,’ he said. Badiul Alam was addressing a shadow-parliament [debate] on the ‘role of the EC, candidates and citizens for a fair election’, organised by Debate for Democracy at the Bangladesh Film Development Corporation in Dhaka. He said that the government was the most important partner in the elections after the EC. If the government didn’t help, it wouldn’t be possible even for a neutral election commission to conduct a fair election. About the newly constituted election commission, headed by AMM Nasir Uddin, the reform commission chief said that a tree was known by its fruits. ‘But, there is no big challenge for this EC. Because, unlike last time, there is no pressure from the ruling political party,’ he said. Badiul Alam said that many media didn’t provide true information about the last three national elections. ‘The role of the media in elections is important. But in the last three elections, some media deliberately did not tell the truth, while some others were even forced not to tell the truth,’ he said. The reform commission chief said that ensuring the participation of women voters and expatriate voters could be a challenge for the election commission. Citing that the election system reform is important, he added, ‘But time must be given for reform [in the electoral system].’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251516/electoral-offenders-should-be-punished-badiul-alam

UN slams ‘stubborn digital divides’ keeping 1 in 3 offline,"The United Nations said Wednesday that global internet use was slowly increasing, but warned that glaring disparities in poorer regions especially meant a third of the world’s population remained offline. An estimated 5.5 billion people are currently online, the UN’s telecoms agency found in a fresh study. That marks an increase of 227 million people compared with last year, according to revised estimates for 2023, the International Telecommunication Union said. That shows ‘that one-third of humanity still does not use the internet’, Cosmas Luckyson Zavazava, head of the ITU’s Telecommunication Development Bureau, told reporters in Geneva. He voiced concern about deep disparities between urban and remote rural areas, and cautioned that ‘universal connectivity remains a distant prospect’ in many poorer countries. In all, 68 per cent of the global population is now online, the ITU said, but lamented in a statement that ‘stubborn digital divides persist’. The report ‘is a tale of two digital realities between high-income and low-income countries’, ITU chief Doreen Bogdan-Martin said in the statement. ‘Stark gaps in critical connectivity indicators are cutting off the most vulnerable people from online access to information, education and employment opportunities.’ Indeed, the data presented in the ITU report shone a light on stark differences between regions and groups. While 93 per cent of people in high-income countries were estimated to be using the internet this year, only 27 per cent of people in low-income countries were online, the report showed. ‘The gap has almost been bridged in high income countries, while the divide remains deep in low-income countries,’ Zavazava said. ‘The world is inching towards universal access at a time that it should be sprinting.’ On the positive side, the ITU highlighted that the gender gap in internet access was shrinking, with an estimated 70 per cent of men online, compared to 65 per cent for women. ‘Although there are 189 million more men than women using the internet, the report found that the world has been moving towards gender parity, except in the least developed countries,’ Zavazava said. Less progress has been made on bridging the urban-rural divide, with 1.8 billion of the 2.6 billion people offline living in rural areas, the report showed. ‘Our call for action is that we must intensify our efforts to connect to the world and not to leave anyone behind,’ Zavazava said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/251513/un-slams-stubborn-digital-divides-keeping-1-in-3-offline
Pak journalist probing protest deaths arrested,"A Pakistani journalist investigating alleged fatalities during protests in support of jailed ex-prime minister Imran Khan has been arrested under anti-terror laws, his lawyer said on Thursday. This week more than 10,000 marchers flooded Islamabad, defying a ban on public gatherings before being evicted in a sweeping security crackdown. The government said at least five security personnel were killed whilst Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf  party allege at least 10 of their own were shot dead by security forces. Government ministers have denied the allegations. Matiullah Jan, a presenter for TV channel Neo News with a popular YouTube channel, and another reporter were investigating the claims at Islamabad’s PIMS Hospital when they were detained late Wednesday, his lawyer Imaan Mazari said. ‘They were trying to ascertain the total number of deaths,’ she said. ‘They were doing their journalistic duties.’ She said the second journalist was released but Jan has remained in custody. Islamabad police issued a report accusing him of drug possession and assaulting an officer whilst under the influence. A case ‘has been registered under the Anti-Terrorism Act for the attempted murder of a policeman on duty’, the report said. Mazari said Jan was brought before an anti-terror court in Islamabad for a hearing on Thursday afternoon where he was remanded in custody for two days. ‘The reason for this, you all know, is that I was working on the dead bodies,’ he told reporters as he entered court. Successive Pakistan governments have been criticised by rights monitors for using overbroad anti-terrorism legislation to quash dissent. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan demanded Jan’s ‘immediate and unconditional release’. ‘This authoritarian tactic to silence journalists must cease,’ the organisation said in a statement on social media site X. Jan has a history of criticising Pakistan’s powerful military establishment, which analysts say engineers the rise and fall of the country’s civilian leaders. He was also briefly detained by uniformed men in the middle of Khan’s four-year tenure in 2020. The Asia office of the Committee to Protect Journalists said ‘authorities must ensure Jan’s safety and immediate release’. More than 1,000 marchers were arrested over the three days of unrest in Islamabad, police said. Amnesty International said security forces used ‘unlawful and excessive force’ on crowds. But information minister Attaullah Tarar told reporters on Wednesday PTI ‘are lying saying people have died’. Protesters’ chief demand was the release of Khan, who has been jailed since August 2023 and snarled in a succession of legal cases he insists were orchestrated to prevent his comeback in February elections. PTI won more seats than any other party in the vote but were shut out of power by a coalition of parties considered close to the military establishment. The party has staged regular protests alleging the vote was rigged, but this week was the largest by far to grip the capital since the poll.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/251512/pak-journalist-probing-protest-deaths-arrested
"12 killed in Sri Lanka, storm heads to India","Sri Lankan rescuers on Thursday recovered the drowned corpses of six children, taking the number killed in torrential rains to 12, as a powerful but slow-moving storm headed towards India. More than 3,35,000 people in Sri Lanka have been forced to flee after their homes were flooded, Colombo’s Disaster Management Centre said. It said two men driving a tractor and trailer which had been transporting the six children in the eastern Amara district when it was swept away in floods, were still missing. Searches continue for them. Indian weather officials said there was a ‘possibility’ that the deep depression over the southwest Bay of Bengal could develop into a cyclonic storm. Cyclones — the equivalent of hurricanes in the North Atlantic or typhoons in the northwestern Pacific — are a regular and deadly menace in the region. Having skirted the coast of Sri Lanka, it was now moving north towards India’s southern Tamil Nadu state. The India Meteorological Department said it was expected to hit Tamil Nadu and Puducherry city’s coastline on Saturday morning as a ‘deep depression’ with winds ‘gusting up to 70 kph’. Sri Lanka’s DMC said some 3,35,155 people were seeking temporary shelter in public buildings after their homes were swamped. Nearly 100 homes had been completely destroyed while another 1,700 had been badly damaged due to rains as well as mudslides. The government said it deployed over 2,700 military personnel to help in relief operations. Deadly rain-related floods and landslides are common across South Asia, but experts say climate change is increasing their frequency and severity.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/251511/12-killed-in-sri-lanka-storm-heads-to-india

Russia launches massive aerial attack on Ukraine’s energy sector,"Russia’s army on Thursday launched a massive attack on Ukraine’s energy sector, forcing emergency power outages as temperatures dropped to freezing across the country. Ukraine’s energy grid has been heavily targeted since Russia invaded in February 2022, with Kyiv accusing Moscow of ‘terror’ tactics by trying to plunge Ukrainian cities into darkness and cut off heating to civilians throughout the winter. The overnight strikes come after two weeks of dramatic escalation that has seen both sides launch new weapons to gain an upper hand ahead of Donald  Trump being inaugurated as US president in January. Ukraine’s energy minister German Galushchenko said power infrastructure was ‘under massive enemy attack’ after a countrywide air alert was issued for incoming missiles. The air force reported a string of Russian cruise missiles and attack drones heading for cities across the country, including the capital Kyiv, Kharkiv in the northeast and the Black Sea port city of Odesa. ‘Once again, the energy sector is under massive enemy attack. Attacks on energy facilities are taking place across Ukraine,’ Galushchenko said. National power grid operator Ukrenergo had ‘urgently introduced emergency power cuts’, he added, as temperatures dropped to around 0 degrees Celsius. Energy provider DTEK said Ukrenergo was introducing emergency power outages in the regions of Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipro and Donetsk. The nationwide attack was ongoing as of 08:00am (0600 GMT), according to messages from the air force. ‘As soon as the security situation will allow it, the consequences of the strikes will be specified,’ Galushchenko said. President Volodymyr Zelensky’s chief of staff said the wave of attacks showed Russia was ‘continuing their tactics of terror.’ ‘They stockpiled missiles for attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, for warfare against civilians during winter,’ Andriy Yermak said in a post on Telegram and pledged that Ukraine would respond. A senior UN official, Rosemary DiCarlo, this month warned Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure may make this winter the ‘harshest since the start of the war’. Russia earlier this week said it was preparing its own retaliation for Ukrainian strikes on its territory using US-supplied ATACMS missiles. Ukraine has launched at least three attacks on Russian border regions with the missiles since the White House gave it permission to fire them on Russian territory. Moscow responded to the first strike by firing a never-before-seen hypersonic ballistic missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. In an angry address to the nation, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the nuclear-capable missile could be used against Western countries if they let their arms be used by Ukraine to hit Russia. Russia’s defence ministry said Thursday it had downed 25 Ukrainian drones fired overnight, including 14 over the southern Krasnodar territory — just to the east of the annexed Crimean peninsula. Krasnodar’s governor said a woman was wounded by falling debris in the town of Slavyansk-on-Kuban, around 100 kilometres east of the Kerch bridge — the giant infrastructure project linking Crimea to Russia that Kyiv has heavily targeted throughout the war. The latest missile salvo comes a day after US president-elect Trump named staunch loyalist and retired general Keith Kellogg as his Ukraine envoy, charged with ending the Russian invasion. Trump campaigned on a platform of securing a swift end to the Ukraine war, boasting that he would quickly mediate a ceasefire deal — comments that have triggered concern in Kyiv that the US could push it to cede land. Kellog, an 80-year-old national security veteran, co-authored a paper this year calling for Washington to leverage military aid as a means of pushing for peace talks. The outgoing Joe Biden administration has urged Ukraine drop the minimum age of conscription to 18 to plug severe manpower shortages across the 1,000-kilometre front line. Russian troops have been advancing in the east for months, where they have a manpower and ammunition advantage over Ukraine’s stretched forces.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/251506/russia-launches-massive-aerial-attack-on-ukraines-energy-sector
India urges Bangladesh to protect minorities,"India has called upon Bangladesh government to ensure the safety and security of Hindus, all minorities and their places of worship. In reply to a question in parliament on the attack on minorities in Bangladesh, Indian minister of state of external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh on Thursday said that several incidents of desecration and damages to Hindu temples and deities in Bangladesh were reported in the past few months. ‘The government of India has expressed its concerns about such incidents, including the attack on a Puja mandap in Tantibazar, Dhaka and the theft at the Jeshoreshwari Kali temple at Satkhira during Durga Puja 2024,’ he said. he primary responsibility for the protection of life and liberty of all citizens of Bangladesh, including minorities, rests with the government of Bangladesh,’ Kirti Vardhan added.

Ousted Bangladesh PM hiding in India says Chinmoy arrested unjustly,"Bangladesh’s deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Thursday said that Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari was ‘unjustly arrested’ and must be released immediately, Hindustan Times reported on Thursday. She also asked the Bangladesh government to protect religious and national minorities that braved violence since her ouster from power on August 5. ‘A top leader of the Sanatan Dharma community has been unjustly arrested, he must be released immediately. Temples have been burnt in Chittagong. In the past, mosques, shrines, churches,  monasteries and houses of the Ahmadiyya community had been attacked, vandalised, looted and set on fire. Religious freedom and security of life and property of people of all communities must be ensured,’ the Awami League posted Hasina’s statement on X as mentioned in the report available online. ‘After the killing of countless Awami League leaders, activists, students, the public and members of the law enforcement agencies, harassment through attacks, cases and arrests is going on. I strongly condemn and protest at these anarchist actions,’ she added. After Sheikh Hasina fled to India on August 5 amid a student-led mass uprising, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been heading the interim government in Bangladesh since August 8. Hasina also protested against killing of lawyer Saiful Islam Alif on the Chattogram court premises, according to the report. ‘A lawyer was killed in Chittagong. I strongly protest at this murder. Those involved in this murder must be found and punished quickly. Human rights have been grossly violated through this incident. A lawyer went to perform his professional duties, and those who beat him to death in this way are miscreants. Whoever they are, they must be punished,’ she said, the report added. ‘If the Yunus government, which seized power unconstitutionally, fails to punish these miscreants, it will also have to face punishment for violating human rights. I appeal to the countrymen to stand united against this kind of terrorism and militancy. It is important to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the common people,’ she added, the report mentions. The lawyer was killed and 25 others were injured during a clash between followers of spokesperson of Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote and former ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das and law enforcement agencies on the Chattogram court premises on November 26 over sending Chinmoy to jail in a sedition case.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/251504/ousted-bangladesh-pm-hiding-in-india-says-chinmoy-arrested-unjustly
"Bangladesh Bank prints notes, injects Tk 22,500cr to 6 troubled banks","Bangladesh Bank governor Ahsan H Mansur on Thursday said that the central bank has provided Tk 22,500 crore in liquidity support to six struggling banks to ensure customers can withdraw funds from Sunday onward. He assured that the central bank would supply as much money as necessary to meet depositors’ demands, emphasising that their money is secure. However, he urged customers to withdraw only the amount they urgently need. Mansur made the statement at a press conference held at the central bank head office on the day, admitting that these funds were provided by printing money. Of the total amount, First Security Islami Bank received Tk 5,500 crore, Social Islami Bank Tk 4,000 crore, Global Islami Bank Tk 2,000 crore, Union Bank Tk 2,000 crore, EXIM Bank Tk 5,000 crore, and National Bank Tk 4,000 crore. Mansur reassured depositors, stating that no customer would leave a bank empty-handed from Sunday onward. He noted that the central bank had shifted from its earlier stance against printing money, to prioritise protecting depositors. To mitigate the inflationary impacts, the central bank introduced instruments to mop up excess liquidity from banks with surplus funds through issuing government bonds, ensuring that the net reserve money does not increase and the contractionary monetary policy remains intact. Mansur highlighted the dual focus — controlling inflation, while safeguarding depositors’ interests. When asked about the differences from the previous government’s practice of printing money for bank support, he said that the key difference is that theft has been stopped. He explained that every bank is now closely monitored, and accountability has been established, unlike the previous period when printed money often facilitated money laundering. He added that the boards of the struggling banks have also been restructured. The governor clarified that liquidity support would be limited to a few struggling banks, while most banks are being encouraged to prioritise internal money management and interbank borrowing over reliance on central bank funds. When questioned about S Alam Group’s recent legal threats, Mansur said, ‘What they do is their business. We will recover depositors’ money by selling their assets according to the law. Discussions with the attorney general have been held to finalise the legal process.’ Regarding pressures from influential groups, Mansur stated firmly, ‘I will not tolerate mob justice. If pressured, I’d rather resign than allowing irregularities.’ On rise of defaulted loans, he said that previous figures did not reflect the true extent of defaults. ‘Now, accurate accounting will provide a clear picture. If defaulted loans exceed 25 per cent, let it be,’ he remarked. National Bank chairman Abdul Awal Mintoo, who also attended the press conference, said that the banking sector and the overall economy are grappling with severe downturns and liquidity crises, with National Bank being no exception. He disclosed that a significant amount was taken out from National Bank through irregularities, causing substantial damage and leading to widespread public panic and diminishing trust in the banking sector. Mintoo noted that National Bank, with the central bank’s support, is working to recover from its losses. He added that the disruptions caused by irregularities had severely impacted the bank’s foreign trade revenue, but expressed optimism about a potential recovery. He also said that with the liquidity support from the central bank, the National Bank would be able to meet depositors demand and recover from the crisis within three months. In a separate press conference held at the National Bank head office earlier on the day, the bank’s sponsor-director Moazzem Hossain revealed that the people responsible for the looting had been identified. He claimed that some errant borrowers owned properties worth Tk 1,000 crores in Gulshan. Efforts are underway to recover these funds, with plans to sell off assets if the looted amounts are not returned.

Politicians for strong govt role to ensure media freedom,"Condemning the recent attacks on media outlets and intimidation of journalists in various ways, politicians on Thursday demanded a strong role from the interim government to ensure freedom of the media. The demand came at an exchange-of-views meeting with politicians organised by the Newspaper Owners’ Association of Bangladesh at a hotel in Dhaka city. ‘Our fight is for establishing freedom of speech. We will make every effort to protect freedom of press, freedom of people, and freedom of vote at any cost,’ Bangladesh Nationalist Party secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said while addressing the programme. He said that today even after 53 years of independence, and mass uprising of the students, people have to talk about attacks on the media. ‘Unfortunately, today some people are trying to mislead the nation. We all need to unite and stop this. Otherwise, the goal for which our youths gave their lives, our people gave their lives, will all fail,’ he said. He also said that since the 1971 War of Independence people had been fighting for democracy. ‘We raised a movement to create a democratic state system. But sometimes there are actions that lead to depoliticisation. We all need to consciously avoid it,’ he said. An elected government is better than any government whatever it might be, he stressed. ‘Let democracy be practised, which has not happened in the past 53 years. Through practice we can move forward,’ he added. He also mentioned that creating anarchy or heading towards disorder would bring nothing but disaster for the nation at this moment. Nagarik Oikya president Mahmudur Rahman said that the country would face serious difficulties if freedom of the media could not be ensured, urging the government for its steps in this regard. Communist Party of Bangladesh general secretary Ruhin Hossain Prince said that attacks on some media outlets were not isolated incidents, adding that it was actually an attack on the media on the whole. ‘The government should act effectively’ to stop attacks on the media, he said. Jaamat-e-Ismai assistant secretary general AHM Hamidur Rahman Azad said that democracy would not flourish without a free media. He said that media also should act responsibly to build the nation in a democratic manner. Several Islamic party leaders urged the newspapers for coverage without discrimination. Daily Star editor Mahfuz Anam said that the media endured massive oppression in the past 15 years. ‘We want an end to any type of oppression on the free press, but we are experiencing attacks in a new manner,’ he said, adding that politicians’ role was essential to protect the freedom of the press. NOAB president AK Azad said that the organisation noted with deep concern that in the aftermath of the student-people mass uprising, when the media was supposed to work in a pressure-free environment, attempts and threats continued to put pressure on some media outlets. Threats of closure were also being made. ‘The kind of programme that a group has recently held and continues to campaign against The Daily Star and Prothom Alo is nothing but an intense threat to the freedom of the press,’ he said. ‘At the same time, we have seen that the editor of New Age has been harassed twice at the airport, just like in the old authoritarian era. The accreditation cards of journalists, including an editor, have been cancelled indiscriminately,’ he said. The incidents of besieging two newspaper offices, creating chaos, and attacking their local offices and obstructing newspaper distribution in different parts of the country were in no way acceptable, he said. He said that the atmosphere of fear that was being created at the moment was an extreme threat to the freedom of the press. ‘We expect the help and cooperation of all political parties in ensuring the freedom of the press. In this critical moment of the country, we hope that the political parties will take the necessary initiatives in this regard,’ AK Azad said. Having reminded all that the freedom of the media was one of the greatest vehicles for an effective democracy, he urged the students, intellectuals and civil society to voice their concern and protest at the attempts at curbing press freedom. ‘It can be said that the future of our aspired democratic Bangladesh depends on the freedom of the press,’ he said. Among others, Socialist Party of Bangladesh general secretary Bazlur Rashid Feroz, Revolutionary Workers Party general secretary Saiful Huq, AB Party member secretary Majubur Rahman Manju, Ganosamhati Andolan chief coordinator Zonayed Saki, and National Citizens’ Committee convener Nasiruddin Patwary also spoke at the programme. From the media side, Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman, New Age publisher ASM Shahidullah Khan, its editor Nurul Kabir, and daily Jugantor editor Saiful Islam, were present, among others, at the programme moderated by daily Bonik Barta editor Dewan Hanif Mahmud.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251502/politicians-for-strong-govt-role-to-ensure-media-freedom

No discussion to ban ISKCON: Rizwana,"Environment, forests, climate change adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan on Thursday said that no discussion was held to ban International Society for Krishna Consciousness in Bangladesh. ‘No discussion was held in the government to ban ISKCON [in Bangladesh]. Many may raise demands. People may take programmes to press home their demands. We are not mixing the offenses of organisations with the offenses of individuals,’ she told a press briefing at foreign service academy in Dhaka.

"Titas loses Tk 3,000cr amid rising system losses across Bangladesh","Bangladesh’s largest gas distributor lost gas worth about Tk 3,000 crore during the past financial year as its system loss climbed further up compared with the year before. The system loss, as reported by the state-owned company, Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited, reached 7.66 per cent in 2023–24, up from 5.28 per cent reported in 2022–23. The overall loss of the company, responsible for supplying gas to about 30 lakh customers, mainly in five zones in Dhaka and Mymensingh, increased by 350 per cent. Titas gas distributes 55 per cent of all gas produced annually. The officially-announced system loss has always been viewed with suspicion. In 2022, a government analysis revealed the year’s system loss to be 13 per cent against the officially-announced 2 per cent. ‘The system loss more or less has been the same always,’ said Arpana Islam, general manager, finance division of Titas gas. She did not admit that the system loss was never as high as 13 per cent but confirmed that it was never 2 per cent either. Officially, 2 per cent system loss was announced in 2021 and 2020 as well. Titas officials also said that the system loss was never actually calculated. The loss was kept at 2 per cent following a decision of the energy ministry, they said. Energy experts long accused Titas of corruption, gas theft and inefficiency and cited the mismatch in the account of system loss as evidence. Authorities, however, came up with explanations, such as, its decades-old rusty and porous pipe line causing a substantial loss of gas every year. In the past financial year of 2023–24, the Titas’s finance division said that the company received 15,698 million cubic metres of gas and sold 14,495mmcm. The sale of the gas earned the company Tk 35,692 crore. The gas supply under the non-metered category, providing piped gas to households, increased by 5mmcm, though there was no reason for the supply to increase. A moratorium on giving new connections to households has been in place for about a decade due to rapid depletion of the gas reserve. The 5mmcm of gas is equal to over 41 lakh tonnes of oil. Household remains the country’s single-largest gas consumer category. The increase in household gas supply indicates unabated theft of gas which often occurs with the help of the department’s officials through illegal gas connections. Energy experts argue that establishing illegal connections by reaching gas pipelines buried deep under the earth is not possible without help from government officers. Entire villages and neighbourhoods in cities can be found that run on illegal gas connections with pipes dangling dangerously overhead or running along the ground, exposed to direct human and transport contacts. Titas has failed to come up with an exact account of illegal connections though the problem persists over decades. In 2022–23, Titas disconnected 2.82 lakh illegal connections through which all types of consumers—industries, households, commercial clients and captive consumers—were involved in gas theft. Allegations are there that disconnected connects are usually are re-established bringing opportunity to the corrupt officials to make yet another round of illegal income. The gas supply to industries dropped by almost 6 per cent in the last financial year with the supply in the sector falling to 3,842mmcm from 4,075 mmcm. The drop in the industrial gas supply is shocking and runs counter to the narrative developed by the immediate past Awami League government about a robust economic growth. ‘Energy crisis led to the drop in the industrial gas supply,’ said Kazi Mohammad Saidul Hasan, general manager, operation division of the Titas gas. ‘The pressure of gas was particularly very low. Industries require high pressure for production,’ he explained. Industrialists said that their reliance on liquefied petroleum gas greatly increased in the past year because the government had failed to ensure energy even after increasing its price. In January last year, gas prices were increased by up to 179 per cent for industries, power and commercial sectors. Some consumers, however, received more gas in the past financial year compared with the year before. For example, fertiliser industry received 135 per cent more gas, CNG filling stations received over 9 per cent more gas, while the power sector received 5 per cent more gas. Titas, supplying gas with 13,391kilometres of pipeline, reported a loss of Tk 744 crore in the past financial year. The loss rose by more than 350 per cent compared with the previous year for what the company said a rise in tax. Titas now needs to pay a minimum tax. In the past financial year, Titas paid Tk 872 crore in tax against its distribution margin of Tk 303 crore. Titas is a non-profit company that is allowed to charge only Tk 0.23 for distributing a cubic feet of gas. In March 2022, Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission revealed in a public hearing that Titas was charging its customers far more than it should regarding its actual supply. Then Titas managing director Md Haronur Rashid Mullah admitted at the public hearing that 10 per cent of his employees might be dishonest. Titas has nearly 2,000 staff.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/power-energy/251496/titas-loses-tk-3000cr-amid-rising-system-losses-across-bangladesh

Belongings of three families looted in Mohammadpur,"Robbers allegedly looted belongings of three families living at tin-shed houses in the Chand Udyan area in the capital’s Mohammadpur in the early hours of Thursday.

Countless stories of oppression over last 15 yrs: Nahid Islam,"Information and broadcasting adviser to the interim government, Nahid Islam, on Thursday said that numerous stories of oppression, including the horrifying experiences of Aynaghar remained untold because of the victims’ sheer terror. Nahid Islam said this at a discussion titled ‘The Politics of Satire and Ridicule: Cartoons and Graffiti During the July Uprising’. The discussion was organised by the Department of Sociology at Professor Muzaffar Ahmed Chowdhury Auditorium at the Faculty of Social Sciences at Dhaka University. He also said that despite repeated requests from the government for these individuals to share their experiences, they refused to disclose their trauma. Addressing the audience, Nahid Islam highlighted that over the past 15 to 16 years, countless instances of oppression and people’s stories have found expression through art. During that time, mainstream newspapers had even ceased publishing cartoons, reflecting the suppression of creative freedom. Highlighting the taboo surrounding Aynaghar and disappearances, he said, ‘Around 1,600 petitions were submitted to the Commission on Enforced Disappearances, and the number may rise to 5,000.” Professor ASM Amanullah, vice-chancellor of National University, spoke at the event, which was chaired by sociology department chair professor Fatema Rezina Iqbal. At the discussion, Samina Luthfa, an associate professor at Dhaka University, presented the keynote paper. She analysed the theoretical framework of wall writings, language, and social media’s role in amplifying movements. Referring to the 2018 quota reform movement, she explained how the mainstream media suppressed the word ‘razakar’ (traitor) to undermine the movement, a tactic that failed during the 2024 mass uprising. Gitiara Nasreen, a faculty member of the Department of Mass Communication and Journalism at Dhaka University, and Md Jahangir Alam, vice-chancellor of Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University and faculty members from the Department of Sociology also shared their thoughts at the discussion.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251493/countless-stories-of-oppression-over-last-15-yrs-nahid-islam
HC begins hearing death reference,"The High Court on Thursday commenced the hearing of the death reference in the murder case of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology’s student Abrar Fahad. The reference involves death sentences of 20 expelled leaders and activists of the Bangladesh Chhatra League. All were also BUET students. The hearing also includes appeals filed by five former students sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder, and separate appeals of 17 detained death row convicts out of the 20 sentenced to death in the case. On Thursday, the bench of Justice AKM Asaduzzaman and Justice Syed Enayet Hossain began hearing the death reference and appeals and adjourned the hearing until December 4. Deputy attorney general Jashim Uddin started reading the voluminous paper book. The court rejected a defence prayer for a four-week adjournment filed by lawyer Md Masud Hasan Chowdhury Porag, who argued that he had received the paper book only the previous day. Attorney general Md Asaduzzaman, representing the state, opposed the adjournment, urging an expedited hearing due to the public significance of the case. Abrar Fahad was brutally beaten to death on October 7, 2019, inside his residence hall by leaders of the university’s BCL chapter. The killing was reportedly triggered by Abrar’s Facebook posts criticising government agreements with India. The incident sparked nationwide and international protests, marking a turning point in the political landscape of the country. On August 6, Muntassir Al Jemi, one of the 17 death row convicts held in Kashimpur High Security Central Jail, escaped following a mass jailbreak involving 202 prisoners. On August 5, 2024, Sheikh Hasina was deposed as the prime minister, fled to India by helicopter through a 36-day student-led uprising. A senior jail official confirmed that only 40 escapees were recaptured or voluntarily returned to custody. The interim government, prioritising the Abrar Fahad case, ordered swift proceedings after the paper book for the case, spanning 11,000 pages, was prepared under the directive of chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed. Dhaka’s Speedy Trial Tribunal 1 sentenced 20 of the 25 accused to death on December 8, 2021, and handed life imprisonment to the remaining five. The High Court received the death reference in January 2022. The students sentenced to death by the tribunal are Mehedi Hasan Russel, Muntassir Al  Jemi, Khandaker Tabakkarul Islam Tanvir, ASM Nazmus Sadat, Md Mizanur Rahman Mizan, Shamsul Arefin Rafat, Md Shamim Billah, Hossain Mohammad Toha, Md Moniruzzaman Monir, Md Mehedi Hasan Robin (aka Shanta), Muzahidur Rahman Muzahid, Anik Sarker Apu, Md Meftahul Islam Jeon, Ifti Mosharraf Sakal, SM Mahmud Setu, Morshed Amatya Islam, Md Mazedur Rahman Mazed, Morshed-Uz-zaman Mondal Jisan (absconding), Ehteshamul Rabbi Tanim (absconding), and Mostaba Rafid (absconding). The five accused who have got life imprisonment are Muhtasim Fuad, Md Akash Hossain, Moaj Abu Hurayra,  Amit Saha,  and Istiak Ahammed Munna. Abrar’s father, Barkat Ullah, filed a case against 19 students, with police later submitting a charge sheet against 25. The police investigation found Abrar was outspoken that made many angry with him, and he had no political affiliations. On November 13, 2019, the Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge’s Court took cognisance of the charge sheet filed by Detective Branch against the 25. The case was later transferred to the Speedy Trial Tribunal following a plea of the complainant. On September 15, 2020, the tribunal charged the 25 accused with murder and abatement to the murder. Of the 25 accused, 11 accused took part in the murder directly and the others assisted the killing, the prosecutors had argued and sought the highest punishment for them.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251492/hc-begins-hearing-death-reference

Reform for equitable primary health care,"A health commission incorporating public health managers and local government institutions could manage tax funds to procure and regulate healthcare quality and coverage, writesAbu Muhammad Zakir Hussain REFORMS are expected to address problems in quality and quantity coverage or target attainment or both. Problems may be due to poor planning, budgeting, management and leadership skills, including weak supervision for quality and poor monitoring for quantity. Good management should consider human resource development and management; the management of medicine, logistics, technology and information; physical structures; and services. One fundamental aim is to ‘leave no one behind’, addressing equity, the fulfilment of health needs of all, which needs appropriate and adequate financing.  Financing for universal coverage PUBLIC tax-based Beveridge model, which allows people to buy private insurance, funds health care in many western countries. Besides public hospitals, governments recruit private hospitals as well, when necessary. Primary health care is given through individual general practitioners or groups of such people, contracted by local public bodies. Social health insurance is an approach where premiums are paid by the management and the staff. For the jobless, premiums are covered by public taxes. National health insurance is universal health coverage, funded by pooled insurance premiums but managed by contracted organisations. Out-of-pocket payment is the most regressive and inefficient method of healthcare procurement as it is not based on informed decision and has no negotiating power. The purchase of care by a single purchaser chosen from multiple providers offers price negotiating powers to the purchaser, besides imposing favourable purchasing conditions that benefit service receivers. A single management entity accrues a smaller administrative cost. The Bangladesh government also organises healthcare services through public taxes. But the tax base is inadequate for universal health coverage, especially in urban areas. To address this problem partly, local government institutions must allocate at least 15 per cent of their budget for health care. Additional taxes, eg, sin tax must be channelled to health care. Two per cent tax should be levied on health services on certain foods, drinks and private vehicles, which have adverse health implications. Fund might also come from co-payment from patients through registration fees for all, at all levels, as per the economic status of service seekers, which would also prevent the moral hazard. A portion of the corporate social responsibility from entrepreneurs should also be realised for health services. The finance ministry should fund local government institutions directly to enable them to undertake their health responsibilities. A health commission with national, divisional, district and upazila offices, incorporating public health sector managers and local government institutions may be entrusted to manage the tax fund to procure and regulate healthcare quality and coverage by the public sector and the private sector. The combined entity should also participate in planning, budgeting, monitoring, review and public hearing at all levels. Healthcare financing should be needs-based and the internal rate of return should dictate the priority of budgeting. Budget heads should be (1) human resources, its management and development, (2) planning and budgeting, (3) financing and accounting, (4) public communication, (5) knowledge and information management, (6) service and programme management, including clinical care, (7) incentive, (8) medicine, (9) vehicles, machines, supplies and equipment, (10) technology and innovation, ((11) sustainable and user-friendly physical structure, (12) renovation, maintenance and repairs, (13) stakeholder engagement and (14) operational costs, including transport costs for supervisory travel.  Addressing in-service inefficiency ON THE fringe. three categories of service providers have been entrusted with providing primary healthcare services. But their services are not complementary. The community health care providers are wrongly supposed to provide alone all sorts of stationery services at community clinics which overburdens them. The field staff may be given the same responsibilities while dividing their target population equally. This will enable the catering of more necessary services at the entry, the community clinics. A task group should develop an efficient terms-of-reference for them. Operational budget for these fringe staff is nominal and fixed for all weathers, distances and conditions which compels the poorly paid staff to spend additional money on travel especially in hard-to-reach areas. Community health care providers pay electric bills for community clinics from their salary. Although 65 local influential form community groups and community support groups to support community health care providers and bear the coast of repairs and maintenance of community clinics, they are hard to find around. They are also alleged to demand medicine from community clinics, which comes free. It is warranted that the community support groups should be abolished. It is also warranted that the operational costs for community clinics should be sent to the upazila health and family planning officers on a yearly basis.  Planning flaws at unions and solutions THE union health sub-centres, 1,260 in number, are the most inefficiently managed health care units in the sector. All of them should have adequate office space for an assistant health inspector and other required officials, who will provide outpatient-based preventive, promotive and limited curative care, primary diagnostic services and normal delivery services. They will be given through medical officers — two although WHO recommendations 15 — a medical assistant, a midwife, a medical technologist, a pharmacist, a guard and a support staff. All of them, except the last two, should have separate office/clinic and residential arrangements as per entitlement. The last two officials will be selected from among local people. Assistant health inspectors and medical officers should also function as supervisors for community clinics. Besides, medical officers should also provide consultation services for waiting patients enlisted with the community clinics. Adequate travel and food allowances should be allocated for them to cover travel to distant clinics. A 20 per cent top-up needs to be added to the salaries of medical officers and 10 per cent for other non-local staff to attract them to stay in unions. No private practice or collaboration with the private sector by them should be allowed. If the conditions are not abided by public-sector service providers, local general practitioners or these people and providers of other categories as a team with due skill mix may be contracted in or out. Contracting the general practitioners will have to be needs-based, efficient, based on the number of people to be served and the illnesses to be treated by complexity. The qualifications and readiness of general practitioners and their chambers should be assessed for contracting. What additional support, including training and logistics, will be required by the general practitioners to be contracted will have to be assessed before contracting. Information is also required if chambers of general practitioners will need to be renovated or supported with logistics. A law will be required for these sorts of contracting. The process of buying services from the private sector, including general practitioner services, should be left with the divisional level, which will be participated in by the upazila and district level management and public bodies concerned. A public-private partnership scheme may be thought of, conversely, where general practitioners or groups of general practitioners will finance the construction or renovation of union health sub-centre complexes on government land (concession), operate and transfer the sub-centres after the contract period is over, to the government. The government may then again invite all local general practitioners to submit bids which will then require a lower bid amount. At this point, we advise the government to reign in the infrastructural duplication between family planning and health departments. Both the departments have medical officers and medical assistants providing maternal and child health services in unions. To prevent duplication, family planning personnel should cater the same services from those 3,300 unions where there are no health department facilities.  Equitability of clinical, public health services UPAZILA public health units will be responsible for planning, budgeting and implementation of locally planned activities and nationally bestowed programmes, undertake personnel management and the management of logistics, physical facilities, information, training, monitoring, review and supervision and submit performance and expenditure reports for all the three primary healthcare tiers. Public engagement will be ensured at each level in planning, budgeting, review, public hearing and community awareness. The upazila clinical and diagnostic care may be tagged to district hospitals, where upazila health and family planning officers will have no role. Upazila health and family planning officers will act as field, community clinic and union-level top planners, implementers, reviewers, supervisers and monitors. It would include disease prevention and control activities through disease surveillance and vaccination. They would also assess and address patient complaints, pharmacovigilance, polypharmacy, induced care, patient and provider safety, and adverse effects of vaccines, service coverage, health communication, staff attendance in all kinds of health facilities, all health-related procurement, all health management information and the regulation of both the public and the private sector health facilities in upazilas and unions. They should be supported by a medical officer for disease control and prevention, a nutritionist, a health-related communications officer, a management information officer, a logistics officer and an accountant. A mirror image functioning is also warranted at district and divisional levels for primary healthcare services. Local level planning, both activities and budget, may be developed within a given ceiling at unions, upazilas, districts and divisions. The family planning department has maternal and child welfare centres in districts and upazilas and in a few unions. These are duplications. Maternal and child welfare centres are not at the centre of patients’ interest as district hospitals and upazila health complexes with expert service providers are available nearby. Maternal and child welfare centres should come under a unified system of care under the health department.  Resource management Human resources: Allocation for adequate and appropriate human resources with right kind of service provider mix for a given epidemiological profile at a given location should be a priority. The World Health Organisation suggests 4.45 service providers as a minimum per 1,000 population to attain Sustainable Development Goal 3. The organisation also suggests a skill-mix ratio of 1:3:5 physician: nurses: paramedics. The WHO proposition would lead to a staggering estimate. We suggest that our efforts are driven towards recruitment along this line, starting with 10 per cent of the estimates now. We recommended the provision of technical personnel for urban areas from the ministry of health and family welfare and administrative and support staff from the local government, rural development and cooperatives ministry. This should be the practice for urban primary health care. Additional fund for urban primary health care should come to local government institutions from the finance ministry directly. Planning, budgeting and implementation review of urban primary health care should be the combined responsibility of local government institutions, health and family welfare ministry and the local government, rural development and cooperatives ministry. Line/programme directors and their assistants will have to be deployed based on their proved experience, educational qualification and leadership quality and should be selected through interviews by a board to be constituted of five superior officers and guest selectors who have required qualifications in the relevant field and are well known for their honesty. Logistics: Human resources and logistics should be complementary to each other and based on local needs. Appropriate skills must be ensured to handle the allocated logistics before procurement. Assessment of local needs should be a requisite for any deployment and procurement. An equitable availability of resources could address all the health needs of the population on every location. Logistic support for urban areas should come from the health and family welfare ministry through its divisional, district and upazila primary healthcare offices. Additional health facility: If need be, private hospitals, clinics and diagnostic centres might also be contracted when warranted. The situations for such contracting will be clear in writing, eg, in emergency or overloaded situation. The contracting conditions, i., payment conditions should be clear. The conditions should be reflected in their licensing conditions.  Improving quality and coverage Medicine: Medicine is the most important commodity that service seekers appreciate. The existent list should be reviewed and updated every five years. There should never be any incidence of stockout of enlisted medicines. It is necessary that use of the medicine given at community, union and upazila levels is monitored and the quality of prescription is supervised by clinical experts. Fund for medicine in urban areas should come from local government institutions and the finance ministry should top this to ensure the remaining fund from government revenue. Technology: A table of necessary equipment, furniture, vehicle, supplies and the other relevant tools should be available at three tiers of primary health care and at the district and the divisional offices relevant for urban primary health care. This list should be reviewed and updated every five years. The latest available technology, eg, software-based automated data recording and transmission, telemedicine, e-medicine etc should be ensured inasmuch as possible that would ensure efficiency. Physical facilities: Physical facilities should be distributed equitably with efficient designs. Adequate and appropriate offices, residence and clinic spaces should be available to relevant officials as per eligibility of the positions that either exist now or will be created in future. Four-room community clinic archetype facilities should be developed throughout the country. But the number of such facilities should be based on population dispersal and density. While in urban areas, one such facility may suffice for 50,000 people, in hard-to-reach areas, one may be necessary for 2,000 to 3,000 people. Health facilities owned by other sectors, usually in urban areas, should be checked for their use and, if necessary, a corner of such facilities may be used as a community clinic or equivalent to a union health facility. A continuous availability of electricity and safe water should also be ensured by the government at all tiers. It is also necessary to ensure that the health facilities and their basic amenities should ensure sustainability and disaster adaptability. Every health facility/office should be comfortable for officials and for waiting service seekers, or patient attendants, suitable for different ages and sex. At least two cleaners should be recruited at union health facility, and one at each community clinic, selected through contracting, to be held at divisional level in the presence of the relevant civil surgeon, urban health and family planning officers and one local public representative. In urban areas, additional physical facilities should be built by the local government institutions. Any shortfall in this regard should be met up by the finance ministry. Community engagement: Since the engagement of the community has been suggested, adequate fund — budget for snacks and tea for meetings, for example — should be needed to bring them into the system. Every health facility should have a public management body composed of upazila and union chair as per relevance and local healthcare providers. These should replace the older ones. Orientation, training and continuous education: The personnel promoted to a position should always be given training to suit the newly assumed position. The orientation and training should be preceded with a need assessment exercise and the training or orientation curriculum be organized according to its findings. As part of capacity build-up, seminars should be organised at union and upazila levels to be participated by the community and union level workers every month. Community workers would bring complex cases to the discussion table, for solution or referral by attending medical officers. Patient-centred services: Every healthcare worker at upazilas, union and community levels should know of the various quality indicators and parameters. Induction and refresher trainings should be organised for them, that should emphasis on service quality and competency. Supervision: Supervision has to be done through some structured protocol and job-related tools. Clinical audits would be warranted for medical prescription. Monitoring and supervision: Monitoring might be conducted online. It has to be continuous or episodic, according to the applicable tier. A standing monitoring framework should be developed and used. Dedicated monitors may be recruited from among retired officials, the private sector or private individuals with required experiences. Selection would be through an interview board composed of officers. Their contracting should be based on an agreed terms-of-reference. Various groups of monitors should be deployed for different purposes, ie, for the monitoring of the fulfilment of contracting conditions in various fronts, eg, covenant on free services to 10 per cent of the poor service recipients in private hospitals; the submission of service-related information by private service providers and hospitals and other functions mentioned. The monitoring teams or groups would be supervised and monitored by the urban health and family planning officers, civil surgeons and divisional directors. Adequate allowances but only for supervisory and monitoring and, in rare cases, travels should be ensured for supervisers of upazila and union levels. Other management functions: Management decision should be evidence-based. This is a culture that needs to be developed fast. Managers should learn how to manage programmes, personnel, finance, logistics, information technology and software and contracts. Healthcare management should be gender- and poverty-sensitive and emphasise improving community awareness on family planning, adolescent care, disease prevention and nutrition improvement and other services mentioned. A government order should be in order in this regard. Management and review meetings should be supported with adequate logistics and fund. Regulation of clinical and diagnostic services: Health and performance related information should cover both the public and the private sector. Urban health and family planning officers, civil surgeons and divisional directors should be entrusted to monitor, not supervise, licensing conditions only for the private sector and other performances and services, mentioned. Leaving these responsibilities to the hospital management will ensue a conflict of interests. Innovation, change and learning: No de novo action or recommendation that brings in any change in the system should be adopted ever, without unbiased piloting and job analysis. The condition of efficiency and reduction in price and cost in services delivery should be ensured. The catchment area of each facility of all tiers should be mapped which would also help to line up the referral system. Every family and its members should be registered with the help of a unique number. Community-based birth, death and marriage registration by age and sex should be a priority to assess the impact of the healthcare interventions and goal attainment. Referral and transport: Strong emergency and critical care services should be ensured at referred sites. High-level health facilities should also be able to provide care for complicated non-communicable diseases as per competence. Health services should be available round the clock in referred facilities. A penalty fee should be applied to those who seek care at higher levels without referral. Ambulances may be of different types based on the topography of a location, eg, boats, three-wheelers, pedalled four-wheelers, etc and should be free for every registered family. Except motor ambulances, other types may be given to local entrepreneurs to run and maintain, conditional to their use as an ambulance, when necessary, on a priority basis. Public bodies, linked to the health facilities, may be entrusted to monitor their use. Incentive: The health sector should develop a culture of incentivising good performance annually. The incentive may be monetary or non-monetary. Monetary incentives may be given as a top-up of the salary. It may also be recognition given at public meetings at district and national levels. Contrarily, non-performance should make a staff liable to punitive action, eg, the degrading of salary by one or two steps. Transfers should never be considered a punishment.

Empowering against gender violence,"THE ‘16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence’ is a global campaign observed annually from November 25 (the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women) to December 10 (Human Rights Day). Its core purpose is to galvanise efforts to eliminate violence against women and girls. This year’s theme, ‘United for Justice: Ending Violence Against Women and Girls,’ emphasises collective action to dismantle systemic inequalities and end gender-based violence. In Bangladesh, this campaign holds profound significance, resonating with the nation’s ongoing struggles and aspirations for gender equality and social justice. It also embraces deep relevance, reflecting both the strides made and the challenges that remain in addressing violence against women and girls. Despite progress in areas like education and women’s economic participation, gender-based violence persists as a significant barrier to achieving gender equality and social justice. The theme reinforces the importance of unified efforts across sectors — government, civil society, and grassroots movements — to create a society where every woman and girl can live free from violence and discrimination.  Context of violence against women BANGLADESH has made notable strides in gender equality, achieving gender parity in primary and secondary education and increasing women’s participation in the workforce. However, violence against women remains a pervasive issue. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics Violence Against Women Survey 2021 reveals that 50 per cent of women in the country have experienced some form of violence in their lifetime. The pandemic Covid exacerbated this issue, with reports of domestic violence surging during lockdowns. Cultural norms, economic dependency, and inadequate enforcement of laws perpetuate gender-based violence. Initiatives like the 16 Days of Activism offer a platform to address these systemic challenges by fostering dialogue, raising awareness, and mobilising stakeholders across sectors.  Significance of campaign FOR Bangladesh, the 16 Days of Activism is not merely an international observance but a call to action. Each year, government bodies, civil society organisations, educational institutions, and grassroots activists organise events, workshops, and campaigns to challenge gender-based violence and promote gender equality. The campaign provides an opportunity to reflect on progress, identify gaps, and strengthen collective efforts. Raising awareness at the grassroots: Community-based organisations play a pivotal role in translating the campaign’s global message into local action. In rural areas, where gender-based violence is often normalised, initiatives during the 16 Days of Activism include street plays, community dialogues, and awareness drives. These efforts help break the silence surrounding abuse, empowering survivors to speak out and seek help. Engaging young people: Young people are crucial allies in the fight against gender-based violence. Schools and universities often organise debates, art competitions, and theatre performances during the campaign to educate students about consent, healthy relationships, and gender equity. This engagement not only sensitises the younger generation but also nurtures a culture of respect and equality. Advocacy and policy influence: The 16 Days of Activism serves as a platform for advocacy, urging policymakers to prioritise gender-based violence in national agendas. Activists and organisations use this period to push for the implementation of existing laws, such as theDomestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act, 2010, and advocate for new measures to protect survivors and hold perpetrators accountable.  Challenges in gender-based violence WHILE the 16 Days of Activism brings attention to gender-based violence, challenges remain in translating awareness into action. Key obstacles include: Cultural and social barriers: Deeply ingrained patriarchal norms often justify violence as a disciplinary measure, discouraging women from reporting abuse. Changing these attitudes requires long-term investment in education and community engagement. Weak legal and institutional frameworks: Despite progressive laws, enforcement remains inconsistent. Survivors face hurdles in accessing justice due to stigma, corruption, and lengthy legal processes. Resource constraints: Shelters, counselling services, and legal aid for survivors are limited, particularly in rural areas. Increased investment in these resources is critical to ensure holistic support for victims. Intersectionality of violence: Marginalised groups, such as ethnic minorities, transgender individuals, and persons with disabilities, often face compounded forms of violence. Addressing gender-based violence requires an intersectional approach that considers these diverse experiences.  Opportunities for change THE 16 Days of Activism in Bangladesh also highlights opportunities to accelerate progress: Leveraging technology: Mobile apps, helplines, and online campaigns have emerged as powerful tools to support survivors and raise awareness. Initiatives like the Joyeeta Foundation’s helpline for women entrepreneurs demonstrate how technology can bridge gaps in support services. Strengthening Public-Private Partnerships: Collaboration between government, NGOs, and the private sector can amplify the impact of gender-based violence interventions. For instance, corporate sponsorships for awareness campaigns can expand their reach and sustainability. Fostering male allyship: Engaging men and boys in gender-based violence prevention is essential to dismantling patriarchal norms. Programmes like theHeforShecampaign have successfully mobilised male allies to advocate for gender equality. Integrating gender-based violence prevention in education: Incorporating topics such as consent, gender stereotypes, and healthy relationships into the national curriculum can instill values of respect and equality from an early age.  Looking ahead: beyond 16 days WHILE the 16 Days of Activism is a powerful catalyst for change, addressing gender-based violence requires sustained efforts throughout the year. This includes: Strengthening survivor support systems: Establishing more shelters, counselling centres, and legal aid services. Ensuring accountability: Holding perpetrators accountable through swift and fair legal processes. Promoting economic empowerment: Reducing women’s dependency on abusive partners by expanding access to education, skills training, and employment opportunities. Measuring impact: Regularly monitoring and evaluating gender-based violence interventions to identify gaps and refine strategies.  Conclusion THE 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence is a vital opportunity for Bangladesh to reaffirm its commitment to gender equality and social justice. By harnessing the energy and momentum of this campaign, the nation can pave the way for a future where every individual, regardless of gender, lives free from violence and fear. However, this vision will only become a reality through collective action, sustained advocacy, and unwavering determination to address the root causes of gender-based violence. Let the 16 Days of Activism be a reminder that the fight for gender equality is not a sprint but a marathon — a journey that demands resilience, courage, and unity.

A welcome step that needs proper implementation,"THE Bangladesh Bank tightening loan classification rules by shortening the period of overdue loans to become non-performing to six months from nine months is welcome. The rules aligned with international practices, issued in a circular on November 27, would give a clearer picture of non-performing and bad loans in the banking sector. The rules are likely to help the authorities regulate the banking sector more efficiently and to address distressed assets, including non-performing loans, more effectively. They will, as the circular says, come into effect on April 1, 2025. According to the new rules, loans overdue for three to six months will be classified as substandard, the first step of non-performing loans, while loans will be classified as doubtful if they remain overdue for six months to a year. The period now is nine months to a year. Loans overdue for more than a year will be classified as bad loans. This classification had, in fact, previously been in use but was altered by the previous government to obscure the extent of defaulted loans. The reduction in the period might, as economists say, see an increase in non-performing loans and pose challenges to some businesses but will help to discipline the banking sector in the long run. Bangladesh Bank data show that the amount of defaulted loans increased to Tk 2,84,977 crore in September, about 17 per cent of the total bank loans of Tk 16.82 lakh crore. This is the highest ratio of defaulted loans in South Asia. The previous government, which offered irrational concessions one after another to defaulters, showed a lower figure of defaulted loans. Once the new rules come into effect, the figure is likely to increase, but it will also put regulatory authorities in a better position to address the issue that has crippled the banking sector. The new rules are also likely to help banks address provision shortfall, which increased to Tk 55,378 crore in September from Tk 31,549 crore in June. Keeping to the new rules, banks must maintain provisions against their general category loans at a rate of 1 per cent and 5 per cent of the loan balance for special mention accounts, a category newly introduced. Loans that remain overdue for two to three months will be categorised in special mention accounts. Banks are also required to maintain 20 per cent provision for loans in the substandard category, 50 per cent for loans in the doubtful category and 100 per cent for loans in the bad or loss category. All this appears to be a positive step towards disciplining the banking sector, on the edge of collapse for a decade and a half because of political influence, manipulation and lack of democratic governance. The government and the central bank should, therefore, enforce and implement the steps to ensure transparency, accountability and sound management practices in the banking sector.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/251457/a-welcome-step-that-needs-proper-implementation
Selection that search committee makes should be transparent,"A MAJOR reason that holds back the Anti-Corruption Commission from functioning independently, as stakeholders think, is the appointment of the top three officials — the chair and two commissioners — often picked up from among retired bureaucrats, close to the ruling quarters, who mostly protect partisan interests. Bureaucrats in service are also appointed on deputation to the positions of the commission’s secretary and the directors general. The commission, which is an institution of accountability, is thus mostly used as a weapon of the government to save the people close to the ruling quarters and punish the people who are in the opposition. In a set of recommendations on how to afford more power to the commission — which is the statutory, independent corruption prevention and corruption investigation agency of the state — experts and stakeholders have said that a search committee is instituted on the formation of the commission and the committee recommends six likely names for the president to pick three individuals for the top three positions. But in reality, retired civil servants are appointed to the positions in most cases. And, the government, thus, places people of its choice in the commission to maintain a comfortable control of the commission. This seriously erodes the commission’s ability to act with independence. Experts view that the absence of any policy on the selection of the three from among the six that the committee names remains a major problem as this allows the government to appoint people of its choice to the three positions. This allows the government the space to run the commission keeping to the will and interests of the government. The process of selection should, of course, be done keeping to a pronounced policy to check against any partisan bias in the appointment of the three ranking people to the commission. But what yet remains an issue of further trouble is that people at large almost never get to know who the people that the search committee names for the selection are. This is the right of the citizens to know whom the search committee names and to see whom the government appoints. This also allows people to assess what goes around the appointment of the three. And, this could ensure transparency of a sort and place the search committee and its selection under the public lens. The issue was also manifest in the selection of names by the search committee on the formation of the Election Commission. The government on October 31 instituted a search committee which named 10 people for the chief and four other election commissioners. The commission was formed on November 21. Whilst the search committees that the government institutes on the institutions of accountability such as the Election Commission or the Anti-Corruption Commission should be allowed to work independently, free of any influence of the government, the names that the search committees names should also be made public to place both the committee and the government under the public lens to ensure transparency in the process.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/251454/selection-that-search-committee-makes-should-be-transparent
