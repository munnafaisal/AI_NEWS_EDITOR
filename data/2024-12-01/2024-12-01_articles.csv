Afghanistan must participate in future climate talks: Taliban,"An Afghan environment official on Sunday said the country must be allowed to participate in future global climate talks, after returning from COP29 in Baku where Taliban officials attended for the first time. The Afghan delegation were invited as ‘guests’ of the Azerbaijani hosts, not as a party directly involved in the negotiations. It was the first time that an Afghan delegation had attended since the Taliban swept to power in August 2021, having failed to get an invite to the past two Conference of the Parties held in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. ‘Afghanistan must participate in such conferences in the future,’ said Matiul Haq Khalis, the director general of Afghanistan’s National Environmental Protection Agency, at a press conference on Sunday. He described Afghanistan’s attendance last month at the talks as a ‘big achievement’. ‘We participated in the conference this year so that we could raise the voice of the nation about the issues we are facing, what the needs of the people are, we must share these things with the world.’ He said the Afghan delegation had meetings with ‘19 different organisations and governments’, including with delegations from Russia, Qatar, Azerbaijan and Bangladesh. Afghanistan is among the countries most vulnerable to global warming, despite minimal emissions, and the Taliban government have argued that their political isolation should not bar them from international climate talks. The government has imposed an austere version of sharia Islamic law since taking power, severely restricting women’s participation in public life in what the United Nations has called a ‘gender apartheid’. Among the poorest countries in the world after decades of war, Afghanistan is particularly exposed to the effects of climate change, which scientists say is spurring extreme weather including prolonged drought, frequent floods, and declining agricultural productivity. The United Nations has also called for action to help Afghanistan build resilience and for the country’s participation in international talks. Developed countries have committed to providing $100 billion per year in climate finance through 2025 to help developing nations prepare for worsening climate impacts and wean their economies off fossil fuels.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/251760/afghanistan-must-participate-in-future-climate-talks-taliban

"JU students protest at admission quota, demand reforms","A group of Jahangirnagar University students staged a demonstration on JU campus, calling for reforms to what they described as a discriminatory quota system in university admissions, on Sunday. Under the banner of ‘Save the Mass Uprising Movement’, the protesters formed a human chain in front of the university’s administrative building at noon. They also submitted a three-point demand to the administration, urging immediate changes to the existing quota distribution system. Their demands are abolition of the vice-chancellor quota, removal of the freedom fighters’ grandchildren quota and rational reform of the employee dependents quota. Protesters criticised the VC quota for allowing admissions based on recommendations, calling it an undue privilege that undermines merit-based selection. They argued that freedom fighters’ quota was outdated and perpetuated inequality in the admission process. They also called for a review and restructuring of employee quota to ensure fairness and logical application. Abdur Rasid Jitu, coordinator of the platform, stated that they demanded a merit-based admission system that was inclusive and eliminated outdated practices favouring select groups. Leaders of the platform emphasised the importance of meritocracy in education and called for an inclusive and fair system that provided equal opportunities for all students, irrespective of their backgrounds. The protest has sparked widespread discussion about the fairness of university admission policies across the country, including at Rajshahi University and Islamic University in Kushtia. The JU administration has yet to issue a response to the demands.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251757/ju-students-protest-at-admission-quota-demand-reforms
Public engagement stressed to prevent dengue,"Entomologists and public health experts on Sunday said that there was no alternative to public engagement in preventing dengue which had been taking heavy toll on people. The National Institute of Preventive and Social Medicine organised a public awareness programme at its office in the capital’s Mohakhali and held a campaign procession marching from the office to nearby areas to create awareness and engage people, said a press release. NIPSM director professor Md Ziaul Islam inaugurated the programme as its chair in the morning. He said that without the cooperation of all stakeholders dengue prevention was not possible. Later, four groups of people visited households and public establishments in the area to raise awareness about the aedes breeding spots and the ways to eradicate the mosquito. Leaflets were also distributed among people in Mohakhali. NIPSOM’s entomology department head professor Md Golam Sharower said that public awareness and involvement must in destroying the breeding grounds of Aedes mosquito.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251756/public-engagement-stressed-to-prevent-dengue
Metro on the brink of win against Chattogram,"Dhaka Metro were on the brink of victory in their final-round match of the National Cricket League against Chattogram after reducing them to 173-6, leading by 65 runs on Day 2 at the Shaheed Kamruzzaman Stadium in Rajshahi on Sunday. Metro imposed a 108-run lead by scoring 268 in response to Chattogram’s 160 in the first innings, courtesy of Aich Mollah’s 57 and three forty-plus knocks from Naim Sheikh (42), Anisul Islam (45), and Shamsur Rahman Shuvo (42). In the second Innings, Chattogram’s batting faltered yet again against the bowling of Abu Haider Rony (4-41) and Arif Ahmed (2-55), who grabbed two. Nayeem Hasan and Ahmed Sharif were batting on 34 and eight runs, respectively, before the bails were drawn due to bad light. With Sylhet already emerging as champions, if Metro can secure eight points from this match, they will have an unlikely chance of securing the second spot with a tally of 29 points. Unless Dhaka Division, currently in second place with 25 points, can force a result against Barishal. Rony Talukdar struck a ton as Dhaka posted 303-8, taking a narrow lead of 14 runs against Barishal at stumps at the Shaheed Chandu Stadium in Bogra. Right-handed Rony faced 202 deliveries to score 112 runs, which included 16 boundaries and a six. He was the last wicket to fall on the day, caught by Sohag Gazi off a delivery by Moinul Islam. Mojammel Hasan Shakil (2-62) scalped the most for Barishal, who are struggling at the bottom of the points table. Earlier, half-centuries from Sohag Gazi (78) and Fazle Mahmud Rabbi (64) saw Barishal post 289 runs. Meanwhile, the match of current third and fourth position holders Rangpur and Khulna were hit by rain at the Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium in Khulna and was rolling towards an expected draw. Rain spoilt the opening day, allowing only 25 overs, while the second day saw a total of 44 overs as Khulna reached 240-7. Opener Anamul Haque Bijoy made 90 off 142 balls, supported by skipper Mohammad Mithun’s 89 in 146 balls, laced with 10 boundaries and two sixes. Mukidul Islam Mugdho, Ariful Haque, and Nobin Islam each took two wickets apiece for Rangpur. In another match, Rajshahi reached 70-3, leading by 84 runs against champions Sylhet at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium. Meherob Hasan top-scored with 32 runs, and Habibur Rahman made 28. Earlier, Rajshahi dismissed Sylhet for 212 runs, taking a lead of 14 runs; left-arm spinner Nihad Uz Zaman claimed 4-61.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251755/metro-on-the-brink-of-win-against-chattogram-
Victory procession held on DU campus,"The administration of Dhaka University on Sunday staged a victory procession marking the month of victory on the campus of the university.

Bangladesh a win away from Junior Hockey World Cup,"Bangladesh Under-21 hockey team’s dream of a semi-final berth in the Men’s Junior Asia Cup 2024 was dashed when they were held to a 1-1 draw by China in their final Pool B match at the Al Amerat Hockey Stadium in Muscat, Oman, on Sunday. Though Bangladesh’s hoped for a final-four spot were dashed, their dream of qualifying for the FIH Hockey Men’s Junior World Cup for the first time remained alive, as the top six teams from this competition will advance to the Junior World Cup. On Tuesday, Bangladesh will play Thailand, who finished fourth in Pool A, in one of the two fifth-to-eighth place deciders, while China will face South Korea, who finished fourth in Pool A. A win over Thailand will put Bangladesh in the Junior Hockey World Cup 2025 to be held in India. Against China, Bangladesh got the lead in the 41st minute when Mohammad Ali scored a field goal while Yubo Wang restored the parity scoring from the penalty corner in the 45th minute. Bangladesh finished with five points from four games, including a 2-2 draw against Malaysia after a 6-0 loss to Pakistan and a 3-1 victory against Oman in their first encounter.

Shakib still in Champions Trophy plans: BCB boss,"Bangladesh Cricket Board president Faruque Ahmed stated that all-rounder Shakib al Hasan was still part of their plans for the forthcoming ICC Champions Trophy 2025. Speaking to the media during the ‘Youth Festival 2025’ event on Sunday, Faruque acknowledged the challenges for Shakib to represent the national team while being abroad but remained hopeful for his return. ‘Shakib is still on the list, and we hope that the way he wants it, if there is a solution, then definitely he still possesses the capability to play for the national team. But in this way, it’s not easy to play from outside the country,’ Faruque told the media. Shakib was advised not to return to the country after the cricketer wanted to play his farewell Test at home against South Africa; he also missed the Afghanistan series in the UAE in November. The all-rounder’s participation in the West Indies ODIs also appears unlikely, as the president emphasised that representing the national team while staying outside the team’s environment is difficult. ‘Playing for a franchise and playing for the country are not the same. You need preparation and being able to gel with the team,’ Faruque said. ‘Since he can’t do those things, he is not in a big mental state to play for the country. Because of that, we have left this thing up to him on what he wants to think.’ The BCB president added that Shakib’s participation in the upcoming BPL depends on the law enforcement agencies and the justice system. ‘Actually, I can’t say much about it. If you keep asking me about it, it’s embarrassing. I want him to play. But the whole thing—the reasons why he can’t come—it’s not related to the board. The law enforcement agencies, courts, they have to mention it,’ he added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251751/shakib-still-in-champions-trophy-plans-bcb-boss

Quamrul Hassan’s birth anniv today,"Today is the 103rd anniversary of birth of eminent artist Quamrul Hassan, who was called ‘Patua’ for his fascination with age-old traditions that he represented on canvases. Born on December 2, 1921 in Kolkata in British India, Quamrul Hassan, especially known for designing the national flag of the country, developed a unique style using elements from folk art. He came to Dhaka after the partition of India in 1947, and helped establish the Dacca Art College, which is now the fine arts faculty of Dhaka University. A versatile artist, he practically worked with all mediums, including oil, gouache, watercolour, pastel, etching, woodcut, linocut, pen and pencil. Art historians and critics evaluate the artist as master artist for his unique ability to blend traditional folk art with Western cubism – an early-20th-century avant-garde art movement pioneered by Georges Braque, Pablo Picasso and others. He was involved with all major national movements, including the War of Independence in 1971 and the non-cooperation movement in 1969. His caricature portraying the ferocious gesture of Pakistani military dictator Mohammad Yahya Khan is still considered a seminal work on the brutalities of the War of Independence. He received several prestigious awards and honours, including President’s Gold Medal, Independence Award, Bangladesh Charu Shilpi Sangsad Honour and others. Quamrul Hassan passed away right after completing the sketch of a snake satirising the military dictator and Jatiya Party chairman Hussain Muhammad Ershad titled Desh Aaj Bishwa Behayar Khappare at the second National Poetry Festival on Dhaka University campus on February 2, 1988.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/others1/251749/quamrul-hassans-birth-anniv-today
Centre-right parties set to hold power in Ireland,"The incumbent centre-right parties Fianna Fail and Fine Gael looked set to retain power in Ireland as vote counting in the European Union member’s general election resumed on Sunday. With around 45 seats of the new 174-seat lower chamber of parliament decided, the parties were ahead of the main opposition party, the left-wing nationalist Sinn Fein. Local media projected Fianna Fail, led by the experienced Micheal Martin, 64, would win the largest vote share and over 40 seats. Fine Gael, whose leader Simon Harris, 38, is the outgoing prime minister, were in second place according to projections, with Sinn Fein in third. To form a majority, a party or coalition requires at least 88 seats. Both centre-right parties have repeatedly ruled out entering a coalition with Sinn Fein. The centre-left opposition Labour party is seen by Fine Gael and Fianna Fail as the most likely junior coalition party, according to local media. The Green Party was the third member of the previous coalition but its support collapsed nationwide, with all but one seat likely to be lost. At the last general election in 2020, the pro-Irish unity Sinn Fein — the former political wing of the paramilitary Irish Republican Army — was the most popular party but could not find willing coalition partners. That led to weeks of horse-trading, ending up with Fine Gael, which has been in power since 2011, agreeing a deal with Fianna Fail. During the last parliamentary term, the role of prime minister rotated between the Fianna Fail and Fine Gael leaders. The final seat numbers, which will not be confirmed until early next week, will determine whether Harris returns as taoiseach or Martin takes the role under a rotation arrangement. The new parliament is due to sit for the first time on December 18, but following coalition talks a new government is not expected to be formed until the new year. The three-week campaign, launched after Harris called a snap election on November 8, was dominated by rancour over housing supply and cost-of-living crises, health, public spending, and the economy .",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/251748/centre-right-parties-set-to-hold-power-in-ireland
"Unsustainable farming, forest loss driving Earth to precipice: UN","Unsustainable farming and deforestation are threatening the planet’s capacity to sustain human societies, the UN warned Sunday, on the eve of international talks on land degradation and desertification. Forest loss and degraded soils are reducing resilience to climate change and biodiversity loss, creating negative feedback loops and driving the world to a dangerous ‘precipice’, scientists said in a report jointly released with the UN Convention to Combat Desertification. It comes as nearly 200 nations are expected to gather in Saudi Arabia for the UN desertification summit on Monday tasked with expanding restoration efforts to restore 1.5 billion hectares of degraded land this decade. The meeting is expected to be the largest conference on land to date and comes in the wake of a clutch of tough-fought UN negotiations on climate, biodiversity and plastics. ‘If we fail to acknowledge the pivotal role of land and take appropriate action, the consequences will ripple through every aspect of life and extend well into the future, intensifying difficulties for future generations,’ said UNCCD executive secretary Ibrahim Thiaw. The new report highlights the heavy burden agriculture places on the planet and calls for a course correction. Farming is linked to 23 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, 80 per cent of deforestation and 70 per cent of freshwater use. ‘The expansion of agricultural land may feed more people in the short term, but it can accelerate soil degradation, biodiversity loss, and thus food insecurity in the long term,’ said Thiaw and Johan Rockstrom at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in the foreword. Beyond driving forest loss, industrialised agriculture uses huge quantities of chemicals in fertilisers and pesticides that create dead zones in waterways, harm biodiversity and increase emissions of planet-heating gases. Poor water management also depletes freshwater resources. Drawing on 350 sources of research, the report uses the concept of planetary boundaries, the ‘safe operating space’ for keeping the world liveable for most species. ‘The aim of the planetary boundaries framework is to provide a measure for achieving human wellbeing within Earth’s ecological limits,’ said Rockstrom. ‘We stand at a precipice and must decide whether to step back and take transformative action, or continue on a path of irreversible environmental change,’ he adds. Six of nine of these boundaries — climate change, deforestation, biodiversity loss, synthetic chemicals including plastics, freshwater depletion and nitrogen use — are already deep in the red. Two of the remaining three — ocean acidification along with the concentration of particle pollution and dust in the atmosphere — are borderline, with only ozone depletion comfortably within safe bounds. The report warned of accelerating feedback loops. Deforestation for example causes carbon emissions that worsen climate change, but forest loss also reduces the ability of the ecosystem to recycle water and cope with drought causing more trees to die. Solutions include tackling corruption, improving water management and agriculture reform. The report also recommended realigning hundreds of billions of dollars in harmful or inefficient agricultural subsidies with more sustainable farming practices. According to data shared with UNCCD by governments, land degradation affects an area of 1.5 billion hectares — nearly the size of Russia. And the area is increasing by an estimated 100 million hectares every year. In an interview with AFP, Thiaw said ‘global security is really at stake’, with forest loss and impoverished soils driving hunger, conflict and migration. Saudi Arabia’s high oil production routinely draws the ire of climate activists and accusations of efforts to undermine progress at other UN environment meetings. But its exposure to desertification gives Riyadh a greater stake in a positive outcome at the 12-day talks. The country, home to one of the world’s largest deserts, aims to restore 40 million hectares of degraded land, deputy environment minister Osama Faqeeha said, without specifying a timeline.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/251747/unsustainable-farming-forest-loss-driving-earth-to-precipice-un
"We have to fight together to prevent war, Taiwan’s Lai says in US","Taiwanese president Lai Ching-te said in the United States on Saturday that we have to ‘fight together to prevent war’, as he kicked off a week-long tour of the Pacific that has sparked fiery rhetoric from Beijing. Taiwan faces the constant threat of a military attack by China, which it considers part of its territory and regularly deploys fighter jets and warships around the self-ruled island to press its claims. Washington is Taipei’s most important partner and biggest provider of weapons, but maintains a ‘strategic ambiguity’ when it comes to putting boots on the ground to defend the island from China. Speaking at a dinner in the US island state of Hawaii on Saturday, Lai said there were ‘no winners’ from conflict and ‘we have to fight, fight together to prevent war.’ Lai earlier received a standing ovation as he walked down a red carpet for the gathering with US government officials, state politicians, members of Congress, and Taiwanese expatriates. He said the US flag and Hawaii state flag given to him as a gift ‘symbolise the longstanding friendship between Taiwan and the United States and lays the foundation for further cooperation in the future.’ The chairperson of the American Institute in Taiwan, the body that serves as the de facto US embassy, said the partnership between Washington and Taipei was ‘rock solid’. ‘The opportunity for you to engage with thought leaders, the diaspora’s community and state and local leaders is invaluable, and I know will contribute to further strengthening the rock solid US-Taiwan partnership,’ Laura Rosenberger said in a pre-recorded video played at the dinner. Like most countries, Washington does not recognise Taiwan diplomatically but maintains close unofficial ties. Beijing opposes any international recognition of Taiwan and its claim to be a sovereign state and especially bristles at official contact between the island and the United States. In a statement, China’s foreign ministry said it ‘strongly condemns’ the United States for Lai’s stopover and that it had ‘lodged serious protests with the US’. ‘China will closely follow the developments and take resolute and strong measures to defend our nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,’ it said. Lai, who is travelling abroad for the first time since taking office in May, was welcomed with red carpets, flower garlands and ‘alohas’ as he began the two-day stopover in Hawaii. Looking relaxed in a Hawaiian shirt, Lai flitted around, visiting a Pacific island history museum, an emergency management centre and the USS Arizona Memorial in Pearl Harbour. On his arrival, he was given the ‘red carpet treatment’ on the tarmac of Honolulu’s international airport, according to his office, which said it was the first time a Taiwanese president had been given such a welcome. He was met by Ingrid Larson, managing director in Washington of the AIT, Hawaii Governor Josh Green, and others. Taiwanese government officials have previously stopped over on US soil during visits to the Pacific or Latin America, angering China, which has sometimes responded with military drills around the island. After Hawaii, Lai will visit Taiwan’s allies the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau — the only Pacific island nations among the 12 countries that recognize Taiwan’s claim to statehood — and stop over for one night in the US territory of Guam. Lai said shortly before take-off in Taipei that the trip ‘ushered in a new era of values-based democracy’ and thanked the US government for ‘helping to make this trip a smooth one’. He said he wanted to ‘continue to expand cooperation and deepen partnerships with our allies based on the values of democracy, peace and prosperity.’ ‘I once again emphasise that we are all Team Taiwan. We all work together, and we can successfully achieve our goals,’ Lai told reporters on board the plane. An AFP journalist is travelling with the president for the duration of the trip. In a swift response to news of Lai’s trip on Thursday, Wu Qian, a spokesperson for China’s defence ministry said: ‘We firmly oppose official interaction with China’s Taiwan region in any form’ and vowed to ‘resolutely crush’ any attempts for Taiwan independence. Lai’s trip follows the US approval on Friday of a proposed sale to Taiwan of spare parts for F-16s and radar systems, as well as communications equipment, in deals valued at $385 million in total. The Taiwan president’s trip comes as Republican US president-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office in January. During his campaign, Trump caused jitters by suggesting Taiwan should pay the United States for its defence.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/251746/we-have-to-fight-together-to-prevent-war-taiwans-lai-says-in-us
New EU chiefs visit Kyiv on first day of mandate,"The EU’s new top diplomat Kaja Kallas and head of the European Council Antonio Costa arrived in Kyiv Sunday in a symbolic show of support for Ukraine on their first day in office. ‘We came to give a clear message that we stand with Ukraine, and we continue to give our full support,’ Costa told media outlets including AFP accompanying them on the trip. The European Union’s new leadership team is keen to demonstrate it remains firm on backing Kyiv at a perilous moment for Ukraine nearly three years into its fight against Russia’s all-out invasion. Questions are swirling around the future of US support once Donald Trump assumes office in January and there are fears he could force Kyiv to make painful concessions in pursuit of a quick peace deal. Meanwhile, tensions have escalated as Russian president Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike government buildings in Kyiv with his new Oreshnik missile after firing it at Ukraine for the first time last month. The Kremlin leader said the move is a response to Kyiv getting the green light to strike inside Russia with American and British missiles, and he has threatened to hit back against the countries supplying the weaponry. As winter begins Russia has also unleashed devastating barrages against Ukraine’s power grid and on the frontline Kyiv’s fatigued forces are losing ground to Moscow’s grinding offensive. ‘The situation in Ukraine is very, very grave,’ Kallas, a former prime minister of Estonia, said. ‘But it’s clear that it comes at a very high cost for Russia as well.’ The new EU leaders — the bloc’s top officials along with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen — were set to hold talks with Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky. Zelensky on Friday appeared to begin staking out his position ahead of any potential peace talks. He called on NATO to offer guaranteed protections to parts of Ukraine controlled by Kyiv in order to ‘stop the hot stage of the war’, and implied he would then be willing to wait to regain other territory seized by Russia. ‘If we speak ceasefire, we need guarantees that Putin will not come back,’ Zelensky told Britain’s Sky News. Kallas said that ‘the strongest security guarantee is NATO membership.’ ‘We need to definitely discuss this — if Ukraine decides to draw the line somewhere then how can we secure peace so that Putin doesn’t go any further,’ she said. Diplomats at NATO say there appears little prospect of the alliance granting Ukraine membership soon given opposition from a raft of members cautious of getting dragged into war with Russia. Kallas said the EU ‘shouldn’t really rule out anything’ in terms of the question of sending European troops to help enforce any ceasefire. ‘We should have this strategic ambiguity around this,’ she said. Trump has cast doubt on continuing Washington’s vast aid for Ukraine and called on EU countries to do more. Europe together has spent around $125 billion on supporting Ukraine since Russia’s 2022 invasion, while the United States alone has coughed up over $90 billion, according to a tracker from the Kiel Institute. Kallas said the EU would use a ‘transactional language’ to try to convince Trump that backing Kyiv was in the interest of the US. ‘Aid for Ukraine is not charity,’ she said. ‘A victory for Russia definitely emboldens China, Iran, North Korea.’ The new EU foreign policy chief said the bloc would continue seeking to put Ukraine in the ‘strongest’ position — if and when Kyiv chose it was time to negotiate with Moscow. But she conceded that it was becoming ‘increasingly difficult’ for the 27-nation bloc to agree on new ways to ramp up support for Ukraine. ‘This war has been going on for quite some time and it is harder and harder to explain it to our own people,’ she said. ‘But I don’t see any option.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/251745/new-eu-chiefs-visit-kyiv-on-first-day-of-mandate
Syria’s second city slips from government control,"Syria’s second-largest city Aleppo has fallen from government control for the first time since the country’s conflict began more than a decade ago, a war monitor said on Sunday, after a surprise advance by rebels. An Islamist-dominated rebel alliance has pressed a lightning offensive against forces of the Iranian- and Russian-backed Syrian government since Wednesday, the same day a fragile ceasefire took effect in neighbouring Lebanon between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah group after two months of all-out war. The Syrian army — supported by Russian air power — had recaptured in 2016 rebel-held areas of Aleppo, a city dominated by its landmark citadel. Damascus also relied on Hezbollah fighters to regain swathes of Syria lost to rebels early in the war which began in 2011 when the government crushed protests. But Hezbollah has taken heavy losses in its fight with Israel. The jihadist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and allied rebel factions ‘control Aleppo city, except the neighbourhoods controlled by the Kurdish forces,’ Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said. For the first time since the conflict started, ‘Aleppo city is out of control of Syrian regime forces,’ Abdel Rahman said. Several northern districts inside Aleppo are predominantly inhabited by Syrian Kurds under authority of the People’s Protection Units, the main component of the Syrian Democratic forces. The SDF are the de facto army in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of northeast Syria. They are a US-backed force that spearheaded fighting against the Islamic State group jihadists before IS’s territorial defeat in Syria in 2019. Separately, the jihadist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and allied rebel factions seized Aleppo’s airport and dozens of nearby towns on Saturday after overrunning most of Aleppo, the Observatory said. Damascus ally Moscow responded with its first air strikes on Aleppo since 2016. Prior to this offensive, HTS, led by Al-Qaeda’s former Syria branch, already controlled swathes of the Idlib region, the last area outside president Bashar al-Assad’s government control, in Syria’s northwest. HTS also held parts of neighbouring Aleppo, Hama and Latakia provinces. Allied Turkish-backed rebel factions have also been taking part in the offensive. The fighting has killed more than 370 people, most of them combatants but also including at least 48 civilians, according to the Observatory, which has a network of sources inside Syria. The Observatory said rebel advances came with little resistance. AFP images showed fighters posing with seized tanks. The Observatory on Sunday said the army strengthened its positions around Syria’s fourth largest city Hama, about 230 kilometres south of Aleppo, and sent reinforcements to the north of the surrounding province. Syria’s defence ministry said army units in Hama province ‘reinforced their defensive lines with diverse means of fire, equipment and personnel’, fighting to prevent a rebel advance. Rebels took dozens of towns across the north, including Khan Sheikhun and Maaret al-Numan, roughly halfway between Aleppo and Hama, the Observatory said. Some welcomed the rebels’ arrival. ‘Yesterday was my wedding but I didn’t distribute sweets,’ Khaled al-Yussef said, holding up pastries beside a car. ‘I’m distributing them today in celebration of the liberation of Maaret al-Numan.’ But in Idlib on Sunday, bodies lay in a hospital and vehicles were torched in the street, AFP images showed, after what the Observatory called Russian air strikes. Air strikes also occurred Saturday in Aleppo, where an AFP photographer saw charred cars, including a minibus. Inside one car, the body of a woman lay slumped in the back seat with a handbag beside her. Russian air strikes on parts of Syria’s second city are the first since 2016. Aaron Stein, president of the US-based Foreign Policy Research Institute,’ said ‘Russia’s presence has thinned out considerably and quick reaction air strikes have limited utility’. He said the rebel advance is ‘a reminder of how weak the regime is’. Another analyst, Dareen Khalifa of the International Crisis Group think tank, said the rebel alliance see their action in a ‘broader regional and geostrategic shift’, including when ‘the Iranians are weakened’. Syria’s ‘reliance on Russia and Iran’, along with its refusal to move forward with a 2015 peace process outlined by the UN Security Council, ‘created the conditions now unfolding’, said US National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett. The United States maintains hundreds of troops in Syria’s northeast as part of an anti-jihadist coalition. Iran’s top diplomat, foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, left Tehran for Damascus to deliver what state media said would be a message of support for Syria’s government and armed forces. Araghchi again called the surprise rebel offensive a plot by the United States and Israel and vowed that ‘the Syrian army will once again win’. Assad vowed to defeat the ‘terrorists’, however big their attacks. ‘Terrorism only understands the language of force, and that is the language which we will break it and eliminate it with, whoever its supporters and sponsors are,’ he said. Russia, whose air support was previously decisive in helping Syria’s government win back lost territory, joined Iran in expressing ‘extreme concern’ over their ally’s losses. ‘Strong support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic was reaffirmed,’ the Russian foreign ministry said in a summary of a call between its top diplomat, Sergei Lavrov, and Araghchi. Since 2020, the Idlib rebel enclave has been subject to a Turkish- and Russian-brokered truce that had largely been holding despite repeated violations. Lavrov also spoke with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan on Saturday and agreed on the need to ‘coordinate joint action to stabilise the situation’, Moscow said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/251744/syrias-second-city-slips-from-government-control
Exports to major markets rise in July-Oct,"Bangladesh’s export earnings from major markets, including the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom, grew in July–October of the 2024–25 financial year, driven by increased orders for readymade garments as global buyers shifted their focus from China. Exporters expressed optimism about receiving more orders in the coming months, but voiced concerns about sustaining the growth due to political tensions and an acute energy shortage. According to Export Promotion Bureau data, export earnings from the US, the single largest export destination for Bangladesh, grew by 16.32 per cent to $2.81 billion in the first four months of FY25 compared with those of $2.41 billion in the same period of FY24. The country’s readymade garment exports to the US in July-October period of FY25 increased by 16.57 per cent, reaching $2.46 billion compared with those of $2.11 billion in the same period of FY24. Export earnings from Germany in the first four months of FY25 increased by 9.08 per cent to $1.65 billion compared with those of $1.52 billion in the same period of FY24. In the period, readymade garment exports to Germany, the second largest export destination for Bangladesh, increased by 9.52 per cent to $1.54 billion compared with those of $1.41 billion in the same period of the previous financial year. Export earnings in July-October of FY25 from the UK, the third largest export destination for Bangladesh, grew by 7.02 per cent to $1.58 billion compared with those of $1.48 billion in the same period of FY24. Apparel exports to the UK in the period increased by 8.10 per cent to $1.49 billion compared with those of $1.38 billion. ‘With a strong flow of orders, we are highly optimistic about the future of the RMG business. However, deteriorating law and order situation and labour unrests remain major concerns for sustaining this growth,’ former Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association vice-president Abdullah Hil Rakib told New Age on Sunday. He said that Bangladeshi manufacturers were receiving increased orders as the global buyers were shifting their procurement from China. ‘I am very hopeful about the business prospects for 2025. If political stability is restored, the RMG sector could achieve 25 per cent growth in the year,’ Rakib said. The EPB data showed that export earnings from Spain in July-October of FY25, however, declined by 4.48 per cent to $1.18 billion compared with those of $1.24 billion in the same period of the past financial year. Readymade garment exports to Spain in the period also decreased by 5.05 per cent to $1.15 billion compared with those of $1.21 billion. Rakib said that Inditex, the largest buyer in Spain, had embraced the fast fashion model by relocating production closer to key markets, allowing for quicker responses to rapidly changing trends. As part of this strategy, the company has reduced lead times and cut orders to Bangladesh due to its longer production timelines, he said. Bangladesh’s exports to France in July-October of FY25 increased by 10.92 per cent to $789.63 million compared with those of $711.87 million in the same period of FY24. The country’s export earnings from Japan in the first four months of FY24 grew by 3.39 per cent to $488.85 million compared with those of $472.78 million in the same period of FY24. RMG exports to japan in the period increased by 4.09 per cent to $409.44 million compared with those of $393.38 million in the same period of the previous financial year. Bangladesh’s export earnings from India in July-October of FY25 increased by 10.75 per cent to $650.54 million compared with those of $587.39 million in the same period of FY24. Apparel exports to India in the period increased by 13.28 per cent, totalling $279.87 million, the EPB data showed. Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Mohammad Hatem said that while the flow of orders had increased, product prices had declined.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/apparel/251743/exports-to-major-markets-rise-in-july-oct
Policy execution failure one of country’s key problems,"Centre for Policy Dialogue chairman Rehman Sobhan on Sunday said that one of the biggest problems in the country was failure to implement policies. He said that failure to implement policies and ambiguity regarding the government’s willingness to implement policies were the real problems and that needed to be discussed. He made the remarks at a discussion titled ‘The CPD Journey: Commemorating Thirty Years of CPD’, marking CPD’s 30th anniversary held at BRAC Centre Inn, Mohakhali in the capital Dhaka on the day. ‘We wanted to keep the government accountable for how far they were willing to implement their own policies,’ Rehman Sobhan said. ‘However radical or revolutionary you may want to be in terms of reforms, you have to look ahead to see how far they were going to be implemented,’ he added. Sobhan highlighted CPD’s journey and its efforts to ensure the government’s accountability through dialogue. He said that the government was much more sensitive to the part of the process where accountability was to be established. The process of holding them accountable was something about which they were very uncomfortable, he added. He further said that the government was willing to listen and, previously, successive finance ministers over many years were willing to sit with CPD and listen, adding, ‘The word ‘rubbish’ began to be used in the last 7-8 years, when intelligent observations were being made about the process of policy making and its implementation.’ The CPD chairman emphasised involving civil society, including academics, businesses, workers and NGOs, in the policymaking process. He also said that all political crises should be addressed through constructive dialogue. The interim government’s chief adviser Muhammad Yunus, also a CPD trustee member, in a video message said that CPD had always thought independently and helped the policymakers by giving them important advices. Rounaq Jahan, distinguished fellow of CPD, and Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury, BNP standing committee member, among others, were present in the discussion.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/251742/policy-execution-failure-one-of-countrys-key-problems
CPD plays big role in shaping mindset for uprising: Yunus,"Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on Sunday said that Centre for Policy Dialogue’s research and public awareness activities played a huge role in creating the mindset for the recent student uprising. He also said that the research organisation had always been involved in establishing a democratic, just and accountable society. The chief adviser made the remark in a video message played at a programme organised marking the 30th anniversary of the CPD. He said that CPD had been able to establish itself as a reliable and fearless institution for the people of the country through various activities over the past 30 years. ‘That is why this institution always holds special significance for me,’ Yunus said. Noting that Bangladesh was now going through a crucial time, he said, ‘I hope that CPD will continue its intellectual contribution in the present and future as it did so in the past and will contribute to the welfare of the country and its people.’ He wished CPD’s greater role and success in the coming days for the needs of the country. As a founding trustee of CPD, Yunus extended his heartfelt congratulations to all associated with the organisation. ‘Today, I would like to specially congratulate my teacher Rehman Sobhan, founder of CPD. He has been playing a unique role in the country at different times,’ he said. Claiming that CPD had been recognised as a renowned research institution at home and abroad in its long journey of 30 years, the 2006 Nobel Peace Laureate said that CPD had always thought independently, standing against the trend and had tried to provide important advice to policymakers at different times in the interest of the country. ‘The efforts I have made throughout my life to change the overall condition of the country’s people and to eradicate poverty have always been reflected in the works of CPD,’ he said. The chief adviser said that realising the need for dialogue between different groups, CPD organised regular policy dialogues at different times, many of which he had personally attended. He said that CPD policy analysis and research activities had brought a huge change in the overall thinking structure of the country.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/251740/cpd-plays-big-role-in-shaping-mindset-for-uprising-yunus
Remittance rises by 26pc in July-Nov,"Remittance inflow to Bangladesh has maintained a record-breaking trend, staying above $2 billion for the fourth consecutive month in November, according to Bangladesh Bank data. In November, remittance inflow reached $2.19 billion, after posting $2.39 billion in October, $2.4 billion in September, $2.22 billion in August and $1.91 billion in July. The trend marked a significant jump, with remittance inflow for the July-November period of the 2024-25 financial year increasing by 26 per cent to $11.13 billion, compared with that of $8.88 billion in the same period of the previous financial year. Experts attributed this surge to an increased use of official channels, especially state-owned banks, by expatriates in sending money to the country after a major political shift in Bangladesh on August 5. The new government’s efforts to stabilise the financial sector have fostered the expatriates’ trust in state-run institutions, they said. Bankers noted that many remitters had shifted away from private banks due to concerns over liquidity challenges and irregularities that plagued several private institutions during the ousted Awami League regime. This has driven remitters to seek safer options, bolstering state-run banks’ share in remittance handling, they said. In November, the state-owned banks accounted for an impressive 44 per cent of the total remittances, processing $969 million. Their share was 30 per cent in September and 35 per cent in October. Islami Bank Bangladesh, however, led with remittance receipts of $360 million in November, followed by Agrani Bank with $288 million, Janata Bank with $264 million, BRAC Bank with $187 million, Rupali Bank with $153 million, Bangladesh Krishi Bank with $145 million and Sonali Bank with $117 million. Considering the government’s incentive alongside the dollar rate of Tk 120 in the formal channel, expatriates found it more lucrative through formal channels than the informal ones as the dollar price on the kerb market was about Tk 121 each. The interbank dollar rate increased to Tk 120 each after a rise of Tk 7 on May 8. The high dollar rates attracted expatriates to use formal channels for money transfers, avoiding illegal channels like hundi, bankers said. The country’s foreign currency reserve, according to the International Monetary Fund guidelines, dropped to $18.73 billion on November 28. The remittance inflow reached $23.9 billion in FY24, up from $21.6 billion in FY23.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/251739/remittance-rises-by-26pc-in-july-nov
Credit card interest rate limit set at 25pc,"The Bangladesh Bank on Sunday imposed the maximum interest rate for credit card loans, setting it at 25 per cent. The central bank issued a circular in this regard on the day. On January 15, 2023, the BB lifted interest rate cap on credit card loans allowing banks to set interest rate of their credit cards. Earlier on September 24, 2020, the central bank imposed 20 per cent interest rate cap on credit card loans. The BB’s circular on Sunday said that the maximum interest rate on credit cards was revised to 25 per cent to ensure prudent loan risk management and to align with the rising policy interest rate and funding costs for banks. Banks may set credit card interest rates within this limit based on loan demand and the availability of funds, it said. Islamic Shariah-based banks will adjust their profit rates on investments following these revised guidelines, the circular said. The Bangladesh Bank came up with the interest rate ceiling against the backdrop of charging a high interest rate by banks, violating the guidelines on credit card operations issued in 2017. According to the guidelines, for credit card loans, banks can charge the highest interest rate of consumer loans plus 5 per cent. At the same time, credit card customers are allowed to withdraw 50 per cent of their credit limit in cash. Moreover, banks used to charge interest on credit card dues from the first day of a transaction and charge a late fee at a progressive rate on unpaid bills.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/251738/credit-card-interest-rate-limit-set-at-25pc
BB extends FE loan tenure for capital machinery imports,"The Bangladesh Bank has extended the tenure for foreign exchange loans under buyers and suppliers credit for importing capital machinery, allowing industrial entrepreneurs to secure loans for three years instead of one. The central bank has also ordered an extension of loan tenures for institutions with existing medium- and short-term agreements to import capital machinery, while prohibiting any increase in interest rates. The Foreign Exchange and Policy Department of the BB issued a circular in this regard on Sunday. It said that this directive, issued to provide additional incentive for the import of capital machinery, would be applicable only to factories within export processing zones, private export processing zones, economy zones, hi-tech parks and government-declared specialised zones. To get the benefits, registration with the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority and the Textile Department has been made mandatory. The Bangladesh Bank directive further states that the 182nd meeting of the Scrutiny Committee on Bidder Foreign Loans or Suppliers Credit chaired by the governor decided to issue a three-year loan. All the authorised dealer banks in the country have been instructed to take initiatives in this regard to provide additional incentives for the import of capital equipment. In a circular earlier on November 27, the central bank said that the import-dependent industrial sector, which has suffered losses due to the appreciation of the dollar, had been given up to eight years to repay the loan. These loans can be calculated separately and repaid on a monthly or quarterly basis with a one-year break.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/251737/bb-extends-fe-loan-tenure-for-capital-machinery-imports
VW’s German workers to strike from today: union,"Workers at German factories for carmaker Volkswagen are to go on strike from today over plans to cut thousands of jobs, union IG Metall said at the weekend. ‘If need be, it will be the toughest collective bargaining battle Volkswagen has ever seen,’ the union said on Sunday. The crisis-wracked auto titan has been locked in bitter talks with unions since announcing in September that it was mulling the unprecedented step of shuttering plants in Germany, where it has some 1,20,000 employees. VW has been hit hard by high manufacturing costs at home, a stuttering shift to electric vehicles and tough competition in key market China. Ahead of talks last month, the union and VW’s works councils put forward a series of proposals they said would save 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in labour costs without the need for site closures. These included proposals for management and staff to waive bonuses. The union also said it could drop a demand for pay rises in exchange for working shorter hours at some factories. But Volkswagen said it had concluded that, while the measures could help in the short term, they would not lead ‘to any long-term financial relief for the company in the coming years’. IG Metall at the time described VW’s response as ‘extremely regrettable’, accusing it of ‘ignoring the constructive proposals of the employee representatives’.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/251736/vws-german-workers-to-strike-from-today-union

Palestinian leader Abbas lays ground for succession,"Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas on Wednesday announced who would replace him in an interim period when the post becomes vacant, effectively removing the Islamist movement Hamas from any involvement in a future transition. Abbas, 89, still rules despite his term as head of the Palestinian authority ending in 2009, and has resisted pressure to appoint a successor or a vice president. Under current Palestinian law, the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) takes over the Palestinian Authority in the event of a power vacuum. But the PLC, where Hamas had a majority, no longer exists since Abbas officially dissolved it in 2018 after more than a decade of tensions between his secular party, Fatah, and Hamas, which ousted the Palestinian Authority from power in the Gaza Strip in 2007. In a decree, Abbas said the Palestinian National Council chairman, Rawhi Fattuh, would be his temporary replacement should the position should become vacant. ‘If the position of the president of the national authority becomes vacant in the absence of the legislative council, the Palestinian National Council president shall assume the duties. temporarily,’ it said. The decree added that following the transition period, elections must be held within 90 days. This deadline can be extended in the event of a ‘force majeure’, it said. The PNC is the parliament of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which has over 700 members from the Palestinian territories and abroad. Hamas, which does not belong to the PLO, has no representation on the council. The PNC deputies are not elected, but appointed. The decree refers to the ‘delicate stage in the history of the homeland and the Palestinian cause’ as war rages in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, after the latter’s unprecedented attack on southern Israel in October last year. There are also persistent divisions between Hamas and Fatah. The decree comes on the same day that a ceasefire entered into force in Lebanon after an agreement between Israel and Hamas’s ally, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. The Palestinian Authority appears weaker than ever, unable to pay its civil servants and threatened by Israeli far-right ministers’ calls to annex all or part of the occupied West Bank, an ambition increasingly less hidden by the government of Benjamin Netanyahu.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/251727/palestinian-leader-abbas-lays-ground-for-succession

"Establishing justice, accountability top priority of govt: CA press secy","Bangladesh interim government on Sunday reiterated its commitment to establish ‘justice and accountability’ for the wrongdoings done over the past 15 years. ‘It remains a top priority to establish justice and accountability for what happened over the past 15 years. They (committee) carried out a postmortem of the development narrative presenting a horrific picture,’ chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam told reporters at Foreign Service Academy in Dhaka in the evening. He said the 400-page report will hopefully generate huge discussions and debates, leading to more information regarding ‘industrial-scale’ stealing and misuse of taxpayers’ money. ‘I hope it will be a very comprehensive report highlighting all aspects,’ said the press secretary, adding that they will continue to maintain transparency fully. Alam said no body will be spared who were involved in looting public money as the law will take its own course.

He said that the word ‘Cadre’ was perceived negatively so that the commission would recommend its removal. He said that among the reform proposals, the commission planned to recommend writing those services such as civil service (administration), civil service (health) and civil service (agriculture) without using the term ‘cadre’. He termed the issue as a significant reform that could ease the negative perceptions over civil service positions.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251719/reform-commission-for-dropping-cadre-from-civil-service
Tarique’s acquittal proves cases were politically motivated: Fakhrul,"Expressing relief over the High Court’s acquittal of Tarique Rahman in the August 21 grenade attack cases, Bangladesh Nationalist Party secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir stated on Sunday said this verdict has manifested all the cases filed against their party Acting Chairman were politically motivated and conspiratorial. ‘Tarique Rahman was acquitted by the High Court after legally facing the charges brought against him,’ he said in a statement. Fakhrul, now in London, issued the statement following the High Court’s verdict in the two cases filed over the August 21 grenade attack. The judgement has shown that the Awami ‘fascist’ government accused Tarique Rahman in these cases with political motives, he said. ‘Through this historic verdict, it has been demonstrated once again that all the cases filed against Tarique Rahman were political conspiracies,’ Fakhrul said. He expressed his gratitude to Allah for the verdict and called upon party leaders and activists across the country to pray for Tarique’s well-being. Earlier, at a press conference at the BNP’s Nayapaltan central office, party senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi expressed his satisfaction, saying that justice has been served as the High Court acquitted Tarique Rahman and the others convicted in the two cases. Rizvi said when retired police officer Abdul Kahar Akhand was reappointed and made the investigation officer of the cases during the Awami League rule, it became clear to them that the government had malicious intentions. The BNP leader also alleged that the Awami League government had used state power to forcibly convict Tarique Rahman and other BNP leaders in the cases. ‘We have got the proper judgement from the apex court. Some of the justice for which we have been engaged in a long political struggle has been reflected in the verdict,’ he said. Earlier in the day, the High Court had overturned the verdict of a lower court in two cases filed over the August 21 grenade attack, acquitting all convicts, including BNP’s Acting Chairperson Tarique Rahman and former state minister for home affairs Lutfozzaman Babar. An HC bench comprising Justice AKM Asaduzzaman and Justice Syed Enayet Hossain delivered the judgement on Sunday. The court also declared the charge sheet in the case illegal. The grenade attack, a shocking incident, occurred on Dhaka’s Bangabandhu Avenue on August 21, 2004.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251718/tariques-acquittal-proves-cases-were-politically-motivated-fakhrul

Cyclone Fengal pummels India’s south after Sri Lanka,"A cyclone that smashed into India’s southern coastline killed at least three people but otherwise did not cause widespread damage, officials said. Cyclone Fengal made landfall late Saturday with sustained winds of 70-80 kilometres an hour (43-50 miles per hour). Three people were electrocuted as a result of the storm in Chennai, Tamil Nadu state disaster management minister KKSSR Ramachandran told reporters late Saturday. But damage from the cyclone was otherwise ‘minimal’, he added. The Times of India newspaper reported the death toll was four, adding that there was ‘flooding’ and trees falling but ‘not to the extent feared’. Cyclones -- the equivalent of hurricanes in the North Atlantic or typhoons in the northwestern Pacific -- are a regular and deadly menace in the northern Indian Ocean. While the storm is expected to gradually weaken into a depression later Sunday, India’s weather bureau warned of heavy rains across parts of India’s south. It advised a total suspension of fishing operations and also said there was a ‘moderate to high flash flood risk’ in some areas. Fengal skirted the coast of Sri Lanka earlier this week, killing at least 12 people, including six children. Scientists have warned that storms are becoming more powerful as the world heats up due to climate change driven by burning fossil fuels. Warmer ocean surfaces release more water vapour, which provides additional energy for storms, strengthening winds. A warming atmosphere also allows them to hold more water, boosting rainfall. But better forecasting and more effective evacuation planning have dramatically reduced death tolls.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/251714/cyclone-fengal-pummels-indias-south-after-sri-lanka
Harry Kane sidelined with hamstring tear,"Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane has been ruled out ‘for the time being’ with a hamstring tear, the club announced Sunday. Kane was subbed off after 33 minutes in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Borussia Dortmund. The 31-year-old will miss Bayern's home German Cup last 16 clash with holders Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday. Bayern issued a statement on Sunday saying the England captain ‘suffered a small muscle tear in the back of his right thigh’. ‘Bayern will have to do without Harry Kane for the time being.’ German tabloid Bild said Kane was likely to miss two weeks of action. Bayern have five more fixtures remaining in 2024. After Leverkusen's visit, Bayern host Heidenheim before playing Shakhtar Donetsk in Gelsenkirchen, facing Mainz in the Bundesliga and hosting RB Leipzig in the final match of the year. The striker has missed just two games with injury since moving to Bayern in the summer of 2023. At the end of the 2023-24 season, Kane sat out two matches with a back injury. Kane has 20 goals in 19 games in all competitions for the German giants this season. Despite Saturday's draw, Bayern are seven points clear atop the Bundesliga table. In the Champions League, the six-time winners sit in 13th place after five games, with three wins and two losses.

Kane limps off as Bayern rescue draw at Dortmund,"Harry Kane limped off but Jamal Musiala's 85th-minute header salvaged a 1-1 draw for Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich at the home of rivals Borussia Dortmund on Saturday. England captain Kane pulled up with a left thigh issue after 33 minutes, shortly after compatriot Jamie Gittens had opened the scoring for Dortmund. However, Bayern coach Vincent Kompany said he was optimistic Kane's injury was ‘not too bad’ with Tuesday's German Cup last-16 match against holders Leverkusen looming. ‘He (Kane) says it's not too serious. Let's hope so,’ said Kompany with the 31-year-old set to undergo scans. Bayern's seven-point lead can be cut to four when second-placed Eintracht Frankfurt play Heidenheim on Sunday. Dortmund went back above Freiburg, who beat Borussia Moenchengladbach 3-1 on Saturday, into fifth place but remain 10 points behind the leaders. This Klassiker was a meeting between the teams with the best home and away records in the Bundesliga, and always promised to be an entertaining contest. Bayern started the game on top but Dortmund steadied the ship and took the lead in the 27th minute through Gittens' superb individual goal. Dortmund captain Nico Schlotterbeck spotted the run of Gittens, whose stepover left Konrad Laimer in his wake. His searing pace kept him clear of Laimer down the left flank and he finished expertly past Manuel Neuer. It was a moment of brilliance from the Englishman and a repayment to coach Nuri Sahin for the faith he has shown in the 20-year-old, handing him 14 starts already this season. It was also the first goal Bayern had conceded since October 23, breaking a run of clean sheets that had stretched back eight games in all competitions. Bayern's problems were compounded five minutes later with the loss of Kane but Neuer kept the Bavarians in the game keeping out a Marcel Sabitzer shot with his right leg just after the hour mark. Bayern controlled much of the second half but could not convert their ball superiority into goals, until Bayern's best player on the night Musiala secured a point. Leroy Sane's free-kick struck the Dortmund wall, Sane found Michael Olise, whose pinpoint cross was nodded in by Musiala. ‘We're happy to have come back, I think we deserved it,’ said Thomas Mueller, Kane’s replacement from the bench. Earlier, Patrik Schick scored the winner as Bayer Leverkusen edged Union Berlin 2-1 to keep Bayern in sight. Leverkusen had flown out of the blocks, taking the lead inside two minutes through Jeremie Frimpong before Jeong Woo-yeong struck back for the hosts to restore parity before the break. But the champions found a winner in the 71st minute, with Czech forward Schick meeting Florian Wirtz's cross to settle a finely balanced game in their favour. Wolfsburg pulled off a shock 5-1 win at RB Leipzig, giving former Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl a triumphant return to his former club. Leipzig endured a nightmare start, with Wolfsburg leading 2-0 inside the first five minutes. Algerian striker Mohamed Amoura opened the scoring in the fourth minute, with Tiago Tomas doubling the advantage a minute later. Amoura added his second after 16 minutes, and Joakim Maehle piled on the misery for the hosts after the break. Leipzig captain Willi Orban tapped in a late consolation, but it was too little, too late, as Leipzig conceded four for the second consecutive league game and are now winless in six games, including four in the league, after their fast start to the season, slipping to fourth. In contrast, Wolfsburg have climbed to seventh and are unbeaten in their last five league games. Elsewhere, Freiburg held off Borussia Moenchengladbach to win 3-1 and bounce back from their 4-0 trouncing in Dortmund last weekend. In Bremen, Stuttgart striker Ermedin Demirovic scored a brace as the visitors twice fought back to secure a 2-2 draw. A first-half penalty by Phillip Tietz gave Augsburg a 1-0 win over Bochum, who remain rooted to the bottom of the table with two points.

Ten-man Botafogo win Copa Libertadores,"Botafogo won the Copa Libertadores for the first time in their history with a 3-1 victory over fellow Brazilians Atletico Mineiro on Saturday. Botafogo played almost the entire match with ten men after Gregore was sent off in the first minute but they showed impressive spirit and resilience to secure victory at River Plate's Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires. It is the sixth straight season that a Brazilian club has won the Libertadores, the top competition for South American clubs. The 120-year-old Botafogo, the Rio club who have twice won the Brazilian championship, have a rich history, including producing greats such as World Cup winners Garrincha, Didi, Nilton Santos and Mario Zagallo. But they have long suffered taunts from their rivals about their failure to win the continental title -- a jibe that can be made no more. Midfielder Gregore was shown a red card after a wild, high challenge on Fauto Vera, forcing Botafogo to adjust their game plan, but Atletico failed to press home their numerical advantage. Veteran forward Hulk had an effort from outside the box saved by John but the team from Belo Horizonte created little pressure. Sensing the game might not be the rearguard action they might have expected, Botafogo began to show more attacking intent and they were rewarded in the 35th minute. Marlon Freitas's shot from the edge of the box ricocheted around a crowded box before the ball fell to Luiz Henrique, who fired home from close range. To their credit, Botafogo didn't retreat to defend their slim advantage and they were able to double their lead in the 44th minute. Atletico defender Guilherme Arana attempted to shepherd the ball back to goalkeeper Everson, but Luiz Henrique snuck between the pair and went down under challenge from the keeper. After a VAR review, a penalty was awarded and Alex Telles confidently smashed home the spot kick to give Botafogo an unlikely 2-0 lead at the break. Atletico, who won the Libertadores in 2013, made a triple substitution at the interval and it paid off swiftly with Eduardo Vargas heading in from a corner. Inevitably, there was late pressure from Atletico, but Botafogo made sure of the victory when Junior Santos finished off a counter-attack deep in stoppage time. With the win, Botafogo earns the final of 32 places in next year's FIFA Club World Cup to be held in the United States. The club, owned by American businessman John Textor, also has a chance to complete a double by winning what would be their third Brazilian league title -- they currently lead Serie A by three points with two games remaining. Luis Henrique, whose fine form this season has seen him break into the Brazil squad, said the win was an emotional one for him and the team. ‘Many people tried to stop me, but I know that God is with me, my family is with me, and I have to keep my feet on the ground because there is still more to come,’ the 23-year-old striker said. ‘I want to thank Botafogo a lot, Botafogo needs to be at the top, because it's a club that has been working hard, that has been doing a lot on a daily basis.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/251709/ten-man-botafogo-win-copa-libertadores
"Illicit money flow, rampant corruption plagued Bangladesh economy under AL regime","The country lost $16 billion annually on an average between 2009 and 2023 because of the illicit fund flow amid systemic tax evasion, misuse of exemptions, and poorly managed public finances under the authoritarian Awami League regime ousted amid a mass uprising on August 5.  The illicit financial outflows are more than double the combined value of net foreign aid and Foreign Direct Invest, according to the White Paper on the State of Bangladesh Economy, submitted to chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on Sunday by a 12-member committee headed by economist Debapriya Bhattacharya. The white paper, underscoring the significant fiscal opportunities lost to corruption, stated that halving tax exemptions could double education funding and triple health allocations. Income tax exemptions were granted to selected large conglomerates,  including Summit Group for its Liquefied Natural Gas terminal and 15 power plants, S Alam Group for its coal-based power plants and BEXIMCO Group for its Sukuk Bond, according to the white paper. The white paper also highlighted that $14–24 billion was lost to political extortion, bribery, and inflated budgets with the annual development programme projects worth $60 billion in the past 15 years. Chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam in a briefing on the day said that the chief adviser was stunned by the plundering of public money during the AL regime. Calling the white paper an autopsy of misappropriation of public funds by the authoritarian regime, he said that the interim government would start meetings with international agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States from December 10 to bring back the stolen assets. On August 29, the white paper committee was appointed after the interim government assumed power on August 8, three days after deposed prime minister Shekh Hasina fled to India on August 5. Exploring the overall economy left behind by the AL regime in 23 chapters, the 385-page white paper revealed that protracted periods of deceptive data, lax financial management, reckless macroeconomic management, public finance pilferage, and external sector imbalances had created deep wounds in the economy. The deceptive economic outcome indicators, coupled with serious institutional flaws in sectors like banking, non-banking financial institutions, capital market and the energy sector are linked to the launch of overpriced mega projects and the huge outflow of illicit finance, said the white paper. The white paper showed that the lack of democratic accountability from the fraudulent national elections of 2014, 2018 and 2024 shaped the authoritarian government that promoted collusion between the ruling politicians, a section of the bureaucrats and certain business elites for its sustainability. It also said that the unholy alliance eroded institutional integrity of legislature, executive and the judiciary and paralyzed the non-state actors like media, civil society and private sectors, through intimidation, self-censorship and cooption leading to the rise of the oligarchs who ruled the political governance and economic management. ‘Consequently, the government lost its policy sovereignty. These oligarchs influenced and manipulated key facets of the economy to serve their vested interests, concealed by an illusory development narrative sustained by inflated and misleading data,’ said the paper. Identifying two dozen channels of corruption, the paper puts the banking sector on top of the most corruption-ravaged sector, followed by physical infrastructure and energy and power while information and communication technology was also identified as one of the most corruption-affected sectors by its operational and technological novelty. The banking sector crises have deepened due to politically influenced lending practices overburdened with distressed assets of Tk 6.75 lakh crore as of June 2024, equivalent to the cost of constructing 14 Dhaka metro rail systems or 24 Padma Bridges, according to the paper. ‘The S Alam Group alone took about Tk 2 lakh crore from the banks,’ said the white paper. The paper also said that manipulated domestic production figures and understated demand for key commodities, such as rice, edible oil, and wheat, had destabilised markets while erratic and politically influenced procurement policies benefited powerful business groups and exacerbated consumer hardships due to almost double-digit inflation over the past two years. The paper identified that  Tk 13.4 lakh crore had been funnelled through hundi transactions in the past decade by recruiting agencies for visa purchases — an amount four times the cost of constructing Dhaka metro rail between Uttara and Motijheel. The paper classified 73 per cent of social safety net beneficiaries as non-poor until 2022. Receiving the white paper, the chief adviser thanked the committee for doing a landmark, saying it should be published once it is finalised and be taught in textbooks in national college and university curriculum according to the press wing of the chief adviser. Committee member Mustafizur Rahman said that they examined seven large projects costing over Tk 10,000 crore each and found that the initial estimate of Tk 1,14,000 crore was revised to Tk 1,95,000 crore, recording  70 per cent increase by adding many components, showing an inflated land price, and manipulating the purchase. This happened without analysing the cost benefit, he said, adding that total expenses on 29 large projects were $87 billion, or Tk 7,80,000 crore. Committee member AK Enamul Haque said that in the past 15 years over Tk 7,00,000 crore was spent on the ADP, and 40 per cent of the money was plundered by bureaucrats. M Tamim, another member of the committee, said that $30 billion was invested on power generation, and if the kickback was considered 10 per cent, the amount would be at least $3 billion.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251708/illicit-money-flow-rampant-corruption-plagued-bangladesh-economy-under-al-regime
Debutant Bethell leads England to eight-wicket win over New Zealand,"England blazed to an eight-wicket victory in the first Test against New Zealand Sunday, knocking off their 104-run target in just 12.4 overs of their second innings. After bowling out New Zealand for 254 on day four in Christchurch, debutant Jacob Bethell scored the winning run to reach a maiden Test 50 off 37 deliveries with eight fours and a six. Joe Root was not out 23 off 15 balls at the other end. ‘Very happy with the way we performed throughout the week,’ said England captain Ben Stokes after his side took a 1-0 lead in the three-Test series. ‘Our bowlers were relentless throughout.’ New Zealand resumed on 155-6 in their second innings, a lead of four runs, and frustrated England for more than two hours to reach 254, a lead of 103. Daryl Mitchell, 31 overnight, scored a defiant 84 and put on a stubborn 13-over partnership for the last wicket worth 45 runs with Will O'Rourke (five not out). England's Brydon Carse took six second-innings wickets to finish with 10 in a Test for the first time. The 104-run target was never going to be enough to stop England, who sealed the Test midway through the afternoon session. They lost Zak Crawley in the second over, caught and bowled by Matt Henry for one, and Ben Duckett caught by Henry off O'Rourke for a rapid 27 off 18 balls before Bethell and Root took over. The home defeat evaporated New Zealand's euphoria from their recent 3-0 sweep in India and all but ended their hopes of a berth in the World Test Championship final. Through the first two sessions of the Test, the Black Caps had the upper hand, despite losing the toss, as they reached 199-3 on a seamers' wicket. Even when they were all out for 348 and England were 71-4 in reply the momentum was with New Zealand. But from there the game turned England's way with belligerent batting aided by sloppy fielding, which included eight dropped catches. When New Zealand batted again, a masterful seam bowling session by Chris Woakes and player-of-the-match Carse tilted the match firmly back to England. ‘We were happy with the position we had, and we had our opportunities,’ said New Zealand captain Tom Latham ‘On a different day, catches go to hand and things might be different, but that's the sport we play.’ England's first innings 499 gave them an imposing 151 run-lead, but had New Zealand taken their catches it could have been a different scenario. Harry Brook was dropped on 18, Stokes was put down on 50 and added 30 more, a catch off Duckett was spilt on 25 and he went on to make 46, while Carse finished 33 not out after escaping on six. ‘Catches win matches,’ said Brook as he reflected on the five lives he had on his way to 171. Brook then caught opener Latham at the start of the New Zealand second innings to give Woakes his first wicket. In a one-and-a-half sessions on Saturday, New Zealand lost six wickets as Woakes and Carse found movement with the ball. After removing Latham, Woakes bagged New Zealand's premier batsman Kane Williamson for 61 and Tom Blundell in consecutive deliveries. Carse chipped in with the wickets of Devon Conway, Rachin Ravindra and Glenn Phillips. In the first session Sunday, Carse removed Nathan Smith and Henry in the same over. Smith advanced from his overnight one to 21, playing through a barrage of short deliveries before a fuller ball from Carse nipped back and rapped into his pads. Four balls later the 29-year-old Carse, in only his third Test, accounted for Henry (one) with a similar delivery. He came back later to end the innings with Mitchell's wicket to finish with an impressive Test-best 6-42. Woakes took 3-59 with the other wicket taken by Gus Atkinson, who was hit for two sixes by Tim Southee before the tall New Zealander was caught on the boundary swinging for a third. The second Test starts in Wellington on Friday. The third and final Test is in Hamilton, beginning December 14.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251707/debutant-bethell-leads-england-to-eight-wicket-win-over-new-zealand

Sloppy Windies let Bangladesh off the hook,"Poor West Indies catching let Bangladesh off the hook with the visitors closing a curtailed day one of the second and final Test at 69-2 after opting to bat first at the Sabina Park in Jamaica on Saturday. Opener Shadman Islam, one of two changes to the Bangladesh side thrashed by 201 runs in the first Test in Antigua a few days earlier, ended the brief session unbeaten on 50 in partnership with Shahadat Hossain (12 not out). Shadman’s fifth Test half-century has so far occupied exactly 100 deliveries with the opener stroking three fours and then hoisting a six off Kavem Hodge as the home side opted for part-time spinners in fading light. After senior pacer Kemar Roach rocked the tourists with the wickets of Mahmudul Hasan Joy and Mominul Haque to have them stuttering at ten for two, Islam and Joy featured in an unbroken stand of 59. However both were beneficiaries of the home side’s increasingly deplorable catching record in this brief series. Left-hander Shadman was missed by Kraigg Brathwaite at short-extra cover off all-rounder Justin Greaves. That error spoiled a celebratory day for the West Indies captain, for whom this match was his 86th Test in a row, eclipsing the mark of 85 by fellow Barbadian Sir Garfield Sobers as the most consecutive Tests played for the West Indies. Shahadat was then missed by the Dominican combination of Alick Athanaze and Hodge in the slips as both juggled and then dropped an edged drive off frustrated fast bowler Jayden Seales. ‘It’s just about pegging away, just to keep challenging guys on the front foot,’ said Roach in describing his tactics at the end of the day to have Joy and Mominul caught by wicketkeeper Joshua da Silva. ‘It’s been a pretty even day for us.’ Those two wickets lifted Roach’s tally of Test victims against Bangladesh to 50 while his overall haul stands at 279 going into day two. Torrential rain over the previous three days in the Jamaican capital left damp areas around the square and delayed the start of play until mid-afternoon despite relentless sunshine through the morning.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251705/sloppy-windies-let-bangladesh-off-the-hook
BNP not an obstacle to AL ban: Rizvi,"The Bangladesh Nationalist Party senior joint secretary general, Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, on Sunday said it was not correct that their party was a barrier to banning the Awami League. ‘Some in the interim government are propagating through their remarks and statements that BNP is an obstacle to banning the Awami League, which is not correct,’ he told a press conference at BNP’s Nayapaltan central office. The BNP leader said that the government held the sole authority to decide whether to ban the Awami League or not. ‘It is regrettable to blame BNP for this,’ Rizvi bemoaned. He mentioned that their party had also protested when the Awami League government banned Jamaat. ‘We hope that the interim government, including the chief advisor and other advisers, will refrain from making statements that weaken the democratic forces or create divisions in our unity,’ Rizvi said. He said BNP Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman has already urged the interim government to take urgent steps to ensure the political and economic empowerment of the people. ‘Earn the trust of the people. Stay in their trust. The national unity against autocracy has been forged through the blood of several thousands of students,’ the BNP leader said.

Trump picks Indian-origin Kash Patel to lead FBI,"US President-elect Donald Trump aims to make loyalist Kash Patel the next director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, he said on Saturday, in a move that would mean replacing the agency’s current leader. Trump announced the former adviser and Pentagon official, who has been critical of the bureau and is known for his controversial views on a so-called government ‘deep state,’ as his choice for the post on his Truth Social network. The FBI’s current director, Christopher Wray, was appointed to a 10-year term in 2017, meaning he would either need to step down or be fired. The FBI under Wray -- who Trump appointed -- has investigated the incoming president, sparking Trump’s ire. ‘Kash is a brilliant lawyer, investigator and ‘America First’ fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People,’ Trump wrote on Truth Social. A fierce defender of the incoming president, Patel supports the Republican hardliner notion of an anti-Trump ‘deep state’ of allegedly biased government bureaucrats working to stifle Trump from behind the scenes, even having written a book on the subject. A son of Indian immigrants, Patel served in several high-level posts during Trump’s first term including as a national security adviser and as chief of staff to the acting defense secretary. ‘Kash did an incredible job during my First Term,’ Trump said, adding that the nominee would work to ‘end the growing crime epidemic in America, dismantle the migrant criminal gangs, and stop the evil scourge of human and drug trafficking across the Border.’ Wray was tapped by Trump during his first term, replacing an acting director after Trump fired former FBI director James Comey. Comey had angered Trump with an FBI investigation into the president’s extensive ties to Russia. The FBI under Wray went on to investigate Trump himself -- searching his Mar-a-Lago estate in 2022 for illegally retained top secret documents. Trump has long derided the bureau’s investigations, including its probes into hundreds of his supporters who violently stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. In a statement to CNN, the FBI said that Wray’s ‘focus remains on the men and women of the FBI, the people we do the work with, and the people we do the work for.’ Separately, Trump nominated Chad Chronister, a Florida sheriff, as administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which the president-elect erroneously referred to as the Drug Enforcement Agency. ‘Chad will work with our great Attorney General, Pam Bondi, to secure the Border, stop the flow of Fentanyl, and other Illegal Drugs, across the Southern Border, and SAVE LIVES,’ Trump wrote on Truth Social. Bondi, a staunch Trump ally and former Florida attorney general, is the president-elect’s pick to lead the Department of Justice. The FBI is the investigative arm of the Department of Justice, while the DEA also falls under its purview.

BNP standing committee member Mosharraf acquitted in graft case,"A Dhaka court has acquitted Bangladesh Nationalist Party standing committee member and former health minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain in a case filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission over alleged accumulation of wealth beyond known sources of income. Judge Md Monjurul Hossain of Dhaka’s Special Judge Court-8 delivered the judgment on Sunday in the presence of Mosharraf. Following the verdict, the BNP leader said that the case had been filed with the intention of harassment. His lawyer said the prosecution failed to present any evidence to substantiate the allegations of illegal wealth accumulation. The ACC filed the case against Mosharraf in 2008 on charges of amassing wealth beyond known income sources and concealing asset information. The charge-sheet in the case was submitted later that year in November.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/251701/bnp-standing-committee-member-mosharraf-acquitted-in-graft-case

Punishment of Saad supporters demanded for attacking devotees,"A group of Islamic scholars on Sunday demanded punishment for the Saad-led Tabligh faction on charge of an attack on Tabligh Jamaat people on the Biswa Ijtema ground at Tongi near the city in 2018. They said that at least 5,000 people were injured and 50 vehicles were vandalised and set on fire during the one-sided attack by the supporters of Indian Tabligh Jamaat chief Muhammad Saad Kandhlawi. They said that justice was not served in past six years and demanded government to bring the involved persons in the attack under book immediately. Ulema Mashayekh Bangladesh, a platform of a group of Islamic scholars and leaders, raised the demand at a press conference held at the National Press Club marking the 6-year of the incident. In a written statement, Mufti Amanul Haque from the platform said that Saad supporters brutally attacked on tablighi people and madrassah students and teachers while preparing the Ijtema ground at Tongi on December 1 in 2018 to grasp the leadership. Amanul claimed that Saad faction and Awami League leaders and law enforcement officials were involved behind the attack. Awami government did not take any steps to bring the attackers and involved persons to book despite promising several times, said Amanul, adding that the victims are optimistic about justice now as the Awami fascist regime has ended end. Amanul said that they demanded the interim government take steps for an investigation within the shortest time by a judicial inquiry commission into the attack. ‘The perpetrators must be identified and justice must be ensured,’ said Amanul. Responding to a New Age question, Maulana Shahriar Mahmud said that a case was filed in connection to the attack but the AL suppressed it. ‘Filing a fresh case in connection to the attack is under process,’ said Shahriar. Maulana Abdul Hamid, Maulana Nazmul Hasan, Mufti Kifayat Ullah Azhari, Maulana Masudul Karim and Maulana Lokman Mazhari, among others were present at the press conference.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251699/punishment-of-saad-supporters-demanded-for-attacking-devotees
Bangladeshi people express concern over price hike: VoA survey,"Many people in Bangladesh believe that the interim government has faced challenges in managing the rising prices of essential commodities compared to the previous Awami League government, says a survey conducted by Voice of America Bangla. The survey, involving 1,000 participants aged 18 and above from eight divisions across the country, reveales that 44.7 per cent of respondents believe the government has performed poorly in controlling the prices of essential commodities such as rice, fish, vegetables, eggs, meat and oil. Among the people polled, 23.8 per cent believe the current government is performing better than the previous one. Around one-third of the participants—30.8 per cent—feel that the situation has remained unchanged. A gender disparity was noted in the survey regarding opinions. While 31.3 per cent of males felt the interim government was doing better than the previous government, only 16.3 per cent of females shared this view. According to the survey, 41.2 per cent of females believed the situation had remained the same, compared to just 20.3 per cent of male respondents. The survey sample was representative of Bangladesh’s demographics, with equal numbers of male and female respondents. Besides, 92.7 per cent of the participants identified as Muslim. Over 50 per cent of the participants were aged under 34, and nearly a quarter lived in urban areas. Inflation stood at 9.72 per cent in June 2024, rising to 10.87 per cent by October. This period has witnessed political turmoil in the government. However, inflation did not suddenly spike due to political instability in July 2024, even though it reached its highest point of the year—11.66 per cent—that month. Inflation had fluctuated between 5 per cent and 6 per cent in 2020 and 2021. But, from mid-2022, inflation began to rise, crossing 9 per cent in 2023 and nearing 10 per cent, according to Bangladesh Bank data. After the interim government assumed power in August, inflationary pressure on essential commodities persisted. While inflation decreased slightly in September, it climbed again to nearly 11 per cent in October. Since taking power, the current government has implemented several measures aimed at controlling inflation, such as reducing import duties on essential goods like rice, potatoes, sugar, oil, and onions. The margin for opening letters of credit for various imports has been halved, making imports easier. Additionally, market monitoring and surveillance of key players in the supply chain are being conducted. Since 2022, Bangladesh Bank has gradually raised interest rates to reduce demand and control inflation. In October 2024, the bank rate was increased to 10 per cent.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/commodities/251698/bangladeshi-people-express-concern-over-price-hike-voa-survey

"HC acquits Tarique, Babar, all others in Aug 21 grenade attack case","The High Court on Sunday overturned the convictions of 49 individuals, including Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting chairman Tarique Rahman and former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar in two cases of August 21, 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally. The bench of Justice AKM Asaduzzaman and Justice Syed Enayet Hossain declared the 2018 trial court verdict illegal, citing multiple legal inconsistencies.  The grenade attack killed 24 people, including Ivy Rahman, a senior AL leader and wife of late president Zillur Rahman. The then leader of the opposition and AL president Sheikh Hasina narrowly survived the attack but suffered hearing damage. Two cases — one for murder and another under the Explosive Substances Act — were filed by the police against unidentified people for the attack on August 22, 2004. The court observed that in 2011, during the Awami League regime, 30 additional individuals, including Tarique Rahman, Lutfozzaman Babar, former prime minister Khaleda Zia’s political secretary Harris Chowdhury, Jamaat-e-Islami leader Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mujahid, who was executed in war crime case, and former National Security Intelligence director general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury were named in a supplementary chargesheet. ‘This inclusion in the supplementary charge sheet on the basis of a second confessional statement of Harkat-ul-Jihad leader Mufti Abdul Hannan lacked legal validity,’ the court said. The bench found illegal the second confession of Mufti Abdul Hannan, recorded after alleged custodial torture. Hannan, who was later executed in another case, was among the 28 accused named in the initial chargesheet. The police submitted two charge sheets — one in 2008 naming 28 individuals, and the supplementary charge sheet in 2011 adding 30 more people. The court observed that the supplementary charge sheet was sent directly to the Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge’s Court bypassing the legal requirement of submission to a magistrate. The court criticised the further investigation conducted by senior superintendent of police Abul Kahar Akand on an order issued by the trial court on August 3, 2009. Although ordered by the Dhaka Speedy Trial Tribunal-1 to trace the source and suppliers of the grenades, the supplementary investigation remained silent on this crucial aspect, the High Court observed. It observed that none of the 225 prosecution witnesses identified anyone who hurled or carried the grenades, despite some grenades being recovered from the scene. At the outset of verdict delivery which lasted for nearly one hour, the bench informed defence lawyers SM Shajahan and Mohammad Shishir Manir that the full text of the verdict would likely be available within a week. Attorney general Md Asaduzzaman told New Age that his office would decide on filing an appeal after reviewing the full verdict, analysing its reasoning and consulting with the government. Deputy attorney general Md Jashim Sarker, who strongly defended the trial court verdict during the five-day hearing, had argued for its complete upholding. Following the High Court acquittal of all 49 convicts, Jashim stated that he advised the attorney general to file an appeal, highlighting the key findings of the observations. Lawyers SM Shajahan and Kayser Kamal emphasised the need for identification and prosecution of the actual perpetrators through an impartial and thorough investigation. ‘There is no doubt that the grenade attack is a grave incident, but the court has no option but to acquit the accused if they are not linked to the crime,’ said SM Shahjahan. Drawing on his 18 years of experience handling the case from the lower court to the High Court, he criticised the investigation for failing to pursue the real offenders, resulting in the arrest and forced confessions of innocent individuals. Shahjahan further suggested that the Appellate Division could consider ordering a reinvestigation if necessary. ‘Had the investigation been free from political influence, it could have unearthed the real offenders and ensured justice,’ he added. Kayser Kamal echoed the demand for a thorough investigation, stating that the public has a right to know the truth about the attack. He accused Sheikh Hasina of not cooperating with investigators by refusing to allow forensic examination of her car. He also claimed that during the BNP rule, the investigation had the highest level of cooperation, including the involvement of an FBI team and a Supreme Court judge. Both the lawyers stressed the importance of holding the true perpetrators accountable to deliver justice and restore public confidence in the legal system. The death reference and appeals had initially been heard by the High Court bench of Justice Shahidul Karim and Justice Md Akhtaruzzaman. That bench reviewed depositions of 225 witnesses in 18 months and adjourned the hearing on August 18, 2024, citing the need for the state law officers’ preparation after the ouster of Sheikh Hasina as the prime minister and her subsequent fleeing to India amid a student-people uprising on August 5. Chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed later reassigned the case to the bench of Justice AKM Asaduzzaman and Justice Syed Enayet Hossain, where the fresh hearing began on October 31. On October 10, 2018, the Dhaka Speedy Trial Tribunal 1 sentenced 19 individuals, including Babar to death, 19 people, including Tarique, to imprisonment for life term and 11 others to imprisonment for varying terms. All the 30 accused named in the second charge-sheet were jailed. Tarique, the eldest son of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, was tried in his absence, as he has been residing in London since 2008. Kayser noted that Tarique was acquitted of charges in 39 cases. Tarique, however, faces five more cases in which he has been sentenced, he said The 12 fugitive convicts in the August 21 grenade attack case, including Tarique, did not appeal against the trial court verdict. The elven government servants of the new 30 accused in the second charge sheet who received varying terms jail sentences include former inspectors general of police Ashraful Islam, Shahudul Hoque and Khodabox Chowdhury, former major general ATM Amin, former lieutenant commander of Bangladesh Navy Saiful Islam Duke, who is also Khaleda Zia’ nephew, former army colonel Saiful Islam Joarder, former deputy inspector general Khan Sayeed Hasan, former deputy commissioner of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police Obaidur Rahman Khan, former superintendent of police Ruhul Amin, and additional SPs Abdur Rashid and Munshi Atiqur Rahman. The last three were investigation officers of the cases during BNP regime. The convicted police officers were on bail. The trial court had handed death sentences to Babar, former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu, his brother Maulana Tajuddin, Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury, former brigadier general Abdur Rahim, who died later, extremist suspects Maulana Sheikh Abdus Salam, Yusuf Butt alias Majid Butt, Abdul Malek alias Golam Mohammad, Maulana Shawkat Osman, Mohibullah alias Mofizur Rahman alias Ovi, Maulana Abu Sayeed alias Dr Abu Zafar, Abul Kalam Azad alias Bulbul, Jahangir Alam, Maulana Abu Taher, and Hossain Ahammed Tamim, Mufti Moinuddin Sheikh alias Abu Zandal alias Masum Billah, Rafikul Islam alias Rashed alias Sabuj and Mohammad Ujjal alias Ratan and transport owner Md Hanif. Besides Tarique, the political figures who were sentenced to life term imprisonment were Haris Chowdhury, who died later, and former BNP lawmaker Qazi Shah Mofazzal Hossain Kaikobad. Jahangir Alam Alias Badar, Mohammad Iqbal, Mohibul Muttakin, Ratul Ahmed Basu, Mufti Shafikur Rahman, Maulana Liton Alias Zobir alias Delwar, Mufti Abdul Hai, Anisul Mursalin, Md Khalilur Rahman, Maulana Abu Bakar alias Selim Howlader sentenced to life imprisonment remained fugitives. Of the 19 life term recipients Maulana Abdur Rouf, Ariful Islam Arif, Shahadatullah Jewel, Maulana Sabbir Ahmed alias Abdul Hannan Sabbir, Asif Hasan alias Sujan alias Abdul Razzak, and Maulana Yahya are in custody. Md Jalal, branded as ‘Joj Miah,’ spent four years in jail after being falsely implicated in the August 21, 2004 grenade attack case. His wrongful detention highlighted flaws in the investigation during the BNP regime. Jalal, a resident of Senbagh, Noakhali, was imprisoned from June 10, 2005, to June 27, 2009. He was exonerated of murder charges after CID superintendent Fazlul Kabir submitted the first charge sheet on June 9, 2008. After the Awami League assumed power in January 2009, the investigation was expanded further, leading to two charge sheets implicating 49 individuals. The trial began shortly thereafter, uncovering the extent of the initial cover-up.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251696/hc-acquits-tarique-babar-all-others-in-aug-21-grenade-attack-case
Dhaka becomes 5th most polluted city with AQI score of 193,"On the first workday of the week, Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, ranked the fifth on the list of cities with the worst air quality with an AQI score of 193 at 8:50m on Sunday morning.

Conduct on court premises often falls short of ideals: CJ,"Chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed on Saturday emphasised the need for upholding the dignity of the legal profession, pointing out that conduct on court premises has often failed to meet the high ideals expected of it. Speaking at a workshop titled ‘Practicality of Law Practice’ organised by the Supreme Court Bar Association in its auditorium, the chief justice urged newly inducted members of the legal fraternity to approach their responsibilities with the seriousness and commitment the profession demands. ‘The Supreme Court is not merely a seat of justice but the custodian of the constitution, the protector of rights, and the conscience of the nation. Recent incidents have reminded us that conduct on these premises has, at times, fallen short of the ideals we hold dear,’ he said. The chief justice called upon lawyers to restore the dignity of the profession, ensuring that the bar remains a beacon of integrity, professionalism, and justice. ‘This is not the Supreme Court Bar we envision. It is upon each of you to uplift its stature and preserve its role as a cornerstone of justice,’ he said. The chief justice underscored the challenges of practising law but stressed the importance of courage, integrity, and a steadfast commitment to justice. ‘Together, as bench and bar, we must stand as firm guardians of justice and equity, ensuring that the rule of law continues to guide our society, not just for today but for generations to come,’ he said. The event was attended by Appellate Division judge Justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury, High Court judge, Justice Farah Mahbub, attorney general Md Asaduzzaman, the association president, AM Mahbub Uddin Khokon, and senior lawyer Zainul Abedin, among others. Justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury called on lawyers to work collectively to rebuild public confidence in the judiciary, emphasising the importance of professional integrity and conduct both inside and outside the courtroom. ‘Engage in politics if you want to, but keep it outside courts. Inside the courtroom, you are the learned members of the bar, bound by the ethics and responsibilities of this noble profession,’ he said, while delivering a lecture on professional decorum and courtroom behavior. Justice Zubayer stressed the need for lawyers to maintain collegiality, irrespective of political affiliations. ‘You may engage in legal battles within the courtroom, but outside your interactions must be marked by mutual respect and friendliness,’ he added. Attorney general Asaduzzaman stressed the importance of state attorneys’ prioritising their responsibility to assist the courts in upholding the rule of law, rather than blindly defending government actions. ‘It disrespects the legal profession if state attorneys believe their sole duty is to justify every government action before the court,’ Asaduzzaman said. He highlighted the misconception that the primary role of state attorneys was to oppose defendants’ cases and validate all government decisions. ‘The Attorney General’s Office is not an extension of the government, but an institution for the state, representing the legal interests of Bangladesh,’ he clarified. Urging professionalism and integrity, Asaduzzaman reminded state lawyers that their primary responsibility is to properly present the law and its interpretations. ‘As lawyers, your duty is to assist the court in establishing justice, not to serve partisan interests,’ he stated. The attorney general also advised against unnecessary legal actions that burden the judiciary. ‘There is no need to file appeals against every High Court bail order. I have instructed my colleagues to avoid such appeals, which has significantly reduced the number of criminal miscellaneous cases in the Appellate Division.’ He further instructed state attorneys not to oppose cases where it is apparent that justice seekers are being unnecessarily harassed. ‘If courts deliver verdicts seemingly favouring the government, but their reasoning risks setting a problematic legal precedent, it is your duty as state attorneys to draw the court’s attention to these concerns,’ he added. He also emphasised maintaining decorum in court proceedings. ‘Misbehaviour with the courts undermines the dignity of the legal profession. Such conduct is unacceptable from state attorneys,’ he warned.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251686/conduct-on-court-premises-often-falls-short-of-ideals-cj

Business leaders urge action,"Business leaders have urged the government to take immediate steps to improve the law and order situation, and ensure energy supply to address their challenges in operating business activities. They also said that automating and reforming revenue management, reducing costs of doing business and introducing supportive trade policies were urgent for maintaining economic stability. They made the remarks in a business conference titled ‘Private Sector Outlook; Expectations and Priorities’ organised by the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry at a hotel in Dhaka on Saturday. DCCI president Ashraf Ahmed emphasised the need to reduce government expenditure, improve market management, and prevent extortion in goods management. He also called for gradual reductions in policy interest rates, ensuring low-cost credit for CMSMEs, and automating business processes. ‘Uninterrupted gas and electricity supply is mandatory to remain competitive internationally, and improving law and order must be a priority,’ he said. Finance adviser Salehuddin Ahmed highlighted pervasive corruption in the economic sector over the past 15 years, terming it unimaginable. ‘Customers’ deposits have been taken away from banks — a rare example in Bangladesh. The interim government is continuing its efforts to make up it, though it may take some time,’ he said. Mohammad Hatem, president of Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, called for a zero-tolerance policy to tackle the law and order situation. He suggested postponing the country’s graduation from the least developed country list, arguing that the decision to graduating was based on inaccurate data. ‘We are now struggling to survive,’ he said, pointing to declining imports and reduced value addition in manufacturing. Commerce adviser Sheikh Bashiruddin, however, called for better coordination between the government and the private sector to improve the law and order situation. Addressing trade policies, he said, ‘There is no alternative to increasing our capacity to expand our trade in the international market.’ He emphasised liberalising trade and increasing government spending to ensure social justice while focusing on tax collection to improve living standards. PRAN-RFL Group chairman Ahsan Khan Chowdhury stressed improving law and order — a key to business development. He noted that disruption in opening letters of credit were harming production and employment. Ahsan Khan further said that it was necessary to reduce the interest rate on loans considering the existing situation. ‘Opening LC’s are important for business, as well as economic development. And if interest rates are increased further, business would face immense loss,’ he said. Showkat Aziz Russell, president of Bangladesh Textile Mills Association, identified industrial waste management and corruption as significant challenges for businesses. He called for reducing dependency on expensive imported gas, adding that it reduces business capacity. Zaved Akhtar, president of the Foreign Investors’ Chamber of Commerce and Industries, highlighted the importance of credibility, continuity, and capacity in attracting foreign investment. He said, ‘Considering the current situation regarding LDC transition, we must take decisions based on our capabilities.’ Selim RF Hussain, president of the Association of Bankers, Bangladesh urged the government to improve law and order and adopt measures beyond contractionary monetary policy to control inflation. ‘We need to bring discipline in the banking sector. At the same time, we need to root out crony capitalism from our country,’ he said. Selim RF Hussain called for the overhaul of the existing legal system. Incepta Pharmaceuticals chairman Abdul Muktadir asked to expedite the election of the trade bodies, saying that the elected trade bodies will be able to coordinate with the government properly. ‘There should be a roadmap with a specific time frame for improving the law and order situation,’ he added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/trade-commerce/251684/business-leaders-urge-action-
HC to deliver verdict today,"The High Court is set to announce today its verdict on the death reference of 19 convicts and appeals of 19 others sentenced to life imprisonment in the August 21, 2004, grenade attack case. The attack targeted an Awami League rally on Bangabandhu Avenue in Dhaka in which 24 people were killed and scores of others injured, narrowly missed then opposition leader Sheikh Hasina, though she sustained hearing damage. Two cases — one for murder and another under the Explosive Substances Act — were filed on August 22, 2004. A bench of Justice AKM Asaduzzaman and Justice Syed Enayet Hossain completed the hearing on November 21 and said that the verdict would be delivered any day. On the final day of the five-day proceedings, senior defence lawyer SM Shajahan sought the acquittal of the 19 death-row convicts,  including former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar, former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu, and a former National Security Intelligence director general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury. Shajahan also argued for the acquittal of 19 other convicts, including acting BNP chairman Tarique Rahman, who was tried in his absence. He contended that the second charge sheet, submitted in July 2011 under the Awami League government, lacked legal validity. This supplementary charge sheet implicated 30 new individuals, including Tarique Rahman, Babar, and Jamaat leader Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mujahid. Mujahid was executed for 1971 war crimes, on November 21, 2015, before the trial court delivered verdict in the case in 2018. Shajahan questioned the legitimacy of a second confessional statement attributed to Mufti Abdul Hannan, the executed leader of Harkat-ul-Jihad, arguing that multiple confessions in the same case are legally inadmissible. Hannan was initially named in the 2008 charge sheet and was executed in 2017 for a separate grenade attack on former British envoy Anwar Choudhury. Deputy attorney general Md Jashim Sarker, however, strongly defended the trial court verdict, arguing for its full endorsement. In the five-day hearing, Jashim presented key findings of the case to underscore the gravity of the attack and the strength of the evidence. The death reference and appeals had initially been heard by the High Court bench of Justice Shahidul Karim and Justice Md Akhtaruzzaman. That bench reviewed depositions of 235 witnesses in 18 months and adjourned the hearing on August 18, 2024, citing the need for the state law officers’ preparation. The chief justice later reassigned the case to the bench of Justice AKM Asaduzzaman and Justice Syed Enayet Hossain, where the fresh hearing began on October 31. On October 10, 2018, the Dhaka Speedy Trial Tribunal 1 sentenced 19 individuals to death, 19 people, including Tarique, to imprisonment for life term and 11 others to imprisonment for varying terms. Tarique, the eldest son of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, was tried in his absence, as he has been residing in London since 2008. The twelve fugitive convicts, including Tarique, did not appeal against the trial court verdict. Former inspectors general of police Ashraful Huda, Shahudul Haque, and Khoda Baksh Chowdhury, former assistant superintendents of the Criminal Investigation Department Munshi Atiqur Rahman and Abdur Rashid, and CID special superintendent Ruhul Amin were among 11 police officers convicted in the cases on the charge of diverting the course of the investigation. The convicted police officers are now on bail. Major death penalty recipients are former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar and former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu, his brother Maulana Tajuddin (fugitive), intelligence officials former major general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury and former brigadier general Abdur Rahim, who died later. The rest of the condemned convicts are extremist suspects maulana Sheikh Abdus Salam, Yusuf Butt alias Majid Butt, Abdul Malek alias Golam Mohammad, Maulana Shawkat Osman, Mohibullah alias Mofizur Rahman alias Ovi, Maulana Abu Sayeed alias Dr Abu Zafar, Abul Kalam Azad alias Bulbul, Jahangir Alam, Maulana Abu Taher, and Hossain Ahammed Tamim, Mufti Moinuddin Sheikh alias Abu Zandal alias Masum Billah, Rafikul Islam alias Rashed alias Sabuj and Mohammad Ujjal alias Ratan, and transport owner Md Hanif. Of the convicts, Tajuddin and Hanif were fugitives. Besides Tarique Rahman, the political figures who were sentenced to life imprisonment are former prime minister Khaleda Zia’s then political adviser Haris Chowdhury, who died later, and former BNP lawmaker Qazi Shah Mofazzal Hossain Kaikobad. Jahangir Alam Alias Badar, Mohammad Iqbal, Mohibul Muttakin, Ratul Ahmed Basu, Mufti Shafikur Rahman, Maulana Liton Alias Zobir alias Delwar, Mufti Abdul Hai, Anisul Mursalin, Md Khalilur Rahman, Maulana Abu Bakar alias Selim Howlader sentenced to life imprisonment remain fugitives. Of the 19 life term recipients Maulana Abdur Rouf, Ariful Islam Arif, Shahadatullah Jewel, Maulana Sabbir Ahmed alias Abdul Hannan Sabbir, Asif Hasan alias Sujan alias Abdul Razzak, and Maulana Yahya are in custody. In 2005, Joj Mia, a petty poster and cassette seller from Gulistan, became an unlikely suspect in grenade attack. Having returned his village home at Senbagh in Noakhali, after falling ill, Joj Mia was abruptly arrested by police on June 10, 2005. He was reportedly tortured into providing a false confession implicating himself in the deadly attack. The arrest and coerced confession became emblematic of the manipulation surrounding the case during the BNP-led Four Party Alliance government’s tenure. The investigation, hastily concluded by the ruling alliance, claimed the attack was orchestrated by Awami League members, a narrative that diverted attention from the actual perpetrators. Under the military-backed caretaker government in 2007, the case was reopened, and the CID re-investigated the incident. Joj Mia was subsequently dropped from the case, and in June 2008, the CID pressed charges against 22 individuals, including former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu and Mufti Abdul Hannan. After the Awami League assumed power in December 2008, the investigation was expanded further, leading to two charge sheets implicating 49 individuals. The trial began shortly thereafter, uncovering the extent of the initial cover-up.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251683/hc-to-deliver-verdict-today
"No motorcycles, trailers on Ctg expressway","The Chattogram Development Authority is going to ban the movement of motorcycles and trailers on the elevated expressway between Lalkhan Bazar and Shah Amanat International Airport from today to reduce the risk of traffic accident. From today, other vehicles including the CNG-run auto-rickshaws will be allowed to run on the  expressway, officially known as the CDA Expressway. The authorities are planning to officially open the 16.5-kilometre long expressway within this month (December) after around eight years the initiative was taken to reduce traffic congestion in the port city. In the meantime, the project saw a third time extension in the deadline and increase in cost for once because of inclusion of new components and changes to its alignment and design. When the expressway will be officially inaugurated, the vehicle owners will have to pay toll, said officials of the Chattogram Development Authority, the implementing agency of the expressway under the housing and public works ministry. On the Dhaka Elevated Expressway, smaller vehicles like motorcycles and CNG-run auto-rickshaws are not allowed to run to reduce the risk of accidents. After the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government on August 5 this year following a student-led mass uprising, the expressway in the port city was opened to all kinds of vehicles the same month on trial basis and without toll. ‘The motorcycles are running on the expressway defying the notice we installed at the entrances banning these vehicles on this road,’ said the project director and the CDA executive engineer Md Mahfuzur Rahman. He said that they had decided to stop the movement of motorcycles on the expressway from today (Sunday) to reduce the risks of accidents. The movement of the heavy vehicles – called as trailers – would be banned on the expressway also, he continued. The project office, he further said, had already contacted the traffic police to stop motorcycles and trailers to use the expressway from Sunday. ‘We allowed the CNG-run auto-rickshaws to run on the expressway following the demand of the public as a huge number of these vehicles run in this city,’ Mahfuzur said. He said that the overall progress of the project to construct the expressway till now is around 90 per cent. According to the project office, the project was approved in July 2017 with an aim to be concluded by 2020. ‘The construction works under the project started in 2019 which halted during the Covid-19 pandemic,’ the project director said, adding, ‘we actually worked since 2021.’ The first extension in the project deadline was till June 2022, the second was till June 2024 and the latest is till June 2025, he added. The project cost saw an escalation by Tk 1,048.12 crore to Tk 4,298.95 crore from Tk 3,250.83 crore. The expressway is scheduled to put direct connection among the Chittagong Port, south Chattogram and the port city’s industrial areas including – Faujdarhat, Nasirabad and Kalurghat areas. ‘We are planning to officially inaugurate the expressway and collect toll from the vehicles within one or two weeks,’ Mahfuzur said and added that they had already fixed the rates of the toll based on vehicle classes and as per the Roads and Highways Department rates for toll.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251682/no-motorcycles-trailers-on-ctg-expressway

BNS Bishkhali added to navy fleet,"BNS Bishkhali was commissioned into service with the Bangladesh Navy at a ceremony at the BNS Titumir, a naval base in Khulna. The chief of naval staff admiral M Nazmul Hasan was present at the ceremony as chief guest on Saturday. Addressing the ceremony, the navy chief expressed the hope to build the Bangladesh Navy into a modern, strong, and capable force. ‘It is necessary to build the Bangladesh Navy as a strong force to protect the country’s independence and sovereignty, economic development, and geopolitical necessity,’ he said. As part of continuous capacity building, the Navy had become a skilled tri-dimensional force, he said, adding that the BNS Bishkhali was a milestone as the ship was built by their own technology. Like other warship, the BNS Biskhali would play a pioneering role in preventing smuggling, illegal fisheries extraction, and intrusion of illegal goods, including drugs and to ensure the security of commercial ships from pirates and conduct operational drives at the coastal belt. ‘The Bangladesh Navy is always dedicated to getting security measures at sea ports aimed at achieving economic solvency, smooth management of sea trading, implementing the blue economy and facing any natural disasters,’ the Navy chief said. He, however, said that the Bangladesh Navy had generated huge employment in building ships, including warships, at its own shipyard side by side savings huge foreign currency. Besides, the Bangladesh Navy was capable of upgrading inventors from ship purchasers. Later, the chief guest handed over the commissioning decree to the captain of the ship and unveiled the name plaque formally. PSO of navy headquarters, high naval and government officials, freedom fighters, elite, among others, were present on the occasion.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251677/bns-bishkhali-added-to-navy-fleet
Australia reiterates commitment to advancing gender equality,"Acting Australian high commissioner to Bangladesh Nardia Simpson said that Australia was committed to advancing gender equality and combating gender-based violence in all its forms.

Asif Nazrul urges unity to uphold uprising spirit,"Law, justice and parliamentary affairs adviser Asif Nazrul on Saturday called upon all the stakeholders of the mass uprising to maintain unity to sustain its achievements and materialise the aspirations of the martyrs. ‘A number of revolutions in global history, including Arab Spring in Tunisia and Syria, failed to materialise the aspirations of the movement in the long run.  We must materialise the dreams of July uprising martyrs by building an independent and sovereign Bangladesh in true sense,’ he said. He was addressing a memorial meeting on July uprising titled ‘Smritir Minar: Gono Abhyuthan-2024’, organised by Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha at Jatiya press Club, with BSS managing director and chief editor Mahbub Morshed in chair. Chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam, writer Rakhal Raha, poet and activist Ferdous Ara Rumi, members of BSS board of directors Fazlul Huq and Nure Alam Masud, and Gono Odhikar Parishad general secretary Muhammad Rashed Khan also addressed the discussion, conducted by BSS special correspondent Didarul Alam. ‘The interim government has been making all out efforts to build an independent and sovereign and dignified Bangladesh in true sense to materialise the dream of the martyrs,’ Asif Nazrul said. He called everyone to search the truth and refrain from character assassination of each other saying, ‘Spreading misinformation, propaganda, blaming others, oppression or torture were the weapons of fascist force… Our weapons are truth, unity and getting rid of repression and discrimination.’ Regarding an allegation against him about holding meetings with Indian allies in Dhaka cantonment on August 3 and 4 before the ouster of Awami League regime, Asif Nazrul said that it was completely a fabricated allegation. ‘On August 3, after attending the student movement’s rally at Shaheed Minar, I was there till 9:00pm with Mahbub Morshed and others. Later, I stayed the night at professor Mustafa Mamun’s house in fuller road area of Dhaka University after being informed that I might be arrested or killed,’ the adviser clarified. ‘In the night of August 4, I attended a programme with online activists after the evening.

Energy indemnity law repealed,"The government has promulgated an ordinance repealing the controversial energy law called ‘Quick enhancement of electricity and energy supply act, 2010’. A gazette notification was issued on Saturday regarding the promulgation of the ordinance passed on November 28. The repeal ordinance was to be immediately effective. The gazette stated that actions taken under the 2010 law would be considered legally done while activities undergoing by the power of the law would continue and be completed as if it had not been repealed. However, the gazette noted that the government for public interest can evaluate any activities taken under the law and take any step necessary regarding the activities. Hours before the gazette was made available, power, energy and mineral resources adviser Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan had said that they had awaited the full verdict of the High Court declaring some sections of the law unconstitutional to pass the ordinance. Fouzul was speaking at a discussion on transition to renewable energy at the Economic Reporters’ Forum on Saturday morning. Some of the speakers at the discussion urged the government to reconsider for the sake of foreign investment before cancelling some of the renewable energy projects that signed letter of intent. ‘There is no scope of considering the matter when the law does not exist anymore,’ said the energy adviser, iterating his government’s commitment to ensure competitive bidding in all businesses. ‘Business will no longer be reserved for ministers’ relatives or those who can hand secretaries large sums.  Every citizen has right to doing business,’ he said. A small change in the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation law regarding business tenders had opened the import of fuel to a larger number of businesses, he said, adding that it had ensured an import deal that cost 35 per cent less than deals done under the past government. In the past 14 years until Hasina was overthrown on August 5, the Awami League government made almost all power and energy deals behind the scene under the protection of the law. The law had handed unprecedented power to the minister of power and energy, which was Hasina herself, enabling her to award power and energy deals without any tender while ensuring that her decisions could not be challenged in any court of law. The ‘Quick enhancement of electricity and energy supply act, 2010’, enacted on October 12 in 2010, had come to be known as the indemnity law. Its initial tenure was for two years, later to be extended four times—in 2012, the law was given two years’ extension, followed by four year’s extension awarded in 2014, three years extension in 2018, and five years extension in 2021 until 2026. Ignoring widespread demands from energy and legal experts for throwing it out, the government, wielding the law, oversaw unabated fossil fuel expansion at exorbitant prices further facilitating corruption and inefficiency. It created the scope for channeling a huge amount of public money into private pockets by establishing a power system suffering from 50 per cent overcapacity. The law allows awarding any companies without tender any power and energy projects, including the import of natural gas, coal, liquefied natural gas and petroleum products, as well as the extraction of mineral resources. The law also covers electricity generation, transmission and distribution projects. In Section 9, the law states that the legality of any activity or measure or order taken or given under it cannot be challenged in any court of law. No legal action can be taken against any employees and officials who have operated under the law or its subordinate rules or any general or special orders given under it, states Section 10 of the law, considering all actions done under it performed in good faith. After taking permission from the minister, Subsection 2 of Section 6 states that a special committee can contact and negotiate with a limited number of parties or a single party to process any procurement or investment proposals in the power and energy sector. The special committee used to comprise, as usually, top officials of the energy ministry and the state-owned power end energy entities. Under the law, the government indiscriminately approved projects, increasing the installed power generation capacity to over 28,000MW in June this year from less than 5,000MW in 2009. On November 14, the High Court invalidated two sections of the law.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251674/energy-indemnity-law-repealed
Merchant power policy on cards,"The government is formulating a merchant power policy to unburden its power and energy sector liabilities. The merchant power policy is expected to end the era in which the government has been the sole buyer of all electricity produced currently in the country—over half of it by private power producers, also known as independent power producers, IPP in short, while the rest is generated by state-owned power plants. Currently, the government is also responsible for managing fuels, mostly through imports, for most of the independent power producers, while recognising their entitlement to capacity payment that refers to the obligatory condition under which IPPs are paid anyway regardless of electricity generation. Fossil fuel imports, particularly the import of liquefied natural gas, and capacity payment, mostly made in dollars, are considered by economists and energy experts among the key reasons behind Bangladesh’s depleting forex reserves. Bangladesh is grappling with the worst economic crisis in decades with nearly double digit inflation, triggered to a great extent by excessive energy expenses, plaguing the country for over two years. ‘The IPPs have destroyed the power sector,’ said power, energy and mineral resources adviser Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan. ‘Governments buying electricity is no longer in fashion,’ he said, explaining that the new policy being formulated would allow independent power producers to generate and sell electricity on their own. The independent power producers could use the national grid for a fee, he said, adding that the power tariff would be settled based on negotiations between power producers and their customers. The government, however, could retain 20 per cent power generation capacity, leaving the task of meeting the rest of the power demand with IPPs. The adviser made the statement while speaking as chief guest at a discussion on transition to renewable energy at the Economic Reporters’ Forum auditorium in Dhaka on Saturday. The government’s role as the sole buyer created a huge burden as it struggled to pay power producers with installed electricity generation capacity worth thousands of megawatts remaining unused due to energy crisis. The Bangladesh Power Development Board owed Tk 44,338 crore to power producers at the end of the last fiscal of 2023–24, as the national power company could clear only half of its dues to power producing companies. Last fiscal, the power development board cleared 49.7 per cent of its total dues. It paid more than Tk 43,882 crore to 115 power producers, revealed the official data, with 78 per cent of the payment—Tk 34,410 crore—going to 24 IPPs. Bangladesh’s current subsidy requirement in the power and energy sector is over Tk 50,000 crore, including Tk 34,000 crore subsidy, required for power sector alone. Fouzul Kabir Khan said that land scarcity barring renewable energy expansion was a myth as unused government land and rooftops offered huge potentials for electricity generation using solar energy. ‘The earlier we all realise that there is no alternative to renewable energy expansion to ensure energy security the better,’ said Fouzul. He said that the past Awami League government’s lack of commitment prevented renewable energy expansion. Hasan Mehedi, member secretary, Bangladesh Working Group on Ecology and Development, one of the organisers of the discussion said that in the last decade Tk 2.87 lakh crore was invested in fossil fuel against only Tk 4,500 crore spent in renewable energy sector. Centre for Policy Dialogue research director Khondaker Golam Moazzem urged authorities for adopting financing instruments to facilitate transferring of foreign direct investments and investment from multilateral development banks into the renewable energy sector. He also urged steps from the banks to extend loan payback period to 10–12 years from existing six years, which was too short a period for renewable energy investors. Findings of a study released in the discussion revealed that Bangladesh currently required a staggering Tk 87,000 crore in investment in the next six years to achieve its renewable energy goal. The current trend, however, is unpromising as a little more than Tk 2,000 crore had been invested in the last six years, said Gouranga Nandy, chairman, Centre for Environment and Participatory Research, while presenting the study findings. City Bank country business manager Ahsanur Rahman said that renewable energy investment was still not considered profitable by companies despite banks committed effort to direct financing in that direction. Banks barely escaped the risk of losing their capital by lending to investors of fossil fuel-based projects who went on the verge of defaulting on loan payment as the government struggled to pay their dues. ‘Bonds released by the government eventually saved the day but the fact remains that banks could not profit from their investments in the power sector,’ he said. The other two co-organisers of the discussion were the Economic Reporters Forum and Coastal Livelihood and Environmental Action Network.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/power-energy/251672/merchant-power-policy-on-cards
Trump II and the Middle East,"IT IS too early to draw an outline of the Middle East policy of the incoming Trump administration. The cabinet and other senior positions are shaping up, while Democrats are doing their best to badger Arab-Americans for their vote against the Democratic Party. We can draw on a variety of factors to understand the general direction of Donald Trump’s Mideast policies. Will Jared Kushner play a role in the new administration? Trump viewed his son-in-law as an in-house Middle East expert not because of his academic credentials or his experience in the region, but purely because of his fanatical attachment to the Likud agenda. Even if Kushner does not have a formal role in the White House he could, by virtue of his proximity to the president, override decisions by the State Department or other agencies if he deemed them unfavourable to Israeli interests. But that probably wouldn’t be necessary as Trump is appointing people beholden to AIPAC’s agenda and who in some cases are even more extreme than AIPAC. Some of them are much closer to the West Bank criminal settler movement. Kushner is likely to play a role because his Abraham Accords are considered by some Democrats (such as New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman) as a great achievement and an example of success by the Trump administration. In fact, political and military developments in the Middle East since October 7 all refute the premise of the Abraham Accords that basically dismissed the political salience of the Palestinian question. The Kushner plan was predicated on the notion that the Palestinian cause will go away if we ignore it and if we secure peace treaties between Israel and Arab despots. The two most influential Middle East leaders (the despot of Saudi Arabia and the despot of the United Arab Emirates) are very close to Kushner and the two countries, along with Qatar, have contributed generously to his business ventures solely because of his proximity to his father-in-law. Since Trump’s management of policy is eccentric at best (or informal and unprofessional) it is not unreasonable to consider the possibility of a political role for Massad Boulos, the father of Trump’s other son-in-law, Michael Boulos. Massad has been talking with the president-elect on Middle East policy matters and Trump appointed him as his point man for outreach with the Arab and Muslim American community during the election. His efforts bore fruit as many Arab Americans in Michigan were persuaded by Boulos that Trump is serious about ending the on-going wars in the Middle East. There’s even a Middle East restaurant owner of Lebanese origin in Dearborn who swore that the president-elect pledged to end the Israeli war on Lebanon. If Boulos were to play a role on Middle East policy it is likely that he will clash with Kushner over different visions of the Middle East and the U.S. role. Which in-law will Trump favour? In the 2024 election campaign, Boulos seemed to have had a bigger role than Kushner.  Arab hopes and second-term presidents IN THE Middle East in particular there’s always been illusory hopes that in a second term an American president will be kinder to the Arabs because they are free of the AIPAC yoke. Some Arabs still believe that the Mossad killed President John F. Kennedy (although there is no evidence of that whatsoever) in order to prevent him from restoring justice to the Palestinians. Arabs also believed that Richard Nixon, the staunch Zionist who gave Israel all it wanted and more in the 1973 war, was planning to help Arabs in his second term and that Watergate was a Mossad conspiracy to foil his Middle East plans. The same hopes were pinned on Ronald Reagan, whose second term was as bad as the first when it came to the Middle East. Bill Clinton in his second term actually betrayed the Palestinians more than he did in his first, especially in the infamous Camp David meeting toward the end of his second term, when he lied to the Palestinian people, pledging that he would not fault the Palestinian Authority’s Yasser Arafat if the talks failed. He then rushed to blame Arafat when they did. To be sure, Trump is not a regular politician and doesn’t operate according to the norms. But the same constraints are placed on him, if not more than usual.  Talk of a deep state TRUMP and his advisors talk of the Deep State in reference to the permanent national security state regardless of change in the White House. Former president Barack Obama and Trump both tried to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan and President Joe Biden finally achieved that goal with a lot of controversy and objections by the press, which is largely a guardian of the national security state. Trump will also likely operate from grudges he’s held since his first term. How will Trump balance the debt he owes Miriam Adelson and his resentment against Benjamin Netanyahu who rushed to congratulate Joe Biden when Trump was still contesting the results of the 2020 election? Trump has publicly criticised Netanyahu, and he seems resentful that not only Israelis, but also American Jews have not appreciated him enough for all he did for Israel in his first term. He spoke glowingly about Mahmoud Abbas and about his desire for peace — a jab at the Israeli government.  Trump’s aims for the region HERE is what Trump likely wants to accomplish in the Middle East in his second term: The profit motive will remain primary in his second term as it was in his first. He wants oil and gas puppets in the Middle East to spend lavishly on US arms and other goods. Those despotic puppets won’t disappoint and don’t demand an exorbitant political payment from the White House outside of military support and looking the other way on democracy and human rights. The Saudi government may, however, out of self-interest, demand increased security guarantees from the US in return for normalisation with Israel. As Trump won praise for the Abraham Accords, he may invest in their perpetuation and expansion to new members, especially Saudi Arabia, but also others including Lebanon. Obviously Lebanon is the least likely candidate given the solid military opposition to peace with Israel within a large segment of the population. Liberals and conservatives alike are still convinced even after a year of Israeli genocide, that peace with Arab despots is sufficient to provide stability for the region (which translates as stability for U.S. interests in the region). But Trump will face a hurdle in attempting to bring Saudi Arabia into the Abraham Accords; the Saudi public remains staunchly supportive of Palestinian political rights. And the horrific scenes spread throughout Middle East media of Israeli slaughter of Palestinians, Lebanese, Yemenis and Iraqis have only deepened Arab public detestation of Zionism and its crimes. But Saudi Arabia is willing — for a price — to lower its political requirements for peace with Israel; and recently the Saudi foreign minister indicated that the government no longer demands the establishment of a Palestinian state as a precondition for peace with Israel but merely a declaration of a pathway to a Palestinian state, i.e. a verbal declaration of sorts to assuage the Saudi public. he appointment of several staunch Zionists to the new administration could lead to an increase in political concessions from Trump to Israel, adding to those he served them during his first term. U.S. recognition of West Bank annexation appears plausible, though it’s debated within Israel because it would expose the state’s blatant apartheid. The regional and international backlash this would provoke could also disrupt expansion of the Abraham Accords. It is less likely that Trump will initiate a war in the Middle East as his appetite for war appears far less than that of the Biden-Harris administration. This does not mean, however. that Trump will not support and arm any existing or new Israeli war against Arabs or Iran. Trump may engage in negotiations with Iran to reach an agreement on its nuclear program. The meeting between Elon Musk and Iranian diplomats in New York (if it happened as Iran has denied it) likely had Trump’s approval. In contrast, Biden wasted four years without pursuing dialogue with Iran, despite the Democratic Party’s backing of the 2015 nuclear agreement. Trump appears less constrained by Washington’s political establishment than Biden, who has consistently aligned with the war-focused Washington agenda. This highlights Trump’s willingness to explore unorthodox diplomatic paths. We don’t really know what to expect from Trump in his second term. Will he feel emboldened by his decisive victory to distance himself from the agenda of war and aggression of the Deep State or will he continue on the predictable path of hostility to Iran and unconditional support for Israeli aggression? Trump will inherit dangerous regional conflicts from the Biden administration. Biden has taken the world closer to nuclear war than any previous time since the Cuban Missile Crisis. There will be political rewards for Trump if he were to achieve peace between Russia and Ukraine and to end Israel’s wars in the Middle East. But peace is still a dirty word in both the Democratic and Republican parties’ lexicon.  Consortiumnews.com, November 30.

Ending violence against women,"VIOLENCE against women and girls has been found to be the deadliest, most prevalent, and most pervasive human rights violation in every community across the world, be it rich or poor, literate or illiterate, developed or undeveloped, resulting in the sad demise of a woman every 10 minutes globally. Such omnipresence of violence poses operational challenges for designing protocols and interventions to end violence against women and girls. Globally, almost one in every three women has been subjected to physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner, non-partner sexual violence, or both at least once in their lifetime, where 30 per cent of women are aged 15 and older. It is frustrating that most incidents are committed by current or former husbands or intimate partners, where more than 26 per cent are subjected to intimate partner violence. The World Health Organisation policy survey 2023 evidenced that overall, 81 per cent of countries have a multisectoral violence against women policy; just over half (52 per cent) have health sector violence against women protocols. In Bangladesh there are a number of laws and policies with institutional arrangements to safeguard the rights of women and girls, including the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act 2010.  The one-stop crisis centres established at the medical college hospitals have been designed to provide comprehensive support to women and children victims of violence, offering healthcare, police assistance, legal aid, and other services, but the recent report evidenced that the conviction rate in related cases is less than 2 per cent. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics revealed a high rate of intimate partner violence, with 1 in 2 women aged 15 or over who have ever been married reporting that they have endured physical and sexual violence during their lives. Recently, BBS has also reported an alarming upswing in child marriage, despite the government’s strong commitment to end marriage of children under 15 by 2021. Gender disparity remains one of the dominant concerns of women in every cluster of society across Bangladesh. The unequal arrangement for women in Bangladesh maintained by the constitution reflects gender-based discrimination in mainstream society. At the domestic level, during marriages and separations, for example, women’s right to choice is governed by the personal laws that give more importance to social obligation than personal choice. Unfortunately, women remain unsafe at home, where they are supposed to be the safest. Eminent scholar Dr Hossain Zillur Rahman remarked, ‘The Bangladeshi women are enjoying the freedom of mobility and visibility’ as cheap labour in the apparel sector, but they are deprived of their rightful wages. In such a reality, marking the 16 Days of Activism 2024, human rights activists from home and abroad are advocating for securing the rights of women and girls. The 16 Days of Activism is a campaign to challenge the violence against women and girls that more than 130 countries have actively joined. This year the campaign is designed considering the fact that the world approaches the 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in 2025. People in general and the rights activists in particular from across the globe unite to raise awareness about eliminating gender-based violence, challenge discriminatory attitudes, behaviours, and actions, and thus call for better policy response with effective service delivery mechanisms to end violence against women and girls for their betterment. The 16 Days Campaign has been instrumental in organising strategies by individuals and groups around the world to call for the elimination of all forms of violence against women, where approximately 1,700 organisations around the globe have participated since 1991. Every year, 16 Days of Activism against gender-based violence begins on November 25. This day was chosen to commemorate the death of the three Mirabel sisters, who were detained, tortured, and assassinated in 1960 during the dictatorship of Trujillo (1930-1961) in the Dominican Republic. The period also includes: November 29, International Women’s Human Rights Defenders Day; December 1, World AIDS Day; December 3, International Day of the Disabled; December 6, Montreal Massacre Anniversary; and, December 10, World Human Rights Day. This year, the UNiTE digital campaign for the 16 Days of Activism has been designed to uphold the urgency for action and accountability to end violence against women and girls, with a special focus on gender-related killing of women across communities worldwide. As gender-related killings continue to rise globally, this digital campaign highlights the urgent need to address the continuum of violence and proven solutions. This global digital campaign calls for action at all levels to prevent violence, to hold perpetrators accountable, and to invest in solutions to protect women and girls everywhere. In observance of the 16 days of Activism, the global activists called upon the member states: to accelerate action to ratify and implement international and regional conventions and implement laws and whole-of-government National Action Plans to prevent and respond to VaWG, with adequate resources; to adopt and implement corporate policies on VaWG by the private sector; to strengthen law enforcement and justice sectors, including through gender-responsive policing to hold the perpetrators to account; to ensure women’s and marginalised groups’ meaningful access to gender-responsive justice where they can seek remedies without fear of negative consequences; to raise awareness that VaWG is never acceptable, create zero tolerance across society at large and prevent violence through transforming harmful social norms; and, to enhance women’s rights movements’ access to flexible, sustainable, and quality funding to fulfill their missions. Bangladesh has been in the era of bringing reform to the national laws and policies following the changes in the country’s political landscape. The interim government has already initiated several reform agendas, formulating numerous reform commissions. It is imperative to form an independent Women’s Commission with a special assignment to examine the laws and policies protecting the rights of women and enabling institutional capacity to deal with the cases of violence against women and to pursue speedy trials towards landmark judgments for women through effective reform in the justice sector. It is time for Bangladesh to move beyond misconceptions and embrace a more inclusive approach that recognises the inherent value of every individual, regardless of their gender differences, bringing necessary changes in the health sector, ensuring effective implementation of the existing policies, and creating an enabling environment to uphold the rights of women in general.

Reimagining reform: civic engagement,"THE July uprising of 2024 marked a pivotal turning point in our nation’s history, a moment when people collectively voiced their frustrations against systemic inequalities, unresponsive governance, and widespread corruption. The events of that revolutionary monsoon were not just an eruption of anger but a call for meaningful change and societal reform. At its core, the uprising highlighted the power of civic engagement — individuals and communities coming together to demand accountability, propose solutions, and reshape the social contract. Now, as the dust settles, the real work begins — reimagining reform by channelling the energy of civic engagement into sustainable, transformative change. Civic engagement is the cornerstone of a functioning democracy. It encompasses actions that enable citizens to contribute to the betterment of their communities, whether through grassroots activism, public dialogue, policy advocacy, or participating in electoral processes. The July uprising was a testament to the power of collective civic action, demonstrating how ordinary people can challenge the status quo and push for systemic reform. But for true transformation, this engagement must evolve from protest to participation, ensuring that citizens remain actively involved in shaping the policies and structures that govern their lives. In the wake of the uprising, people’s expectations for reform are clear: they demand transparency, justice, and inclusivity. The movement has underscored the need for governance that reflects the will of the people and prioritises their needs over entrenched interests. This involves addressing the following critical areas: Trust in institutions: Public trust in governmental and social institutions has eroded over the years due to corruption, inefficiency, and a lack of accountability. Civic engagement can play a key role in rebuilding this trust. Citizen-led watchdog groups, participatory budgeting, and open data initiatives can ensure that institutions operate transparently and responsibly. Social equity and inclusion: The July uprising shone a spotlight on the marginalisation of vulnerable groups. Reform must prioritise inclusivity, addressing disparities in education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. Civic movements can amplify the voices of under-represented communities, advocating for policies that promote social equity. Youth and education as catalysts for change: The energy and determination of the youth were instrumental in the uprising. Harnessing this momentum requires reforms in the education system to promote civic literacy, critical thinking, and leadership skills. Schools and universities must become spaces for dialogue and innovation, empowering the next generation to actively engage in societal reform. Economic justice and opportunity: Economic disparities were a major driver of the uprising. Reform must address the structural inequalities that perpetuate poverty and unemployment. Civic engagement can play a role here by fostering community-based economic initiatives, supporting local businesses, and advocating for fair labour practices. Environmental stewardship and sustainability: No vision for reform is complete without addressing the pressing need for environmental sustainability. Civic movements can push for policies that prioritise renewable energy, sustainable development, and the preservation of natural resources for future generations. The July uprising demonstrated the strength of grassroots movements in mobilising communities and driving change. These movements operate outside traditional power structures, giving voice to those who are often overlooked by mainstream politics. Moving forward, grassroots organisations must continue to play a central role in the reform process, fostering local solutions to national problems and bridging the gap between citizens and policymakers. Grassroots efforts can also inspire innovation in governance. Participatory democracy models, such as citizen assemblies or town hall meetings, can ensure that diverse perspectives are included in decision-making processes. By creating platforms for dialogue and collaboration, these initiatives can help build a more inclusive and responsive society. Technology offers new opportunities for civic engagement and reform. Digital platforms can facilitate communication, organise movements, and hold leaders accountable. In the aftermath of the uprising, technology must be leveraged to ensure that the momentum for change is not lost. Online petitions, social media campaigns, and civic tech tools like open data portals can enable citizens to monitor progress, share ideas, and collaborate on solutions. However, the use of technology must be accompanied by measures to address digital divides and misinformation. Ensuring access to technology for all citizens, particularly in rural and underserved areas, is critical to fostering inclusive civic participation. While the energy of the uprising is vital, sustainable reform requires translating civic action into policy change. This involves fostering a culture of accountability and collaboration between citizens, civil society, and government institutions. Mechanisms such as public consultations, citizen advisory councils, and participatory policy development can institutionalise the principles of civic engagement, ensuring that reform is not just a response to crisis but an ongoing process. Reimagining reform through civic engagement is not without its challenges. Resistance from entrenched power structures, the risk of co-optation by political agendas, and the fatigue of sustained activism can hinder progress. Overcoming these obstacles requires persistence, solidarity, and a commitment to shared values. Leadership is also crucial. Reform efforts need champions — individuals and organisations that can inspire trust, bridge divides, and guide the process of change. These leaders must embody the principles of civic engagement, prioritising collaboration and inclusivity over personal gain. The July uprising was a wake-up call, a reminder that the power to shape a nation lies in the hands of its people. As we move forward, civic engagement must remain at the heart of the reform process. By fostering a culture of participation, inclusivity, and accountability, we can reimagine a society that reflects the aspirations and needs of its citizens. Reforming a nation is not a one-time event but a continuous journey. It requires the collective efforts of individuals, communities, and institutions working together towards a shared vision of justice, equity, and progress. The July uprising has given us an opportunity to reimagine what is possible. Let us seize this moment to build a future that honours the sacrifices and hopes of all who have fought for change.

Managing drug-resistant bacteria,"CONSIDERING the growing inefficacies of antibiotics, a set of empirical studies has claimed that we are sliding back to the ‘pre-antibiotic era,’ highlighting the present and future crises borne out of antibiotic resistance. In today’s world, particularly in the global health discourse, antibiotic resistance has turned out to be a focal point of discussion due to its ominous public health concern. This is evident from seven million global deaths annually and a projection of 10 million deaths each year by 2050. Additionally, the World Bank estimated that antibiotic resistance could plunge 24 million people into extreme poverty and cause a $1-$3 trillion gross domestic product loss by 2030. In this context, it is quite conceivable that people’s health outcomes could be severely degraded. To be more specific, the crisis is particularly severe when it comes to a resource-poor country like Bangladesh with a large population density, pluralistic healthcare systems, and a weak drug regulatory regime. A good deal of contemporary studies and reports have already underscored an alarming antibiotic resistance scenario across the country. Some key pieces of evidence from these studies include: a leading antibiotic called ciprofloxacin is ineffective against 90 per cent of the Bangladeshi population; 70 per cent of ICU deaths are attributed to antibiotic resistance; and on average, a child consumes more than 10 antibiotics each year, far exceeding the global standards. Therefore, the rising public health threats demand that the existing policy interventions in addressing antibiotic resistance in Bangladesh be revisited. Since antibiotic resistance is primarily driven by the misuse of antibiotics, ensuring its rational use has been the major policy goal for Bangladesh, as in other countries across the globe. In particular, the WHO has called for adopting the National Action Plan, a multisectoral policy document to fight against antibiotic resistance. Bangladesh adopted the action plan in 2017. In addition, the National Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Strategy of Bangladesh aims to build a comprehensive antimicrobial resistance monitoring system to gather information for guiding policy choices and promoting the rational use of antibiotics. Guidelines for the judicial use of antibiotics and good pharmacy practices are well-codified in the National Drug Policy 2016. The 8th Five-Year Plan has also incorporated the safe use of antibiotics intending to strengthen the health system in Bangladesh. Despite existing policy interventions, the sale and use of antibiotics remain unregulated. Although the national action plan is considered a blueprint to combat antibiotic resistance, its implementation has remained inconsistent, as highlighted by recent studies. The Directorate General of the Drug Administration is the apex national drug regulatory authority mandated to implement drug regulations in Bangladesh. However, according to WHO’s report, it is not stringent in its operations. The governance of drug administration is not without contention, according to a report of Transparency International Bangladesh. This is also evident from a growing number of unlicensed pharmacies or drug stores involved in the over-the-counter sale of antibiotics. Meanwhile, aggressive marketing strategies of antibiotic drugs by pharmaceutical companies are a major factor that influences physicians’ and patients’ antibiotic prescribing and seeking behaviour, respectively. Moreover, in public mind, antibiotics are considered a ‘cure-all’’ medicine, resulting in antibiotics being sold like candy in Bangladesh. Another fact is that the pharmacy density is higher in Bangladesh than in many other countries. Research in other areas has shown effective policy implementation can bring out significant health benefits. For instance, a recent article published in the International Journal of Applied Research in Social Sciences stressed that the implementation of environmental policies can yield public health benefits. The analysis underscored that effective policy implementation requires a strong governance and regulatory framework. Say, stringent regulation in water and air quality improvements leads to lowering pollution-related diseases, ultimately contributing to public health benefits. This study retains critical implications in terms of the effective enforcement of antibiotic policies in Bangladesh while taking into account the matter of governance and regulatory frameworks. Because proper implementation of such policies is linked to the better health outcomes of people. A similar outcome of policy intervention on the management of drug-resistant bacteria can also be expected. The five-year strategic plan of the Directorate General of Drug Administration (2022–2026) intends to strengthen the regulatory systems as well as the capacity of the Directorate General of Drug Administration. Notwithstanding, its regulatory coverage must be widened to the grassroots levels in Bangladesh because approximately 68 per cent of people live in such areas. Studies conducted on rural people revealed that pharmacies or drug stores are the primary health-seeking point, and often they rely on informal healthcare providers. Thus, antibiotic misuse and self-medication are usual. In conclusion, the prevailing health system loopholes and drug regulatory practices cannot be changed overnight. At the same time, the public health challenges associated with antibiotic resistance require collective and rigorous efforts. The implementation of policies relating to the rational and safe use, production, and distribution of antibiotics, therefore, knows no bounds. The proactive role of governance and inclusive regulatory frameworks is critical in facilitating the implementation of such policies, leading to safeguarding public health for today and future generations.

Govt should break market cartels to contain prices,"PEOPLE, especially the poor and the segments of the population with low, fixed and limited income, continue to suffer as prices of goods remain high. Prices of vegetables, onions, potatoes and edible oil remained high in the week ending on November 29. A slight decrease in prices of coarse varieties of rice, broilers and eggs in the week has, however, failed to make any noticeable difference for consumers. Traders, in their business-as-usual response, seek to say that prices of vegetables, onions and potatoes remained high because of supply inadequacy as the production of early harvest came to be harmed because of flooding and rain. They further seek to say that vegetables have started to be freshly available on the market, but the prices still remain high because of insufficient supply. The traders put the increase in prices of edible oil, especially packed soya bean oil, down to a supply shortage. But the supply of non-packed soya bean oil increased in the week. Papaya sold for Tk 40–50 a kilogram, in the lowest, whilst tomato sold for Tk 150–160 a kilogram, in the highest. Green chilli sold for Tk 100–140 a kilogram and the local variety of onions for Tk 130–140 a kilogram. Whilst all the measures that the government says it has taken to arrest the price spiral appear to have largely fallen flat, the price situation hardly afford people of low, fixed and limited income any relief. The implications of high prices of goods could be further troubling. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification that international agencies, including the United Nations, published in early November says that about 23.3 million people of Bangladesh, who account for more than a fourth of the population, experience high levels of food insecurity. A mix of internal and external factors is often blamed for the prices. The factors include flooding, which is a natural phenomenon, disruption in the supply chain, which could be better handled in most cases with a bit of planning, and market syndication, which is seen to have always been present. The government, which was installed on August 8, has also lowered import duty on several food items in the past three months or so to improve supplies to fight against market volatility, but nothing seems to be working. Lowering import duty on food items is not reported to have effectively worked in the past and some experts believe that this, too, would not work now because it is ultimately the traders who benefit from such measures the most, hardly the government and rarely the consumers. The government should, therefore, do all that it can to bring down prices on the market. It should take up a comprehensive approach which should include a sustained, effective market oversight and an effort to ensure uninterrupted supply to the market. But, first of all, it should break the market cartels at any cost.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/251632/govt-should-break-market-cartels-to-contain-prices
Ban on polythene bags alone will hardly work,"IT IS commendable that the government has announced its firm position against the widespread use of one-time plastic products and continued its drive against polythene bags, but the state of plastic pollution suggests that enforcing a polythene ban is not enough. The environment ministry issued a directive in August that listed 17 single-use plastic products as hazardous and asked retailers and others concerned to phase out the products. The ban on the use of polythene in supermarkets was, accordingly, enforced in October and the same directive was made effective for all retail stores and markets on November 3. Since the imposition of the ban, the government has conducted 166 drives in which 349 entities were fined Tk 19,29,900 and 40,000 kilograms of polythene were seized. After years of negligence in implementing the Polythene Bag Control Act 2002, strict action against the use of polythene is a welcome development, especially in view of the environmental and health burden of plastic pollution. However, the fight against plastic pollution requires a multi-pronged approach which needs to include a biodegradable alternative to polythene and a waste management programme to recycle plastic already in use. A photograph that New Age published on November 30 shows that the unabated dumping of plastic products into the Subhadya canal at Jinjira in Dhaka has almost killed the canal. An estimated 250 tonnes of single-use plastic enter the environment every month and about 80 to 85 per cent of the waste, once discarded, ends up in drains, lakes, rivers and the Bay of Bengal. The ban on polythene is, therefore, a key step in preventing plastic pollution, but it does not address the hazardous plastic items that have already entered the environment. Metal and toxic elements released by way of unplanned disposal of plastic items are diffused into the environment which eventually enter the food chain. The government needs to develop a plan to recycle plastic already in use and provide a biodegradable alternative. Decades of marketing of polythene bags and single-use plastic products have changed consumer behaviour and for a change, there is the need for an awareness campaign. In October, the Plastic Foundation, a platform for plastic manufacturers, urged the government to consider a timeframe of a minimum of six months to a year to support the transition to an alternative. The economy in this case is not necessarily limited to the concern expressed by the industry owners that the sudden ban will risk their investment. There is also the informal recycling economy that provides a livelihood for many. For the government to viably stop the use of environmentally hazardous polythene bags and single-use plastic, it should consider developing a long-term plan in consultation with all stakeholders involved in the informal recycling economy. A ban on polythene bags alone, without a recycling and waste management programme and support for stakeholders so that they can transition to producing biodegradable alternatives, will not be sustainable in the fight against plastic pollution.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/251631/ban-on-polythene-bags-alone-will-hardly-work
