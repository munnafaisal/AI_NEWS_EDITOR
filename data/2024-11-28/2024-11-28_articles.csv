SC denies Halmark chair Jesmine’s bail plea,"The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a bail petition of Hallmark chairman Jesmine Islam. The Appellate Division, headed by chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, passed an order denying the bail plea of Jesmine as the court suspended the bail hearing for three months. The commission filed a case against Jesmine for her alleged involvement in misappropriation of Tk 85,87,00,000 from the state owned Janata Bank by opening false letter of credit. The High Court on March 10 in 2019 granted bail to Jesmine but the appellate division on June 16 in the same year rejected the bail following an appeal by the ACC. The Appellate Division also instructed Jesmine to surrender before the high court within four weeks. The High Court on August 30 in 2022 rejected the bail petition of Jesmine. Finally, she filed bail petition with the Supreme Court against the rejection order of the high court.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251488/sc-denies-halmark-chair-jesmines-bail-plea

Air pollution from fires linked to 1.5m deaths a year,"Air pollution caused by fires is linked to more than 1.5 million deaths a year worldwide, the vast majority occurring in developing countries, a major new study said on Thursday. This death toll is expected to rise in the coming years as climate change makes wildfires more frequent and intense, according to the study in The Lancet journal. The international team of researchers looked at existing data on ‘landscape fires’, which include both wildfires that rage through nature and planned fires such as controlled burns on farming land. Around 4,50,000 deaths a year from heart disease were linked to fire-related air pollution between 2000 and 2019, the researchers said. A further 2,20,000 deaths from respiratory disease were attributed to the smoke and particulates spewed into the air by fire. From all causes around the world, a total of 1.53 million annual deaths were associated with air pollution from landscape fires, according to the study. More than 90 per cent of these deaths were in low and middle-income countries, it added, with nearly 40 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa alone. The countries with the highest death tolls were China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Indonesia, and Nigeria. A record amount of illegal burning of farm fields in northern India has been partly blamed for noxious smog that has recently been choking the capital New Delhi. The authors of the Lancet study called for ‘urgent action’ to address the huge death toll from landscape fires. The disparity between rich and poor nations further highlights ‘climate injustice’, in which those who have contributed the least to global warming suffer from it the most, they added. Some of the ways people can avoid smoke from fires — such as moving away from the area, using air purifiers and masks, or staying indoors — are not available to people in poorer countries, the researchers pointed out. So they called for more financial and technological support for people in the hardest-hit countries. The study was released a week after UN climate talks where delegates agreed to a boost in climate funding that developing countries slammed as insufficient. It also came after Ecuador declared a national emergency over forest fires that have razed more than 10,000 hectares in the country’s south. The world has also been battered by hurricanes, droughts, floods and other extreme weather events during what is expected to be the hottest year in recorded history.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/251486/air-pollution-from-fires-linked-to-1.5m-deaths-a-year
Dhaka’s development plan should be based on water flow: seminar,"Kazi Khaleed Ashraf, the director general of Bengal Institute for Architecture, Landscapes, and Settlements, at a seminar on Thursday emphasised that Dhaka’s development plan should prioritise water flow. Highlighting that Bangladesh is home to the world’s largest delta, where lives depend on the river flow, Kazi Khaleed said, ‘If you really want to talk about planning Dhaka, the number one priority should be identifying the water. But that’s not how planning works in Dhaka—water flow ranks the 13th or 14th on the list of priorities.’ He shared these views while delivering the keynote speech titled ‘Architecture is Bigger than Architecture: The Making of Healthy Cities’ at an event held at the ICDDR, B auditorium in the capital’s Mohakhali, marking the international health research organisation’s 64th anniversary. He said, ‘Water flow should be a new theoretical orientation in designing plans,’ but noted that Dhaka’s floodplains, agricultural lands, and wetlands have been gradually encroached upon in the name of development, which he described as ‘a wrong way to go’. He emphasised that buildings should be designed to allow proper ventilation and act as tools for healing, embodying the concept of ecological architecture by harmonising with nature. To create a healthier and more liveable city, he proposed 11 actionable ideas, including regional planning, preserving riverbanks, protecting floodplains, planting and conserving trees, improving housing, and fostering collaborative city-making. In his welcome remarks, Tahmeed Ahmed, executive director of ICDDR, B, highlighted the organisation’s role in the World Health Organisation’s approval of Cecolin, the fourth HPV vaccine for single-dose public use. He described this milestone as a significant step forward in combating cervical cancer, a disease that claims a woman’s life every two minutes, with 90 per cent of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Edwards Cabrera, first secretary for Development-Health of Global Affairs Canada, also spoke on the occasion.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251485/dhakas-development-plan-should-be-based-on-water-flow-seminar

130 killed in Syria clashes,"A Syria war monitor on Thursday said clashes between the army and jihadists killed more than 130 combatants in the worst fighting in the country’s northwest in years, as the government also reported fierce battles. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied factions launched a surprise attack on the Syrian army in the northern province of Aleppo on Wednesday. The toll ‘in battles ongoing for the past 24 hours has risen to 132, including 65 fighters from HTS’, 18 from allied factions ‘and 49 members of regime forces’, said the Observatory, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria. Some of the clashes, in an area straddling Idlib and Aleppo provinces, are less than 10 kilometres (six miles) southwest of the outskirts of Aleppo city. HTS, led by Al-Qaeda’s former Syria branch, controls swathes of much of the northwest Idlib area and slivers of neighbouring Aleppo, Hama and Latakia provinces. An AFP correspondent reported heavy, uninterrupted clashes east of the city of Idlib since Wednesday morning, including air strikes. A military statement carried by state news agency SANA said that ‘armed terrorist organisations grouped under so-called ‘Nusra terrorist front’ present in Aleppo and Idlib provinces launched a large, broad-fronted attack’ on Wednesday morning. It said the attack with ‘medium and heavy weapons targeted safe villages and towns and our military sites in those areas’. The army ‘in cooperation with friendly forces’ confronted the attack ‘which is still continuing’, inflicting ‘heavy losses’ on the armed groups, the military statement said, without reporting army losses.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/251480/130-killed-in-syria-clashes
"One dead, thousands displaced in Thailand floods","Flooding triggered by three days of heavy rain has killed one person and displaced thousands in southern Thailand, with more days of rain forecast, authorities said Thursday. The floods killed one student in Narathiwat province and have displaced more than 2,700 people, Wasan Chaitaweewong, the head of the local department of disaster prevention and mitigation, said. Prolonged rain has also forced the suspension of 65 local schools, he said. A heavy rain warning remains in effect, with continuous rain forecast across 70 per cent of the province until early December, according to the Thai Meteorological Department. More than 500 soldiers and volunteers have been deployed to distribute relief kits and assist in evacuating residents to safer areas. Narathiwat governor Trakul Totham said a team has been set up to accelerate water drainage in affected areas. An employee at a clothing shop said floodwater had ruined her inventory. ‘The water came from the back and it took us off guard,’ she told local media Amarin TV. While Thailand experiences annual monsoon rains, scientists say man-made climate change is causing more intense weather patterns that can make destructive floods more likely. Widespread flooding across Thailand in 2011 killed more than 500 people and damaged millions of homes around the country.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/251479/one-dead-thousands-displaced-in-thailand-floods
Zuckerberg dines with Trump,"Mark Zuckerberg joined Donald Trump for dinner at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Wednesday, with an advisor to the president-elect saying the tech billionaire ‘wants to support the national renewal of America.’ The 40-year-old chief executive of Meta — which owns Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp — has been carefully trying to mend ties with Trump. Both men have had a strained relationship over the years, with Facebook being among social media networks that banned Trump after the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. But on Wednesday, a Meta spokesperson said: ‘Mark was grateful for the invitation to join President Trump for dinner and the opportunity to meet with members of his team about the incoming Administration.’ In a statement, the spokesperson added that it was an important time for the future of American innovation. It was not immediately clear if billionaire Elon Musk, a close Trump ally who previously challenged Zuckerberg to a cage match fight, also attended the dinner, though he has frequently been present at Mar-a-Lago since the election. Stephen Miller, Trump’s incoming deputy chief of staff for policy, told Fox News on Wednesday that Zuckerberg ‘has been very clear about his desire to be a supporter of, and a participant in, this change that we’re seeing all around America.’ ‘He’s made clear that he wants to support the national renewal of America under president Trump’s leadership,’ Miller said in a televised interview. While treading cautiously in Trump’s first term, tech titans were quick to laud the Republican’s election victory this time — with Zuckerberg among those who offered his congratulations. Before the election, Zuckerberg stopped election-related philanthropy and Meta modified its algorithms to reduce political content. Zuckerberg had previously contributed large sums to fund nonprofits working to support US electoral infrastructure during the Covid pandemic. The donations had been seized upon by Trump after his 2020 loss to Joe Biden, falsely alleging that they were part of a plot to swing the election.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/north-america/251478/zuckerberg-dines-with-trump
Lebanon deploys army amid Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire,"Lebanon’s military deployed troops and tanks across the country’s south on Thursday as a ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah war largely held for a second day. The truce ended a war that began a day after Hamas’s unprecedented October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, killing thousands in Lebanon and sparking mass displacements in both Lebanon and Israel. Israel shifted its focus from Gaza to Lebanon in September to secure its northern border from Hezbollah attacks, dealing the Iran-backed Shia Muslim movement a series of staggering blows. Under the terms of the ceasefire, the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers were to become the only armed presence in south Lebanon, where Hezbollah has long held sway. A Lebanese army source said its forces were ‘conducting patrols and setting up checkpoints’ south of the Litani River without advancing into areas where Israeli forces were still present. In the border village of Qlaaya, residents threw rice and flowers to celebrate the arrival of Lebanese soldiers. ‘We only want the Lebanese army,’ chanted the residents of the Christian-majority village, as they clapped and cheered for the troops and waved the Lebanese red, white and green flag. Since the ceasefire took effect on Wednesday, tens of thousands of Lebanese who fled their homes have headed back to their towns and villages, only to find scenes of devastation. ‘Despite all the destruction and the sorrow, we are happy to be back,’ said Umm Mohammed Bzeih, a widow who fled with her four children from the southern village of Zibqin two months ago. ‘I feel as if our souls have returned,’ she said, visibly exhausted as she swept up the shattered glass and pieces of stones that carpeted the floor. While there was joy around Lebanon that the war has ended, it will take the country a long time to recover. Even prior to the conflict, it had been wracked for years by political and economic crisis, with World Bank data from earlier this year indicating poverty had tripled in a decade. On Thursday, there was a glimmer of hope as the official National News Agency reported parliament would meet to elect a president on January 9, following a two-year vacuum. Lebanon is deeply divided along political and sectarian lines, with Hezbollah long dominating the Shia Muslim majority. Hezbollah, the only armed group that refused to surrender its weapons following the 1975-90 civil war, built its popularity by providing health and education services. It has maintained a formidable arsenal, supplied chiefly by Iran, which is widely regarded as more powerful than that of the Lebanese army. While it did not take part in any direct talks for the ceasefire, which was brokered by the United States and France, it was represented by ally parliament speaker Nabih Berri. Hezbollah proclaimed on Wednesday that it had achieved ‘victory’ in the war against Israel, after the truce took effect. ‘Victory from God almighty was the ally of the righteous cause,’ it said, adding its fighters would ‘remain in total readiness to deal with the Israeli enemy’s ambitions and its attacks’. But the war saw Israel deal Hezbollah a string of unprecedented blows, key among them the killing in September of its long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah. Other losses suffered by the group include the death of a string of other top commanders, as well as the killing of the man touted to succeed Nasrallah, Hashem Safieddine. Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah said his group was cooperating on the army’s deployment in the south. There is ‘full cooperation’ with the Lebanese state in strengthening the army’s deployment, he said, adding the group had ‘no visible weapons or bases’ but ‘nobody can make residents leave their villages’. In northern Israel, which has come under steady attack from Hezbollah for more than a year, there was hope tinged with scepticism over whether a truce can last. Nissim Ravivo, a 70-year-old in the coastal city of Nahariya, just 10 kilometres from the border with Lebanon, voiced disappointment. ‘It’s a shame, we should have continued for at least another two months and finished the job,’ he said. ‘We still don’t feel safe and we are not happy about it.’ Lebanon says at least 3,823 people have been killed in the country since October 2023, most of them in recent weeks. On the Israeli side, the hostilities with Hezbollah have killed at least 82 soldiers and 47 civilians, authorities there say. Under the ceasefire deal, Israeli forces will hold their positions but ‘a 60-day period will commence in which the Lebanese military and security forces will begin their deployment towards the south’, a US official told reporters on condition of anonymity. Then Israel will begin a phased withdrawal without a vacuum forming that Hezbollah or others could rush into, the official said. The Israeli and Lebanese militaries have both called on residents of frontline villages to avoid returning home immediately. ‘We control positions in the south of Lebanon, our planes continue to fly in Lebanese airspace,’ Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari said. ‘We control positions in the south of Lebanon, our planes continue to fly in Lebanese airspace.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/251477/lebanon-deploys-army-amid-israel-hezbollah-ceasefire

Liverpool exact revenge on Madrid,"Liverpool are the only team with a perfect record in this season’s Champions League after beating title-holders Real Madrid 2-0 in their heavyweight clash on Wednesday, with last season’s runners-up Borussia Dortmund among the night’s other winners. The showdown at Anfield saw Real attempting to extend a run of eight games unbeaten against Liverpool. However, Arne Slot’s Premier League leaders were too strong, with Alexis MacAllister putting them ahead early in the second half. Kylian Mbappe endured a frustrating night and squandered a chance to equalise for Madrid after an hour when his penalty was saved. Mohamed Salah then missed from the spot at the other end but substitute Cody Gakpo headed in Liverpool’s second goal on 76 minutes. They are the sole side with five wins from five in this new-look Champions League, and are now guaranteed to advance at least to the knockout phase play-offs in February. ‘You know how special it is to play against a club that won this Champions League so many times, are the reigning champions and were a pain in the ass for Liverpool many times as well,’ said Slot. Real have lost three of their five matches and with six points they are currently 24th, the very last qualifying spot for the knockout phase. Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti had words of comfort for their star French striker, saying: ‘This is a difficult moment for Mbappe. We will support him and give him love.’ Inter Milan sit second on 13 points, followed by Barcelona and Dortmund each on 12, with the Germans winning 3-0 against Dinamo Zagreb in Croatia. A great goal by English youngster Jamie Gittens gave Dortmund a first-half lead, before Ramy Bensebaini headed in on 56 minutes and substitute Serhou Guirassy sealed the win late on. Aston Villa started with three straight victories in the Champions League but were six matches without a win in all competitions before hosting Juventus. The game ended 0-0, with the English side denied in stoppage time when a Morgan Rogers goal was disallowed for a foul on goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio. Villa are just outside the top eight places offering direct access to the last 16, as one of seven teams on 10 points with three fixtures remaining. Monaco missed the chance to cement their top-eight spot as they went down 3-2 at home to Benfica in a dramatic game. Eliesse Ben Seghir gave Monaco an early lead but the visitors were level just after the break as Vangelis Pavlidis profited from a defensive error to score. Monaco were reduced to 10 men when defender Wilfried Singo was sent off for a second yellow, but they still retook the lead as Soungoutou Magassa fired in. However, Benfica’s numerical superiority made the difference late on as Arthur Cabral headed in on 84 minutes and Zeki Amdouni snatched the winner. Lille closed in on securing at least a play-off spot as they won 2-1 in Italy against Bologna, who remain winless. Belgian-born midfielder Ngal’ayel Mukau was the French side’s hero with a brace, including the opener before half-time. Colombian defender Jhon Lucumi equalised for Bologna, but Mukau struck again on 66 minutes to secure Lille’s third win in five matches. Celtic and Club Brugge remain on course for the play-offs after drawing 1-1 in Glasgow, Daizen Maeda’s superb strike earning the Scottish champions a point after they had fallen behind to a farcical Cameron Carter-Vickers own goal. The comeback of the night came from PSV Eindhoven, with the Dutch champions recovering from 2-0 down to win 3-2 against Shakhtar Donetsk. Goals by Danylo Sikan and Oleksandr Zubkov had the Ukrainians 2-0 ahead at half-time at the Philips Stadion. However, they had Brazilian full-back Pedro Henrique sent off on 69 minutes and fell apart late on. Malik Tillman’s free-kick was carried over the line by the goalkeeper on 87 minutes and the same player equalised with a superb long-range strike in the 90th minute. Tillman’s fellow American Ricardo Pepi then got the winner in the fifth added minute. Red Star Belgrade got their first points by coming from behind to hammer Stuttgart 5-1 in Serbia. Ermedin Demirovic gave the Germans an early lead, but Silas Katompa Mvumpa, on loan from Stuttgart, equalised before goals by Rade Krunic and Mirko Ivanic, and a Nemanja Radonjic brace. Austrian champions Sturm Graz are also off the mark after beating Girona 1-0 with a Mika Biereth goal.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/251473/liverpool-exact-revenge-on-madrid
Ishtiaq vows to improve Bangladesh’s position in Davis Cup,"Ishtiaq Ahmed, a well-known figure in Bangladesh’s tennis, is currently serving as the general secretary of the Bangladesh Tennis Federation’s ad hoc committee. In an interview with New Age’s Wahid Ullah Bakul, he stated his desire to reform and improve the country’s game. New Age: Are you confident that this committee is capable of bringing notable progress? Ishtiaq Ahmed:Tennis is an expensive sport, but I’m optimistic about financial support. Our committee consists of diverse professionals committed to voluntary service. If even half of the well-off members are passionate about the game, I believe we can drive meaningful change. NA: Depending on your available resources, what kind of short or long-term plan can you make? Ishtiaq:The initial plan will be to create a strong national player pool through grooming up the available national and age-level players. If we can provide them with good training, we can expect good results within a short time. Side by side, we will have to run the Junior Tennis Initiative training programme to hunt for new talents. I also have a plan to arrange prize-money tournaments, at least four per year, to encourage players to pursue professionalism. Offering substantial prizes, ranging from Tk 1-2 lakh. NA: We never had a star tennis player; what are the obstacles to having one? Ishtiaq:The main obstacle is the financial crisis. A player needs to spend a significant amount of money on kits, food, and nutrition. The federation will have to look into it; otherwise, the aspirants will give up their hopes at the initial stage. We will pass the budget in the first meeting. NA: How would you find new talents when aspirants cannot avail facilities of tennis courts at the district level? Ishtiaq:In the past, we got some potential players from Rajshahi, Noagaon, and Chattogram districts through the talent hunt programme. So, we have plans to launch the talent hunt initiative at the country’s grassroots level. Despite our requests through the NSC [National Sports Council], many district administrators have not provided tennis court facilities for local aspiring players, which is a significant obstacle. However, we will work to ensure afternoon court access for some players in their local areas. NA: What are the prospects for Bangladesh tennis? Ishtiaq:Currently, we at best can expect to uplift our team position in the Davis Cup. Now we are in group five and can advance to group four with our available players. If we set a target now to play in the 16-team world group of the Davis Cup, it will take a minimum of five years with uninterrupted grooming initiative for a new group of players. NA: Considering there is no specific time frame for the tenure of this ad-hoc committee, doesn’t the NSC’s decision seem contradictory? Ishtiaq:There is no ambiguity regarding the indefinite tenure because there is no separate provision for the ad-hoc committee’s tenure in the BTF constitution. Usually, the sports ministry or the NSC mentions a time frame for an ad-hoc committee, but it did not happen this time. So, this committee can run for an indefinite period unless the ministry or NSC interferes. NA: What specific reforms are needed in the BTF, and what plans does the current committee have? Ishtiaq:We will hold our first formal meeting on December 2. If we see any necessary constitutional amendments, we will initiate the changes. We’ll assess the available scopes.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/tennis/251472/ishtiaq-vows-to-improve-bangladeshs-position-in-davis-cup
Guiding Sylhet to NCL title is my biggest achievement: Rajin,"Sylhet Division were at the second tier in the National Cricket League when Rajin Saleh took over the role of the head coach in 2019-20. After three seasons, they’ve become the champions in the country’s premier red ball tournament for the very first time. In an interview with New Age’s Saifullah Bin Anowar, the former Bangladesh national team captain discusses how they worked and what it means to be crowned champions, something he always wanted as a player. New Age: Starting with the obvious question, what was the feeling when you guys clinched your maiden title? Rajin Saleh:I have become tired of saying the same things (laughs). The thing is, when you’ve got a champion team, like you’ve got some star players, then that is one thing. But to become champion with a mediocre team is different. The feeling is hard to describe. To motivate the players is challenging. But ultimately, they gave their best.  NA: What was the expectation when you began the season? Rajin:Firstly, in general, our bowling lineup is one of the best, if not the best in the country. But we’ve had something lacking in our batting. Jaker Ali has been missing due to national duty; we also didn’t get Zakir Hasan that much. Last season, we had Shamsur Rahman Shuvo, but this time we didn’t have him either. But Pinak Ghosh played really well. Amite Hasan is of course here. We’ve been playing with four to five batters. But they’ve risen to the occasion. Even our bowlers contributed to the batting. We played Nasum Ahmed up in the order; that was our plan. He played well. Even Rejaur Rahman Raja, the pacer, batted well. Tofel Ahmed, a new guy, played really good cricket. Dihan, another young guy, played really well at three in the last two matches. When we started practicing two months ago, the players were told that we would go for results—either we would win or lose. When you do some quality work in any sector, you will hope to get quality results. And after the quality pre-season practice sessions, there were expectations that something good could happen. Alhamdulillah, it did happen for the boys.  NA: What about Amite Hasan’s performances? He’s been the top scorer of this season so far... Rajin:Amite has been performing continuously for the last few seasons. To contribute for the team is one thing, but there is another thing—to contribute in wins. Amite contributed to the wins. I think he’s going to be one of the best longer-version players for Bangladesh. I’m not saying that he should be given the opportunity right now; if he is given time to get prepared for some time more, then he will give his best service to the Bangladesh cricket.  NA: What does it mean to you to become champions with Sylhet as a coach? Rajin:I started my coaching career in 2019. I’ve had some achievements. Like last season, I was the head coach of the East Zone, who became champions after 13 years in the BCL. But that was not a huge achievement for me, as I said earlier, to become champion with the best team—the feeling is not that full. But there were many opportunities to work with the Sylhet team. I think I’ve learnt so many things. But to become champions with Sylhet is my greatest achievement. I’ve played for 18-19 years. We, the national players, also tried so many times but couldn’t make Sylhet Champion. Now, as a coach, to become champion with the contribution from my boys, this is my best achievement. Now Sylhet is the champion team of Bangladesh, and they will play like a champion team.  NA: And if you are asked to say something about your pacers. What would you say? Rajin:If you see, the best of the best pace unit is Sylhet. Abu Jayed was injured after two matches. Khaled, Rejaur—they bowled with such efforts that there’s not to expect more, to be honest. Khaled and Rejaur, they will give service to Bangladesh cricket for a long time. They should be recognised. Tofael was a new guy, but he was our best all-rounder. The pacers were simply the best. I must add one thing: the bonding between the bowlers was really great. When every bowler contributes equally and they’ve got the best bonding, then they are bound to do the best things.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251471/guiding-sylhet-to-ncl-title-is-my-biggest-achievement-rajin-
"Economy recovering, but challenges remian: MCCI","Bangladesh’s economy has been gradually recovering from the recent political instability in the first quarter of the 2024-25 financial year, but, several challenges such as high inflation, reduced export activity, shortfall in revenue collection, diminished job opportunities and sluggish investment climate need to be addressed, said the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Dhaka. The political instability, sparked by the anti-discrimination students’ movement, which began in the first week of July 2024 led to a change in government and has resulted in an ongoing transition period, it said. The MCCI in its ‘Review of Economic Situation in Bangladesh July-September 2024’ said that one of the most pressing concerns was restoring law and order. The general inflation rate, although slightly reduced from 10.49 per cent in August to 9.92 per cent in September, remains alarmingly high with prices of many essentials still at an elevated level, it said. Food inflation slightly decreased to 10.40 per cent in September from 11.36 per cent in August. Meanwhile, non-food inflation marginally dropped to 9.50 per cent from 9.74 per cent. People in rural areas were the worst hit of price shocks in September, according to the economic review. It also said that between the June-end of FY24 and September-end of FY25, the taka depreciated by 1.67 per cent against the US dollar. Foreign exchange reserves also saw a decline. The Bangladesh Bank’s gross foreign exchange reserves fell to $24.86 billion at the end of September 2024 from $26.91 billion in September 2023. When adjusted to the balance of payments and international investment position manual, 6th edition, reserves stood at $19.74 billion, down from $21.06 billion a year earlier. The National Board of Revenue’s tax revenue collection decreased by 6.07 per cent to Tk 70,902.90 crore in July-September of FY25 compared with that of Tk 75,487.70 crore in the same period of FY24. The revenue authority fell short by 26.53 per cent of its strategic target of Tk 96,499.90 crore. The annual development programme implementation rate in July-September of FY25 was sluggish at 4.75 per cent, which was also the lowest in at least 15 years. According to experts, the low implementation rate was due to a number of factors, including political turmoil, cautious spending, project review by the interim government initiated by the previous government, among others, the review observed. According to the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division data, 56 ministries and divisions spent Tk 13,215 crore or 4.75 per cent of the total ADP of Tk 2,78,289 crore during July-September of FY25. Data on the industrial sectors’ growth for the first quarter of FY25 were not yet available in the review, however, the sector registered a lower growth of 3.98 per cent in Q4 of FY24, compared with that of 6.25 per cent in the previous quarter. Investment in the private sector remained sluggish. Private sector credit growth registered a lower growth of 9.20 per cent during the period between September 2024 and September 2023, compared with a higher growth of 9.69 per cent during the period between September 2023 and September2022. The net inflows of foreign direct investment in July-September of FY25 decreased year-on-year by 15.01 per cent to $300 million from $353 million. The services sector exhibited lower growth of 3.67 per cent in Q4 of FY24, compared with that of 3.81 per cent in the previous quarter.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/251470/economy-recovering-but-challenges-remian-mcci

BSEC rejects Hami’s share issuance proposal,"The Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission has declined to approve Hami Industries PLC’s proposal to issue 50,00,000 ordinary shares at an issue price of Tk 10 each, citing rule violations by the company’s managing director, ASM Hasib Hasan. Hami Industries, formerly known as Imam Button Industries, changed its name in March. BSEC executive director Rezaul Karim said that the commission rejected the ordinary share issuance request by Hami Industries. ‘We have sent the letter to our enforcement department for further actions through due processes,’ he said. According to a Dhaka Stock Exchange’s post on its web site on Thursday, in a letter to the company dated November 26, the BSEC stated that the decision was taken following the discovery of multiple violations of the Securities and Exchange Ordinance, 1969. The violations conducted by ASM Hasib Hasan include creating false and misleading appearance of share money deposit, in breach of Section 18 of the Ordinance, and submitting fake and fabricated documents to support the utilisation of share money deposits, also in violation of Section 18 of the Ordinance, the DSE web site post said. Section 18 of the BSEC Ordinance, 1969, states, ‘No person shall, in any document, paper, accounts, information or explanation which he is, by or under this Ordinance, required to furnish, or in any application made under this Ordinance, make any statement or give any information which he knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be false or incorrect in any material particular.’ As a result, the commission is ‘not in a position to accord consent’ for the issuance of the proposed shares, the web site said.

S Korea surprises with 2nd successive rate cut,"South Korea’s central bank cut interest rates Thursday for the second time in a row in a surprise move, citing stabilising inflation and the need to mitigate growing economic risks. The Bank of Korea’s 0.25 percentage point reduction, which followed a similar move in October, lowers the benchmark rate to 3.0 per cent and comes as authorities around the world ease monetary policies after years of hikes aimed at tackling soaring prices. It also cut its growth outlook for Asia’s fourth largest economy. The BOK said in a news release that it made the decision because ‘inflation stabilisation has continued along with an ongoing slowdown in household debt, and downward pressure on economic growth has intensified’. The monetary policy board called the cut ‘appropriate... to mitigate downside risks to the economy’. ‘The currently available information suggests that the global economy has been facing heightened uncertainties surrounding growth and inflation, driven by the new US administration’s policies,’ it added, referring to the re-election of Donald Trump, who has pledged to renew his hardball approach to trade. The pace of further rate cuts will be ‘determined by how the current rate cuts affect inflation, growth, household debt, and the currency rate down the road’, BOK chief Rhee Chang-yong said at a news briefing. The consecutive rate cuts follow a sharp fall in consumer inflation to 1.3 per cent in October, largely driven by declining energy prices. The bank also lowered its economic expansion forecast for this year to 2.2 per cent, from an earlier projection of 2.4 per cent, citing a slowdown in export growth. It warned that there were still uncertainties for the economy, including ‘changes in the trade environment, trends in IT exports, and the pace of recovery in domestic demand’.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/251466/s-korea-surprises-with-2nd-successive-rate-cut
Masato Kanda becomes ADB president,"The Asian Development Bank’s board of governors has elected Masato Kanda as ADB’s 11th president. Kanda, 59, currently serves as special adviser to Japan’s prime minister and finance minister. He will assume office on February 24, 2025, succeeding Masatsugu Asakawa, who will leave office on February 23, 2025, said an ADB press release. Kanda will complete the unexpired term of president Asakawa, which ends on November 23, 2026. ‘Kanda’s extensive experience in international finance and proven leadership in multilateral settings will serve ADB well in navigating complex global economic challenges and fostering international cooperation,’ said Fabio Panetta, chairman of the ADB board of governors and governor of the Bank of Italy. ‘The ADB board of governors looks forward to working with Kanda,’ the chairman added.

German inflation rises above 2pc in Nov,"German inflation rose slightly in November, climbing back above the European Central Bank’s two-per cent target, according to preliminary data released Thursday. The annual inflation rate in Europe’s biggest economy increased to 2.2 per cent, up from two per cent in October, figures from federal statistics agency Destatis showed. The rebound in inflation was widely anticipated but lower than the 2.3-per cent rate predicted by analysts surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. ECB policymakers had also predicted eurozone inflation, of which the German figures are a major component, would rise again going into 2025. But the central bank for the 20 countries that use the euro has said it still expects the rate to edge back towards two per cent over the following months. The bump in the inflation outlook has not deterred the central bank from lowering interest rates in recent months. From a high of four per cent, reached in the wake of soaring inflation caused by the coronavirus pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the ECB has lowered its key deposit rate to 3.25 per cent. The Frankfurt-based institution is expected to lower rates again at its next meeting in December amid signs of weakness in the eurozone economy. The increase in the German inflation rate was ‘mainly the result of less favourable energy base effects’, ING bank analyst Carsten Brzeski said. The rate could remain at a level that was ‘slightly too high’ for a while longer as wages continued to increase, Brzeski said. The November figures could discourage some ECB decision makers from seeking to implement a 50-basis-point rate cut in December and lean instead towards a smaller quarter-point cut, he said. ‘Even more important... is the question of how far the ECB will eventually go with rate cuts’ beyond December, Brzeski said. Inflation in Spain also accelerated in November, hitting 2.4 per cent due to higher fuel and electricity prices after reaching 1.8 per cent in October, official data showed Thursday.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/251464/german-inflation-rises-above-2pc-in-nov

Adani fraud claims trigger opposition probe demand in India,"India’s parliament was disrupted for a third day by opposition parties on Thursday protesting the government’s silence over allegations against billionaire Gautam Adani, who was recently indicted in the US for alleged fraud and a scheme to pay bribes. As speaker Om Birla convened the powerful lower house of parliament, opposition members shot up from their seats and crowded the aisles, shouting anti-government slogans. The Congress and other opposition parties have accused the government of prime minister Narendra Modi of protecting Adani, an Indian coal magnate. ‘I don’t appreciate the manner of protest,’ Birla said, adjourning the session over the opposition disruptions. The session later resumed but was adjourned for the day with the deadlock between the government and the opposition continuing. Proceedings in parliament’s upper house were also adjourned, and the Congress party was unyielding in its stance. The opposition called for a joint committee to investigate Adani’s companies, which include agriculture, renewable energy, coal and infrastructure. Adani, 62, one of Asia’s richest men, was thrust into the spotlight last week when US prosecutors in New York charged him and seven of his associates with securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and wire fraud. The charges allege that Adani duped investors in a massive solar project in India by concealing that it was being facilitated by bribes. The indictment outlines an alleged scheme to pay about $265 million in bribes to Indian government officials. The Adani Group, in a statement last week, said that the allegations by the US department of justice and the US securities and exchange commission against directors of Adani Green were baseless. ‘The charges in the indictment are allegations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. All possible legal recourse will be sought,’ the statement said. In the absence of a statement by the Indian government, Amit Malviya, the governing Bharatiya Janata Party’s IT head, also said in a post on the social media platform X that the US charges were allegations and the defendants were presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty, which critics interpreted as a show of support by the Modi government for the Adani Group. The controversy has already affected Adani’s interests overseas. Kenya’s president cancelled multimillion-dollar deals with the Adani Group for airport modernisation and energy projects. Adani will also face scrutiny in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. A Sri Lankan government spokesperson said earlier this week that it was reviewing projects to be implemented by the Adani Group in Sri Lanka. The group was set to invest over $440 million under a 20-year agreement to develop 484 megawatts of wind power in the north-eastern regions of Sri Lanka and develop a terminal in the Colombo port. ‘We are taking it seriously. The foreign ministry and the finance ministry are inquiring into it. We will take the decision according to the reports of both ministries,’ spokesperson Nalinda Jayatissa said. Bangladesh’s interim government is reviewing an agreement under which the Adani Group supplies electricity to Bangladesh from a power project in India.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/251459/adani-fraud-claims-trigger-opposition-probe-demand-in-india
Hope for justice for Rohingyas,"THE public statement of ICC prosecutor Karim Khan KC on the arrest warrant application against General Min Aung Hlaing during his recent visit to Bangladesh is a long-awaited but anticipated development in the ICC’s quest to ensure justice for the deported Rohingya population currently taking shelter in Bangladeshi refugee camps. It is alleged that the acting president of Myanmar and commander-in-chief of the Myanmar Defence Services bears criminal responsibility for the crimes against humanity of deportation and persecution of the Rohingya. Now, the matter is pending final determination before a pre-trial chamber of the ICC. The ICC prosecutor further indicated that he may come up with more arrest warrant applications against top-ranked Burmese leaders in the Bangladesh-Myanmar situation. The arrest warrant application resulted from the five-year-long investigation of the ICC’s Office of the Prosecutor. This development surfaced at a time when the ICC has been struggling with the fallout of its activities in other situations, notably the Palestine situation. Though the Office of the Prosecutor began its formal investigation in November 2019 following the authorisation of the pre-trial chamber, its procrastination in issuing arrest warrants against alleged Myanmar accused, despite mounting evidence, was widely criticised by the international community. The Bangladesh/Myanmar situation is noted for its unique procedural history. The ICC, being a treaty-based international court, can generally exercise its jurisdiction over its member states. It was initially believed that the ICC did not enjoy any jurisdiction over the Rohingya situation due to Myanmar’s status as a non-party state to the Rome Statute. Nevertheless, given the transboundary nature of the Rohingya deportation and Bangladesh’s status as a party to the Rome Statute, the then ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda took the unbeaten path to request the pre-trial chamber for a ruling to confirm the ICC’s jurisdiction over the deportation. Finally, the chamber confirmed the ICC’s jurisdiction over the Rohingya deportation on September 6, 2018 since the alleged crimes commenced in Myanmar but were completed in Bangladesh. However, the ICC does not enjoy jurisdiction over all the crimes committed completely in Myanmar for the same. In the aftermath of the ICC’s confirmation of jurisdiction over the Rohingya deportation and persecution, the erstwhile prosecutor commenced the preliminary examination on the basis of her proprio motu power. She subsequently requested authorisation for an investigation before the pre-trial chamber on June 12, 2019, which was duly confirmed on November 14, 2019. As mentioned earlier, the prosecutor finally filed an arrest warrant application against General Hlaing on November 27, 2024. This complex and time-consuming procedural patchwork is important to understand the nature of the arrest warrant application and its prospects. In fact, the ICC is reputed for its lengthy procedural timelines. It has been evident that the Office of the Prosecutor was relatively abrupt in commencing its investigation. On the contrary, it took an unusually lengthy time to proceed to the arrest warrant application despite having a wealth of incriminating evidence at its disposal, primarily collected by UN investigative bodies and subsequently by the Office of the Prosecutor itself. While the ICC was deeply involved in the Ukraine and Palestine situations with investigations and arrest warrant applications in the last three years, its omission to shed light on the Bangladesh/Myanmar situation was marked by dismay among the Rohingya community. Ultimately, the prosecutor’s announcement of the arrest warrant application while standing in the Rohingya refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar is really significant for the Rohingya community. The arrest warrant application has both symbolic and legal value. Legally, the application is subject to confirmation by a pre-trial chamber. It is very unlikely that the pre-trial chamber will decline to confirm the same. Very recently, the ICC issued arrest warrants against Russian president Vladimir Putin and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu despite their political sensitivity. Though the Myanmar leadership has some politically powerful allies, including China, the fact that the president of a permanent member of the UN Security Council has been subject to an ICC arrest warrant indicates that the ICC will rely on legal considerations rather than political repercussions while ruling on the arrest warrant. The arrest warrant application against General Hlaing invites some inevitable legal complications. Most importantly, the Rome Statute does not provide for trials in absentia. Consequently, the issue of producing General Hlaing comes to the forefront. At this instance, his status as the head of state will be a hurdle in securing his presence before the ICC. This is due to the question of the immunity of high-ranking government officials, which is alleged to be unsettled in international law. The ICC has been struggling to arrest several incumbent heads of state and heads of government of non-party states to the ICC. It has been an issue of legal and political discontent between the ICC and a number of ICC member states. These include Omar al-Bashir, Vladimir Putin, and, very recently, Benjamin Netanyahu. The arrest warrant application against General Hlaing, if ultimately issued, will resurface the same issue. The absence of the accused before the ICC means the halt of the proceedings of a case. In that case, General Hlaing may succeed in escaping ICC proceedings by avoiding the arrest warrant. But it will not prevent him from facing the political consequences. He will be forced to rethink his international travel routes for the rest of his life. Global leaders will also reconsider their political and financial dealings with an ICC accused like him. It has been seen in the past that arrest warrants issued by international criminal courts and tribunals have also impacted the ground realities of conflicts. When Myanmar is struggling in its domestic war theatre against rebels, this arrest warrant application, coupled with the prosecutor’s intention to lodge additional applications, will certainly affect the morale of the Myanmar military leadership. It will not be completely surprising if this arrest warrant application impacts the overall conflict situation in Myanmar. The arrest warrant application can also be seen as a symbolic victory for the Rohingya community. It has already been seven years since the Rohingya were deported from their homeland to Bangladesh. Despite the hope for justice brought by the ICC in the early days of its investigation back in 2019, its delay in issuing arrest warrants despite two rounds of visits by prosecutor Karim Khan to Bangladesh raised questions about the effectiveness of the ICC itself. With this arrest warrant application in place, the Rohingya community will regain the moral strength to rethink their quest for justice and accountability. This arrest warrant application also coincides with Myanmar’s application for extending the deadline for submitting its response to The Gambia’s allegation of the Rohingya genocide before the International Court of Justice, ICJ. It indicates that the junta-led Myanmar government will contest the ICJ case. It was speculated that Myanmar might opt to remain absent in the merits stage before the ICJ after its defeat in the preliminary objections stage. However, the indication that Myanmar will participate in the ICJ proceedings should be welcomed by the Rohingya community because it is preferable to have a hard-won legal battle than an overwhelming ex parte judgement. Bangladesh should also take this moment to reinforce its diplomatic efforts to secure the safe and dignified repatriation of the Rohingya community at both bilateral and multilateral levels. At the same time, Bangladesh should reconsider intervening in the Rohingya genocide case before the ICJ.  Quazi Omar Foysal is an international law expert. He was part of the amicus curiae observation submitted by Bangladeshi non-government representatives in support of the ICC Prosecution’s request for jurisdiction over the Rohingya deportation.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/opinion/251458/hope-for-justice-for-rohingyas
Bangladesh Army highlights activities since July 20 deployment,"The Bangladesh Army has described the extensive activities undertaken since its deployment on July 20, aimed at curbing anarchy, maintaining religious harmony, ensuring the safety of foreign missions, and safeguarding key national installations across the country. At a media briefing held at the Officers’ Mess in Banani, Colonel Intekhab Haider Khan, Colonel Staff of the Directorate of Military Operations, described the army’s operations spanning 62 districts. Working in coordination with the interim government, ministries, law enforcement, and local administrations, army personnel have strived to uphold law and order.

Petition claims temple beneath Ajmer Sharif,"A court in Rajasthan’s Ajmer issued notices on Wednesday to the union ministry of minority affairs and ASI on a lawsuit filed by a Hindu organisation laying claim to the site of the dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, citing ‘historical evidence’ of the existence of a Shiva temple there before the white marble shrine to the 13th-century Sufi saint was built over his tomb, reports The Times of India. The Ajmer munsif criminal and civil (west) court will next hear Delhi-based Hindu Sena’s civil suit on December 20. The Dargah Khwaja Saheb committee, a statutory body constituted by the minority affairs ministry, is the third respondent in the case. Advocate Yogesh Suroliya, one of Hindu Sena’s three counsels, said the legal team submitted to the court a copy of former judicial officer and academician Har Bilas Sarda’s 1911 book ‘Ajmer: Historical and Descriptive’, which purportedly mentions that remnants from a ‘pre-existing’ Shiva temple at the site were used in building the dargah. ‘We informed the court that there were continuous religious rituals at the temple till it was razed,’ fellow advocate Ram Swaroop Bishnoi said. Vijay Sharma, the third counsel, sought a survey by ASI of the premises to verify the petitioner’s contention that the dome of the dargah contains ‘pieces of the temple’ and that ‘there is evidence of the presence of a sanctum sanctorum in the basement’. The lawsuit is similar to the Gyanvapi case, involving multiple Hindu plaintiffs who contend that the mosque in UP’s Varanasi was built over the remains of a destroyed temple. ASI has already conducted a court-ordered survey there. The Krishna Janmabhoomi litigation in Mathura is another one, pertaining to a dispute over the ownership of the land where the Shahi Idgah now stands. In the Ajmer dargah case, Hindu Sena president Vishnu Gupta filed the petition in September but the initial hearing on the merit of the lawsuit was delayed because of a jurisdictional wrangle. The district and sessions judge then transferred the suit to the munsif court (west). The hearing was further delayed by the designated court asking for the petition in English to be translated into Hindi and submitted along with evidence and an affidavit. ‘The 38 pages of the lawsuit contain as many points of reference to show that a Shiva temple pre-existed where the dargah is located,’ an advocate said. ‘As in the Gyanvapi case, the Places of Worship Act, 1991, cannot be invoked to negate this suit.’ Syed Sarwar Chishty, secretary of the Anjuman Moinia Fakhria, a body representing the dargah’s hereditary caretakers, dismissed the Hindu side’s arguments about the existence of a Shiva temple at the site of the Sufi shrine as baseless. ‘These frivolous assertions are aimed at harming the country’s  communal harmony. The dargah is one of the most revered places for Muslims after Makkah and Medina. Such actions deeply hurt the sentiments of devotees worldwide,’ he said in a video-recorded statement.

Camavinga joins Real Madrid injury list,"French midfielder Eduardo Camavinga has joined Real Madrid's growing injury list after injuring his thigh in Wednesday's 2-0 Champions League defeat in Liverpool. ‘The player has been diagnosed with a muscular injury in the biceps femoris of his left leg. His progress will be monitored,’ Real Madrid said in a statement without revealing the length of his absence. According to Spanish press reports Camavinga, who already injured his knee last September, is expected to be sidelined for between two and three weeks. The 22-year-old came off in the 56th minute with the same injury which has kept teammate Vinicius Junior out of action for several weeks. Madrid have various players out injured for long periods, including Dani Carvajal and Eder Militao with severe knee injuries. According to several Spanish media reports Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Brahim Diaz also finished the match in pain and will undergo medical tests on Friday. Champions League holders Real have lost three of their five matches and with six points they are currently 24th, the very last qualifying spot for the knockout phase.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/251451/camavinga-joins-real-madrid-injury-list
"PSG, Real toil as giants struggle to get to grips with new Champions League","The new Champions League format leaves plenty of margin for error for clubs aiming to reach the knockout rounds, and yet European heavyweights such as Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain are currently at risk of an early exit. UEFA's flagship competition has been revolutionised to breathe new life into a tournament which had not undergone any changes for two decades. However, the alterations were also made to satisfy the continent's biggest clubs by providing more games, and more revenue, at a time when the threat of a breakaway Super League hung in the air. With eight matches now in the league phase rather than six games in the old group stage, there is more margin for error than before, but there is more jeopardy too. Take PSG, semi-finalists last season. They were certainly weakened ahead of this campaign by the loss of Kylian Mbappe to Madrid, yet they were also handed a devilish set of fixtures. With all 36 teams in the league phase playing eight games against eight different sides -- two from each of four pots of seeds -- PSG's calendar was rated as the hardest according to sports statisticians Opta. They have lost away to Arsenal and Bayern Munich, and at home to Atletico Madrid, and still have Manchester City to come. With just four points from five matches, they are 25th, one place and two points outside the qualifying spots for the knockout phase play-offs. Luis Enrique's team surely now must at least win two of their remaining three matches to avoid elimination. ‘Rather than our three defeats I prefer to talk about the three matches we have left to play, three finals,’ insisted Luis Enrique after Tuesday's 1-0 loss in Munich. ‘We have dropped too many points at home against teams who have not played as well as us.’ Reigning champions Real, meanwhile, had lost just once in 20 Champions League matches coming into this season and the arrival of Mbappe threatened to make them even more formidable. Instead, Wednesday's 2-0 reverse against Liverpool -- as a disappointing Mbappe had a penalty saved -- was their third defeat in five outings in this season's competition. Apart from that game at Anfield, Real's fixtures have not appeared overly difficult, but they occupy 24th spot, the last qualifying berth for the knockout phase. However, with remaining opponents including Salzburg and Brest, Carlo Ancelotti's side will surely reach the next round. ‘We've got three games left in the group and it's important that we go and try and win all of them to give ourselves the best possible chance in the standings,’ Real's Jude Bellingham told broadcaster TNT Sports on Wednesday. After five matches, Liverpool are the only side with a perfect record and the only team already guaranteed to at least be in the play-offs. Even Inter Milan, second on 13 points, are not absolutely certain to be through just yet, although it would take an unlikely combination of results to deny them now. Nobody yet is certain to finish in the top eight, which offers a direct path to the last 16 without having to go through February's play-offs. Other leading sides with work still to do to seal a play-off place include Juventus and Manchester City, whose spectacular surrender of a three-goal lead to draw with Feyenoord leaves them with only two wins so far. There is a strong chance that some highly unfancied names will reach the knockout phase, including French outfit Brest and possibly Dinamo Zagreb. Regular Champions League whipping boys under the old format, the Croatians started their campaign by losing 9-2 to Bayern Munich and were comfortably beaten by Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday. However, they are currently 23rd on seven points, just above Madrid, and have a huge home game against Celtic next. The Scottish champions, meanwhile, have taken advantage of what Opta rated as the easiest draw in the league phase and are 20th just now, on eight points. ‘We're on eight points, nine to play for. We're still very much on course to get to where we want to get to and still three games to go,’ Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers said following Wednesday's 1-1 draw at home to Club Brugge.

DMP commissioner calls on OCs to build public trust,"Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Sheikh Md Sajjad Ali has directed the officers-in-charge of all police stations to improve the image of police force by delivering quality services to the common people. Speaking at a views exchange meeting at the DMP Headquarters with the OCs of 50 police stations in Dhaka metropolitan area on Thursday, the commissioner emphasised that police stations are the central hub for law enforcement services and must operate with greater accountability. He urged the OCs to ensure that service seekers receive prompt and effective assistance when they visit police stations. ‘You are the ones who take legal action,’ said the DMP Commissioner, stressing the pivotal role of police stations in implementing police activities. He noted that many legal matters eventually reach the OCs for resolution, and their responsibility is crucial in shaping the public’s perception of the police force. Acknowledging concerns about the tarnished image of the police in the past, he said, ‘The police’s image has suffered due to the actions of some overambitious officers. However, you must work in such a way that no complaints are filed against any officer. I do not wish to take action against anyone, but if any complaint arises, there will be no concessions.’ He further underscored the importance of building stronger relationships with the community, saying, ‘The more rapport you build with people, the more information you will receive. This will enable you to take preventive action before crimes are committed.’ The commissioner also called for fair and proper investigations in all cases. The meeting also provided a platform for the OCs to discuss the challenges and issues they face in their operations. The DMP Commissioner listened attentively to their concerns and assured them that solutions would be implemented in phases. Additional police commissioners Faruk Ahmed (Admin), Rezaul Karim Mallick (Intelligence), Md Masud Karim (CTTC), Hasan Md Shawkat Ali (Logistics, Finance, and Procurement), along with the concerned joint police commissioners, deputy police commissioners, were also present.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251447/dmp-commissioner-calls-on-ocs-to-build-public-trust
Lampard appointed Coventry manager,"Frank Lampard was appointed manager of Championship side Coventry City on Thursday as the former England midfielder aims to rebuild his coaching career. The 46-year-old has been out of work since an ill-fated second spell in charge of Chelsea as interim boss for the final months of the 2022/23 season. Coventry sit 17th in the English second tier and controversially sacked Mark Robins, who led them to the FA Cup semi-finals last season, earlier this month. Lampard has signed a two-and-a-half-year contract and will take charge for the first time at home to Cardiff City on Saturday. ‘I am delighted that Frank Lampard has agreed to join our club as head coach,’ said Coventry owner Doug King. ‘Frank cut his teeth in the Championship and knows what is needed in this league to be successful. ‘His experiences thereafter at Chelsea and Everton will ensure he brings to our talented squad clear understanding of exactly what is needed to succeed at the very top level that we as a club are striving to reach.’ Chelsea's all-time leading goalscorer, Lampard has so far failed to match his glorious playing career since moving into management. After an impressive one season at Derby County in the Championship, he was handed the Chelsea job for the first time in 2019. However, he was sacked after 18 months with the Blues ninth in the Premier League and had to watch his successor Thomas Tuchel go on to win the Champions League later that season. He was also dismissed after a year in charge of Everton in 2023. Lampard returned to Stamford Bridge a few months later but managed just one win in 11 games as Chelsea finished 12th in the Premier League.

Sri Lanka crash to record low Test total of 42 in South Africa,"Fast bowler Marco Jansen took 7-13 as South Africa skittled Sri Lanka for just 42 in their first innings on the second day of the first Test at Kingsmead in Durban on Thursday. It was the lowest innings total in Sri Lanka's history, eclipsing their previous lowest total of 71 against Pakistan in Kandy in 1994. The lowest score ever in Test cricket remains New Zealand's 26 against England in Auckland in 1955. It was also the lowest total by any team against South Africa, three fewer than New Zealand's 45 in Cape Town in 2013. It is, however, the second shortest completed innings in the history of Test cricket, lasting just 83 balls, eight short of the overall record of the 75 balls that South Africa lasted when they were bowled out for 30 by England in Birmingham in 1924. Only two batsmen reached double figures on a pitch which has helped seam bowlers throughout. Kamindu Mendis stroked three fours in making 13 before edging a loose drive against left-arm paceman Jansen to first slip – and number 10 batsmen Lahiru Kumara slogged two fours in making 10 not out. South Africa, who were earlier bowled out for 191, lead by 149 runs going into the second innings. Captain Temba Bavuma top-scored for them with 70. The only other home batsman to top 20 was Keshav Maharaj, batting at number 10, who made a quick 24.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251444/sri-lanka-crash-to-record-low-test-total-of-42-in-south-africa
Australia passes social media ban for under 16s,"Lawmakers in Australia passed landmark rules to ban under 16s from social media on Thursday, approving one of the world’s toughest crackdowns on popular sites like Facebook, Instagram and X. The bill has now passed both parliamentary chambers with bipartisan support, and social media firms will soon be expected to take ‘reasonable steps’ to prevent young teens from having accounts. The firms -- who face fines of up to Aus$50 million (US$32.5 million) for failing to comply -- have described the laws as ‘vague’, ‘problematic’ and ‘rushed’. The legislation passed parliament’s lower chamber on Wednesday and passed the Senate late on Thursday evening. It is now all but certain to become law. Centre-left Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, eyeing an election early next year, has enthusiastically championed the new rules and rallied Aussie parents to get behind it. In the run up to the vote, he painted social media as ‘a platform for peer pressure, a driver of anxiety, a vehicle for scammers and, worst of all, a tool for online predators’. He wanted, he said, young Australians ‘off their phones and onto the footy and cricket field, the tennis and netball courts, in the swimming pool’. But young Australians like 12-year-old Angus Lydom, are not impressed. ‘I’d like to keep using it. And it’ll be a weird feeling to not have it, and be able to talk to all my friends at home,’ he told AFP. Many are likely to try to find ways around it. ‘I’ll find a way. And so will all my other friends’ Lydom said. Similarly, 11-year-old Elsie Arkinstall said there was still a place for social media, particularly for children wanting to watch tutorials about baking or art, many of which appear on social media. ‘Kids and teens should be able to explore those techniques because you can’t learn all those things from books,’ she added. On paper, the ban is one of the strictest in the world. But the current legislation offers almost no details on how the rules will be enforced -- prompting concern among experts that it will simply be a symbolic piece of legislation that is unenforceable. It will be at least 12 months before the details are worked out by regulators and the ban comes into effect. Some companies will likely be granted exemptions, such as WhatsApp and YouTube, which teenagers may need to use for recreation, school work or other reasons. Late amendments were introduced to ensure government-issued digital ID cannot be used as a means of age verification. Social media expert Susan Grantham told AFP that digital literacy programmes that teach children to think ‘critically’ about what they see online should be adopted -- similar to a model used in Finland. The legislation will be closely monitored by other countries, with many weighing whether to implement similar bans. Lawmakers from Spain to Florida have proposed social media bans for young teens, although none of the measures have been implemented yet. China has restricted access for minors since 2021, with under-14s not allowed to spend more than 40 minutes a day on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. Online gaming time for children is also limited in China.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/oceania/251443/australia-passes-social-media-ban-for-under-16s
Families for lodging complaint with ICT to unearth truth of Pilkhana BDR carnage,"The families of the victims of the 2009 Pilkhana carnage on Thursday announced that they would lodge a complaint to the International Crimes Tribunal against deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina and others over the massacre. Saquib Rahman, son of slain Colonel Quadrat Elahi Rahman Shafique, came up with the information at a press conference at the Retired Armed Forces Officers’ Welfare Association building in the capital’s Mohakhali, saying that they would submit the complaint within two weeks. In February 25-26, 2009, carnage at the then BDR headquarters in the capital’s Pilkhana left 57 military officers and 17 civilians killed, including the chief of the BDR, Major General Shakil Ahmed. Saquib said they would file the complaint against a number of people of the then government, including Sheikh Hasina and the then chiefs of the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence and National Security Intelligence, and others who were involved in the Pilkhana massacre. Hasina’s former security adviser, Major General (retired) Tarique Ahmed Siddique; former lawmakers Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, Sheikh Selim, and Jahangir Kabir Nanak; and others would also be accused, he added. Nehreen Ferdousi, wife of slain Colonel Mujibul Hoque, presented six-point demand at the press conference urging the interim government to launch a fresh investigation for the sake of a fair trial and give a progress report regarding the proposed inquiry commission. The other demands include that all investigation reports related to the tragedy be made public, February 25 be officially recognised as ‘Shaheed Shena Dibash’ through an official gazette before February 2025, and the national flag be flown at half-mast every year on this day, and the 57 brave soldiers who were killed should be given the status of martyrs through an official gazette. Apart from this, she also demanded that the Pilkhana tragedy should be included in the syllabus of school textbooks, and all innocent people who were arrested should be given speedy release by completing the trial quickly. Echoing the six-point demand, Rakin Ahmed Bhuiyan, son of Maj Gen Shakil Ahmed and Naznin Ahmed, both of whom were killed during the carnage, accused the then Awami League government of carrying out the massacre and demanded the identification of the mastermind involved behind the scenes. Victim family members also said that the narrative about a dispute over ‘Operation Dal-Bhat’ leading to the killings is false, saying that it was spread with the intention of diverting attention away from the actual motives behind the killings. Terming the massacre as planned murder, they said that then top officials of the government and security forces, India and its intelligence agency were involved in the incident. The fascist Sheikh Hasina killed the 57 army officers, otherwise the Hasina government could not cling to the state power for 15 years, they said. The victim family members urged the interim government to ensure justice through transparent probe and trial over the incident and bring the mastermind involved with the incident to book.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251442/families-for-lodging-complaint-with-ict-to-unearth-truth-of-pilkhana-bdr-carnage
Rohingyas trying to collect NIDs illegally: EC,"The Election Commission said on Thursday that displaced Rohingya people, who took shelter in Cox’s Bazar fleeing persecution in Myanmar, were trying to collect national identity cards from different election offices in Bangladesh. ‘It has recently been observed that Rohingyas are involved in evil efforts to collect NIDs from various districts and upazila election offices in the country,’ said the Election Commission. But no one other than Bangladeshi citizens can be enrolled in the country’s voter lists as per the article 7 (1) (Ka) of the Electoral Rolls Act 2009, said the commission. ‘Despite this, some unscrupulous people and circles of brokers in Bangladesh are helping Rohingyas become voters, which is a punishable offence under the Electoral Rolls Act, 2009 and the National Identity Registration Act, 2010,’ said the EC.

"ISKCON says Chinmoy no longer with them, not involved in protest","The International Society for Krishna Consciousness, known as ISKCON, on Thursday claimed that the organisation was not involved in the protest staged for the release of its former leader Chinmoy Krishna Das and said that it was not liable for his offences. At a press conference on Thursday at Swamibag Temple in the Old Town of the capital, the ISKCON Bangladesh general secretary Charu Chandra Das Brahmachari said that they had expelled Chinmoy Krishna Das and two others the organisation several months ago as their activities went against the  organisation’s constitution. ‘We demanded that the government, people and journalists find out the fact behind spreading falsehood over ISKCON,’ said Charu Chandra Das, hours after the High Court dismissed a petition demanding a ban on ISKCON in Bangladesh. Amid the countrywide protest by students, people and political parties demanding a ban on ISKCON for the murder of lawyer Saiful Islam Alif in Chattogram, he also claimed that the organisation was not linked to the murder. He also urged the government for ensure trial into the lawyer killing. Responding to a question, ISKCON Bangladesh executive committee and children protection group member Gauranga Das said that several children alleged against Chinmoy over misconduct and unethical behaviour and a letter was served to Chinmoy for the matter. He said that Chinmoy was asked to refrain from organizational work for three months. But he neither followed the call nor paid any heed to organisation’s directives. ‘This is why he was expelled permanently from ISKCON Bangladesh in July,’ he added. ISKCON Bangladesh is promoting unity and harmony, the ISKCON leader Charu said, adding that it had never been involved in communal or conflict-driven activities. He said that they were scheduled to hold a meeting with the land adviser Hasan Arif on Sunday. On Tuesday, assistant public prosecutor Saiful Islam Alif was killed and 25 others injured during a clash between members of Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote, a platform of the Hindu community, and law enforcement agencies on a Chattogram court premises over sending Chinmoy to jail in a sedition case.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251440/iskcon-says-chinmoy-no-longer-with-them-not-involved-in-protest
Don’t pave the path for return of fascism: Fakhrul,"Bangladesh Nationalist Party secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Thursday warned that there was a possibility for the return of fascism in the country. ‘Fascism has been defeated, but it can return any time. We must not pave that path. Unfortunately, we are engaging in such activities that have created a significant chance for its return,’ the BNP leader said while speaking at a views-exchange programme at the Jatiya Press Club in Dhaka. Jatiya Kabita Parishad arranged the event titled ‘The role of writers and artistes in overhauling’. The BNP leader also said that fascist forces were attempting to create an awful situation in Bangladesh in a calculated way. ‘But why are those of us who had fought are now creating disunity? We become fearful when we hear conflicting statements from different places. There are efforts under way to push the country to a different direction through various street agitations,’ he said. Fakhrul said that the nation must now unite around a single goal: to build a truly democratic state by re-establishing parliament after implementing the necessary reforms. ‘Overall, I would like to say, we all should not create division. We must move forward utilising the scope (created through the mass upsurge) keeping the unity intact. It is also our misfortune that, even after 53 years of independence, we have not been able to ensure a peaceful transfer of power,’ he said. The BNP leader called on people from all walks of life, including writers, artistes, and intellectuals, to play a responsible role in inspiring the nation to achieve the desired goal. Fakhrul said writers and artistes have long played a vital role in reshaping the state. ‘But this was not evident during the movement against the fascist regime of Hasina,’ he said. He also said building a democratic Bangladesh and fostering a democratic culture through necessary reforms was a challenging task. ‘We must accomplish this through the united efforts of people from all sectors of society,’ he added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251439/dont-pave-the-path-for-return-of-fascism-fakhrul

Debapriya surprised as looted assets not confiscated,"Centre for Policy Dialogue distinguished fellow Debapriya Bhattacharya on Thursday expressed his dissatisfaction as to why the assets amassed through looting had not been confiscated. He made the question while talking in a discussion on ‘Current Economic Situation and Launching of Open Budget Survey 2023 Bangladesh Results’ in the capital. ‘What a revolution it is!’ Debapriya commended indicating the spirit of the mass uprising that ousted the Awami League regime and paved the way for the interim government assuming the power. Debapriya, chief of the committee formed to prepare a ‘White Paper on the State of Bangladesh Economy’, hoped that the confiscation of such assets would encourage people to pay taxes. The event was organised by Research and Policy Integration for Development and the Economic Reporter’s Forum. RAPID chairman Mohammad Abdur Razzaque said the next six months were crucial for the country’s economic recovery as the ousted regime took the economy to almost brink of ruination with reckless decisions. He said that increasing forex reserve should be the top priority to check the inflation prevailing close to the double-digit for the past two years as he was describing the current economic situation. Commenting on Razzaque’s observation, Debapriya said the country’s economic situation had been more complicated than the general apprehension. He said that his committee had already identified the reckless decisions and mismanagement flaws by the previous regime in the white paper which will be made public on December 2. Elaborating the steps taken by the interim government, especially on the economic front, he said worries and uncertainty were still there. It should be assessed whether there was lack of confidences and patience among ordinary people, he said, adding that the ongoing reform programme might not be successful in absence of economic comfort. Earlier, RAPID executive director M Abu Eusuf said the finance ministry should engage with vulnerable and underrepresented people, directly or through civil society organisations representing them. Referring to country’s position on the ‘Open Budget Survey 2023’ of the global network International Budget Partnership, he said Bangladesh had scored 37 points in transparency and ranked 81st among 125 counties, while the global average of 61 indicates a country publishing enough data to support informed public. Bangla daily Prothom Alo online editor Shawkat Hossain Masum and finance division joint secretary Anarul Kabir took part in the discussion as panelists.

The hosts went to tea at a healthy 193-3 and slumped to 252-7 before Glenn Phillips (41 not out) and Matt Henry (18) halted the collapse with a spirited 46-run stand for the eighth wicket. Shoaib Bashir, the only specialist spinner in the Test, was England's chief destroyer with 4-69. It left the contest finely balanced. ‘It's a good, fair surface,’ Williamson said. ‘On a surface like that you ride a bit of luck and I played and missed a bit, that's just the nature of the beast.’ The 21-year-old Bashir did not expect to be bowling on day one and was surprised to find himself facing Williamson, New Zealand's greatest Test run scorer. ‘Obviously he's a world class player and for me, bowling to someone like him, I was just in awe watching Kane Williamson bat,’ he said. ‘I bowled plenty of bad balls out there but I was still kept on and that shows how much faith they (management) have in me.’ Former skipper Williamson looked on track to put New Zealand into a dominant position after joining Tom Latham in the middle when they lost opener Devon Conway in the second over. He faced 14 deliveries before getting off the mark and went on to anchor 50-run partnerships with Latham, Rachin Ravindra and Daryl Mitchell. Williamson was instrumental in getting them to 227-4 before he was undone attempting a cut shot that went to Zac Crawley at point to give Gus Atkinson his second wicket. England had started the Test with a roar, winning the toss and, bowling on a green top, having Atkinson remove Conway almost immediately. But for the rest of the first two sessions, the composed Williamson swung the momentum back to New Zealand. He was unfazed when twice struck on the helmet by Brydon Carse and survived a vociferous appeal on 51 for caught behind when replays showed the ball hit the thigh-pad and not the bat. Williamson, who hit 10 fours, faced 197 deliveries in 274 minutes with temperatures hovering around 30 Celsius before being dismissed in the 90s for the first time in six years. In Williamson's previous 13 innings where he scored at least 90, the prolific batsman had gone on to register eight hundreds and five double centuries. With moisture in the ground causing the England bowlers some early problems with their delivery stride, Latham punished every loose ball that came along. But he had a lapse of concentration in the first over after the morning drinks break and he was caught behind off Carse for 47. Ravindra took on the aggressor role as he and Williamson added 68 for the third wicket before Ravindra clumsily mis-hit a loose full toss from Bashir and was gone for 34. Mitchell accompanied Williamson through to tea but went for 19 in the second over after play resumed. The wickets of Williamson, Tom Blundell (17) and debutant Nathan Smith (three) quickly followed as New Zealand slumped to 252-7. Henry added a brisk 18, leaving Phillips and Tim Southee (10) to see out the day. England debutant, 21-year-old Jacob Bethell, bowled one over of left-arm spin with his first Test delivery dispatched to the boundary by Williamson. Uncapped Durham wicketkeeper Ollie Robinson was on Thursday added to England's squad in place of the injured Jordan Cox and is expected to arrive on Saturday. Bethell will bat at number three with Ollie Pope taking the gloves in this Test and sliding down the order to six.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251433/williamson-falls-for-93-as-england-fight-back-in-first-test
Employees to stage demo at secretariat Wednesday demanding pay scale reforms,"The employees of Bangladesh Secretariat have announced of organising a demonstration inside the secretariat next Wednesday to press a nine-point demand, including pay scale adjustments, removal of inequalities and improved benefits. The decision was announced on Thursday during a rally organised by the secretariat officials and employees joint council led by its president Md Badiul Kabir. Announcing a general assembly next Wednesday, Kabir said, ‘We are protesting to achieve our demands. We urge to implement our demands without delay.’ The demands include the formation of a National Pay Commission, reducing the number of pay grades from 20 to 10, implementing a 50 percent dearness allowance before rolling out the full Pay Commission, upgrading the 20th-grade positions (office assistants) to the 17th grade and 10th grade to 9th grade. Their other demands are restoring the time-scale and selection grade system for all grades, introducing a 100 per cent pension gratuity scheme, exempting annual incomes up to Tk 5 lakh from tax, increasing the retirement age from 59 to 62 and offering Secretariat employees allowances similar to those at the President’s office and rationing facilities akin to the defense ministry. The rally also demanded the removal of a joint secretary accused of delays and misconduct in addressing their grievances. The council called for the cancellation of discriminatory orders imposed during the previous regime and the implementation of seniority-based promotions. The event was attended by the council’s secretary general Md Nizam Uddin Ahmed and presided over by Md Badiul Kabir.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251432/employees-to-stage-demo-at-secretariat-wednesday-demanding-pay-scale-reforms
Bomb threats target US President-elect Trump nominees,"Several members of Donald Trump’s incoming US administration have received threats, including bomb alerts, the FBI said Wednesday. The President-elect’s picks for UN ambassador and head of the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as his former choice to be US attorney general, said they were among those who had received the threats. ‘The FBI is aware of numerous bomb threats and swatting incidents targeting incoming administration nominees and appointees, and we are working with our law enforcement partners,’ the agency said in a statement. Swatting refers to a practice in which police are summoned urgently to someone’s house under false pretenses. Such hoax calls are common in the United States and have seen numerous senior political figures targeted in recent years. Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump’s transition team, said that several appointees and nominees ‘were targeted in violent, unAmerican threats to their lives and those who live with them.’ Outgoing President Joe Biden ‘has been briefed’ on the threats, the White House said. ‘The White House is in touch with federal law enforcement and the President-elect’s team, and continues to monitor the situation closely,’ a spokesperson said in a statement. ‘The president and the administration unequivocally condemn threats of political violence.’ Biden has vowed a smooth and peaceful presidential transition -- in contrast to when Trump riled a mob that attacked the US Capitol in January 2021 with false claims of election fraud. Elise Stefanik, a Trump loyalist congresswoman tapped to be UN ambassador, said her residence in New York was targeted in a bomb threat. She said in a statement that she, her husband, and small son were driving home from Washington for the Thanksgiving holiday when they learned of the threat. Lee Zeldin, Trump’s pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, said his home was targeted with a pipe bomb threat sent with a ‘pro-Palestinian themed message.’ The former congressman from New York said he and his family were not home at the time. Matt Gaetz, who dropped out as Trump’s pick to be attorney general after facing opposition over sexual misconduct allegations, reposted Zeldin’s message on X and said: ‘Same.’ Scott Turner, the nomine for Housing Secretary and a retired NFL player, and Trump’s pick for Labor Secretary, meanwhile also said they had also received bomb threats at their homes. Fox News Digital quoted unidentified sources saying that John Ratcliffe, Trump’s nominee to head the CIA, and Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary pick, were additionally targeted. Ahead of his return to the White House in January, Trump has already swiftly assembled a cabinet of loyalists, including several criticized for a severe lack of experience. The Republican, who appears set to avoid trial on criminal prosecutions related to attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss, was wounded in the ear in July in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally. The shooter was killed in counter-fire. In September, authorities arrested another man accused of planning to shoot at Trump while he played golf at his course in West Palm Beach, Florida. Leavitt appeared to reference the previous incidents, saying that ‘with President Trump as our example, dangerous acts of intimidation and violence will not deter us.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/north-america/251431/bomb-threats-target-us-president-elect-trump-nominees

Suspended Lalmonirhat assistant commissioner Urmi gets bail upon surrender,"A Dhaka court on Thursday granted bail to Taposhee Tabassum Urmi, a Lalmonirhat assistant commissioner who was suspended over comments about the government, in a defamation case. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Imran Ahmed passed the order after Urmi appeared and applied for bail, according to the court officials. Earlier on October 8, Abu Hanif, a senior council member and media coordinator of the People’s Rights Council, filed the defamation case against Urmi in the Dhaka court for making derogatory comments about the deceased, including Abu Sayeed during the quota reform student movement. Then a Dhaka court ordered her to appear in court on November 28 after reviewing the record. According to the complaint, on October 5, Urmi, on her Facebook page, wrote comments about the interim government chief, Professor Muhammad Yunus, and deceased people during the July-August movement that ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina on August 5. On October 5, Urmi wrote on Facebook that the interim government had no constitutional basis.

"Jatiya Nagorik Committee protests at deadly attack on Hasnat, Sarjis","Jatiya Nagorik Committee staged a protest on Wednesday night at Dhaka University’s Raju Sculpture, condemning the attempted murder of Anti-Discrimination Students Movement conveners Hasnat Abdullah and Sarjis Alam. The two were reportedly targeted in a deliberate truck run-over incident while returning from Chattogram on Wednesday. Students from various residential halls of Dhaka University joined the protest, extending solidarity against the attack. Akthar Hossen, the member secretary of the committee and former social service secretary of DUCSU, put forward four key demands during the demonstration. The demands are liberating Bangladeshi Hindu community members from the influence of extremist Hinduism, arresting and prosecuting those responsible for creating instability in the country, identifying and appropriately punishing individuals involved in the violation of Hindu human rights over the past 15 years, and implementing effective measures to ensure the security and dignity of minority communities. ‘There is a conspiracy against Bangladesh. Attempts are being made to create a division between Hindus and Muslims. But the people of Bangladesh have demonstrated that they will not fall into such traps. We, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Christians, and indigenous communities, are prepared to sacrifice our lives to protect our country,’ Akhtar said. Coordinator Abdul Hannan Masud also addressed the gathering, saying, ‘The conspirators believe that by targeting Hasnat and Sarjis, they can undermine Bangladesh’s sovereignty. But from secretaries to labourers, every citizen of this nation is a warrior. No one will accept Delhi’s dominance or any form of fascism. Everyone is ready to lay down their life for this land.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251427/jatiya-nagorik-committee-protests-at-deadly-attack-on-hasnat-sarjis

"HC declines intervention on ISKCON issue, hailed govt’s priority efforts","The High Court on Thursday declined to intervene in the ISKCON-related complaints, citing that the government assured of addressing the matter as a top priority. The bench of Justice Farah Mahbub and Justice Debasish Roy Chowdhury expressed satisfaction with the government’s response and instructed it to continue efforts to safeguard citizens’ lives and properties. The court had on Wednesday sought an update from attorney general Md Asaduzzaman on  measures taken regarding the killing of assistant public prosecutor Saiful Islam Alif. The High Court directive followed a plea by lawyer Md Monir Uddin, who appealed for judicial intervention to ensure justice for Alif. On Thursday, deputy attorney general Asad Uddin informed the court that three cases had been filed against 76 individuals in connection with the murder and the subsequent violence. So far, 33 suspects have been arrested, including six individuals identified from CCTV footage. ‘The investigation is ongoing, and more information is expected from the interrogation of the arrested suspects,’ said Asad. He also assured the court that law enforcement agencies remain vigilant to prevent further unrest. Attorney general Md Asaduzzaman later told reporters that banning ISKCON is a matter of government policy and beyond the jurisdiction of the High Court. ‘The lawyer’s plea is premature. The court must allow the government to act on this matter,’ he said, adding that the authorities are investigating ISKCON’s legal status and will take appropriate steps based on the findings. The High Court emphasised its expectation that the government would take all necessary measures to protect the lives and property of citizens, urging continued vigilance in addressing the situation, the AG said. The court also thanked Monir for drawing its attention to the ISKCON issue and expressing concern over the recent violence. Speaking to the journalists, Monir called for robust action, including the imposition of a 15-day state of emergency in Dinajpur, Rangpur, and Chattogram districts, and a ban on the International Society for Krishna Consciousness for their alleged involvement in the killing. He cited media reports as his information source and said that the tension escalated following a statement from India’s Ministry of External Affairs. Speaking to reporters, Monir said, ‘ISKCON activists killed my colleague, as reported in newspapers. If ISKCON is not banned, their actions will spiral out of control.’ He further claimed that tension between Muslims and Hindus could lead to broader communal violence if ISKCON’s activities were not contained. Alif was hacked to death during a violent clash on the Chattogram court premises on Tuesday. The violence erupted on Tuesday when followers of former ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, now a spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagaran Jote, clashed with law enforcement agencies. The confrontation occurred after a Chattogram metropolitan magistrate rejected Chinmoy’s bail plea and ordered his detention in a sedition case filed by a Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251425/hc-declines-intervention-on-iskcon-issue-hailed-govts-priority-efforts
CJ concerned over security breaches at courts,"Chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed on Thursday expressed deep concern over the recent security breaches at courts across Bangladesh, describing the incidents as ‘rare,’ ‘unprecedented,’ and ‘alarming.’ He emphasised the need for urgent measures to ensure the safety and security of judicial premises, judges, and court officials. On Wednesday, a group of lawyers disrupted a High Court session presided over by Justice Md Ashraful Kamal and Justice Kazi Waliul Islam, hurling eggs and shouting at the judges. The commotion forced the judges to leave the  courtroom, marking an unprecedented attack on judicial authority within the courtroom itself. In a separate incident on Tuesday, assistant public prosecutor Saiful Islam Alif was hacked to death during a violent clash on the Chattogram court premises. The violence erupted after a Chattogram metropolitan magistrate rejected the bail plea of Krishna Das Brahmachari Chinmoy, a former leader of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), and ordered his detention. The Supreme Court issued a notification on Thursday, assuring that measures were being taken to maintain normalcy and ensure uninterrupted judicial services. Registrar general Aziz Ahmed Bhuiyan stated that Chief Justice Ahmed had directed all courts to take steps to prevent further disruptions and ensure security at judicial premises nationwide. ‘The judiciary is one of the three main organs of the state, and its independence must be safeguarded to ensure the rule of law,’ the notification said. The chief justice called for immediate and comprehensive measures to protect court premises and courtrooms, judges’ residences and transport, court employees and related personnel. Law enforcement agencies have been instructed to enhance security at all courts and tribunals. The chief justice underscored the importance of creating a safe environment for justice seekers, emphasising that such incidents harm public confidence in the judiciary. The Chief Justice convened a meeting with attorney general Md Asaduzzaman, leaders of the Supreme Court Bar Association, and senior lawyers. He sought their cooperation in strengthening security measures and ensuring that judicial functions remain unaffected. ‘The recent incidents are a wake-up call for urgent action to uphold the rule of law and maintain the integrity of the judiciary,’ said a senior Supreme Court official. The chief justice reiterated his commitment to protect the judiciary’s image and ensuring that justice is delivered without fear or obstruction. Supreme Court Bar Association president AM Mahbub Uddin Khokon later informed journalists that the disruption in the High Court was connected to the ongoing ISKCON-related clashes at the Chattogram court premises. He assured that the bar association would launch an investigation into the High Court incident and take disciplinary action against any lawyers found involved in the disruption. ‘This incident is deeply concerning, and we are committed to holding those responsible accountable,’ Khokon stated.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251424/cj-concerned-over-security-breaches-at-courts

Dhaka becomes 7th most polluted city with AQI score of 158,"Dhaka, the overcrowded capital city of Bangladesh, has ranked 7th on the list of cities with the worst air quality with an AQI score of 158 at 8:30am on Thursday morning. Today’s air was classified as ‘unhealthy’, according to the AQI index. When the AQI value for particle pollution is between 50 and 100, air quality is considered ‘moderate’, usually sensitive individuals should consider limiting prolonged outdoor exertion, between 101 and 150, air quality is considered ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’, between 150 and 200 is ‘unhealthy’, between 201 and 300 is said to be ‘very unhealthy’, while a reading of 301 and above is considered ‘hazardous’, posing serious health risks to residents. Pakistan’s Lahore, India’s Delhi and North Macedonia’s Skopje took the first, second and third spots in the list, with AQI scores of 415, 362 and 172 respectively. The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. The AQI in Bangladesh is based on five pollutants — particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon. As per World Health Organisation, air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, mainly due to increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251422/dhaka-becomes-7th-most-polluted-city-with-aqi-score-of-158
Dortmund beat Zagreb to climb into Champions League top four,"Goals from Jamie Gittens, Ramy Bensebaini and Serhou Guirassy took Borussia Dortmund to a 3-0 win at Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League on Wednesday. English winger Gittens opened the scoring with a stunning long-range solo effort before half-time, shooting in from the edge of the box. Bensebaini headed in a Pascal Gross corner early in the second half and Guirassy came off the bench to add a third late, sealing the result. The win, Dortmund's first away victory in any competition since September, sent them into the top four and all but sealed at least a spot in the knockout rounds. One concern for Dortmund coach Nuri Sahin will be Julian Brandt's fitness ahead of Saturday's game against Bayern Munich. The midfielder, captaining the side with Emre Can on the bench, was subbed out after limping off before half-time with a reported thigh injury. Zagreb had rebounded in the Champions League after an opening round 9-2 thrashing at the hands of Dortmund's German rivals Bayern, winning two and drawing another to climb into the knockout placings. The home fans welcomed last season's Champions League finalists with loud fireworks in a stadium still showing scars of a 2020 earthquake, with its capacity reduced by 14,000 due to fears of collapse. The visitors, on a run of six straight away losses in all competitions, took a while to get started, Zagreb's Ronael Pierre-Gabriel blasting just over the bar on the counter startling Dortmund into life. Donyell Malen hit the crossbar after 28 minutes. Gittens found Malen unmarked and one-on-one with the goalkeeper on the 41-minute mark but the Dutchman headed wide. Seconds later, Gittens took matters into his own hands, dribbling past three defenders to give himself space before unleashing a superb dipping rocket into the top right corner. Still just 20, the goal was Gittens' fourth in his fifth Champions League game this campaign. Gross found Bensebaini from a corner just after half-time for Dortmund's second, the Algerian standing tall and heading past the Zagreb keeper. With one eye on Saturday's clash with Bayern, Sahin made three changes with half an hour remaining, including bringing on Guirassy as he returned from illness. The Guinean showed excellent touch to seal the match with a goal in the final minute, to match Gittens' tally of four in five Champions League games. Dortmund have now won four of five outings in the Champions League, other than their 5-2 humbling in the Champions League final rematch against Real Madrid in October.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/251421/dortmund-beat-zagreb-to-climb-into-champions-league-top-four
Villa denied late winner against Juventus,"Emiliano Martinez produced a wonder save and Aston Villa were controversially denied a last-gasp winner as they played out a 0-0 draw with Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday. Chances were at a premium in Birmingham but the home side had Argentina international Martinez to thank for keeping the scores level. Unai Emery's Villa raced out of the blocks in Europe this season, winning their first three matches, but they have now failed to any of their past seven games in all competitions. Emery made it clear before the match that a draw would not be a bad result against the Italian giants as he plots an exit from the revamped group stage. Juventus, playing without a recognised striker, enjoyed the bulk of possession in the early stages but showed little punch against the home side. The game opened up as the first half progressed. Teenager Kenan Yildiz drifted in from the left but dragged his shot wide of Martinez's right-hand post in the 20th minute. The first shot on target for either side came when Ollie Watkins controlled a clever Boubacar Kamara pass in the 37th minute but Juventus goalkeeper Michele di Gregorio pushed the ball behind. Matty Cash lashed a shot towards goal from the resulting corner but it hit a Juventus player and the Italians broke with pace, Timothy Weah, playing up front, firing over from distance. Martinez then kept out a shot from the impressive Francisco Conceicao. But Villa came closest to breaking the deadlock in first-half stoppage time when Lucas Digne rattled the crossbar from a free-kick. Both teams showed more urgency early in the second half as the game picked up pace, with the home crowd trying to lift Villa. Two-time champions Juventus had a glorious chance to take the lead in the 65th minute when the ball fell to Conceicao at the back post from a corner. He got his effort on target but somehow Martinez made up ground to his right, diving low to keep the ball out, millimetres short of crossing the line. Five minutes later Villa were denied when Bailey crossed for John McGinn, whose shot was kept out by the outstretched boot of Manuel Locatelli. Villa thought they had won the match in the final seconds when Morgan Rogers hooked in from close range after a Youri Tielemans free-kick. But the officials ruled there had been a foul on the goalkeeper. Villa, playing their first season in the Europe's top-tier competition since the 1982/83 season, started their campaign with three wins, including a memorable 1-0 triumph against Bayern Munich before defeat at Club Brugge. Juventus now have two wins, two draws and a defeat.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/251420/villa-denied-late-winner-against-juventus
Mbappe misses penalty as Liverpool exact revenge on Madrid,"Kylian Mbappe saw a penalty saved as Liverpool beat Real Madrid 2-0 on Wednesday to inflict a third Champions League defeat in five matches on the holders. Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo scored the goals in the second half as the Reds maintained their perfect record to return to the top of the table. Mohamed Salah also fired wide from the spot, but it mattered little as Liverpool secured a 17th win in Arne Slot's first 19 games in charge. Slot has already achieved what Jurgen Klopp could not as Liverpool boss by slaying the Spanish giants. Liverpool had a score to settle with Madrid, who were unbeaten in eight previous meetings between the sides, including Champions League finals against Klopp's men in 2018 and 2022. Defeat sends Carlo Ancelotti's side tumbling down to 24th in the table. Only the top 24 progress to the knockout stage with the top eight advancing directly to the last 16. Liverpool are well on course to do just that and the confidence coursing through a side also eight points clear at the top of the Premier League was in evidence throughout in front of a highly-charged Anfield crowd. Madrid were hamstrung by a lengthy injury list and made the trip to England without Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, Aurelien Tchouameni and David Alaba. Young centre-back Raul Asencio has been pressed into action by those absences and he made a vital goal-line clearance on four minutes. Darwin Nunez was sent in behind the Madrid defence by Salah and after his shot produced a fine save from Thibaut Courtois, Asencio reacted smartly to prevent the rebound bouncing off him and into his own net. Courtois was Liverpool's scourge with a man-of-the-match performance in the final two years ago as Madrid prevailed 1-0 in Paris. The Belgian was at his best again as he blocked another big Nunez chance from point-blank range as the Liverpool pressure built without reward before the break. Courtois was in sparkling form again at the start of the second period to parry Conor Bradley's downward header. But Liverpool were not to be denied as Bradley was this time the provider for Mac Allister, who manufactured the space for a shot into the far corner on 52 minutes. The visitors were relying on Mbappe for a moment of magic in the absence of Vinicius, but the Frenchman was well-marshalled by his international team-mate Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk. His chance to silence his critics arrived on the hour mark when Andy Robertson was harshly adjudged to have tripped Lucas Vazquez inside the area. Caoimhin Kelleher has excelled in the absence of the injured Alisson Becker and leapt to his left to save Mbappe's spot-kick. Salah sparked a furore ahead of the game by declaring his disappointment with Liverpool's failure to offer him a contract renewal. The Egyptian has been in sparkling form this season and his pace and trickery fooled Ferland Mendy into a mistimed challenge. Salah, though, gave Madrid a lifeline by firing his penalty off the outside of the post. Liverpool had to wait just six more minutes for the cushion of a second goal as substitute Gakpo rose highest from a corner to power a header past Courtois.

Decision on cluster-based univ admission test delayed,"The government on Wednesday has sought some more time to the public universities to take a final decision on continuing or scrapping the cluster-based admission test system. The system’s feasibility has been questioned again recently after three universities decided to leave the system citing different problems including not getting meritorious students and session congestion. The three universities are Jagannath University, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh and Khulna University of Engineering and Technology. Against this backdrop, the education ministry’s special assistant professor M Aminul Islam on Wednesday held a meeting with the vice-chancellors of the public universities combined under the system. Bangladesh Agricultural University vice-chancellor professor AK Fazlul Haque Bhuiyan told New Age that, at the meeting, decision was made that the government would review the cluster-based admission system before taking a final decision on it. Seven agricultural universities held admission tests under the cluster system for the first time in the 2019–20 academic year with an aim to reduce the sufferings of the admission seekers. In the 2020-21 and 2021-22 sessions, the universities in three clusters — general and, science and technology universities, agricultural universities, and engineering universities held admission tests under the cluster system. Since the introduction, some public universities did not want to work under this system citing difficulties in admission procedure. Five major public universities — Dhaka University, Chittagong University, Rajshahi University, Jahangirnagar University and the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology — decided not to join the system. Most recently, the authorities of Jagannath University issued an advertisement to take separate admission test for this year. Professor Md Rezaul Karim, vice-chancellor of the university, said that the decision of leaving the cluster-based system was taken at an academic council meeting. Bangladesh Agricultural University vice chancellor professor AK Fazlul Haque Bhuiyan also said that the decision of leaving the system was taken at the university’s academic council. ‘We do not want to be in the system as we are facing many challenges,’ he said. He said that due to the system they could not select the meritorious students as per their requirement which was hampering the university’s reputation. Professor Fazlul Haque said that most of the vice-chancellors also said the same. In the meeting, professor Aminul Islam sought seven to 10 days to the vice-chancellors to review the cluster-based system and get a final decision from higher level of the government, he added. According to the University Grants Commission, 24 general and science and technology universities, eight agricultural universities, and three engineering universities are scheduled to conduct admission tests this year. In the country currently there are 55 public universities. Earlier on February 27, 2023 at an education ministry meeting, decision was reached to administer unified admission tests for all public universities in 2023–24 academic session, while it was also decided that the proposed National Testing Authority will prepare a national score. Neither the unified admission test was held nor has the NTA been formed yet.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251418/decision-on-cluster-based-univ-admission-test-delayed

Women’s role in mass uprising to be preserved: adviser,"Women and children affairs ministry adviser Sharmeen S Murshid in Dhaka on Wednesday said that steps would be taken to highlight and preserve women’s contributions to the July-August student-led mass uprising through stories, publications, and events. She made the remark at a press conference held in the conference room of Bangladesh Shishu Academy, marking the observance of the 16-day International Campaign to End Violence against Women 2024. ‘The stories of women during the mass uprising have not been highlighted adequately compared to those of men. Efforts will be made to preserve these stories,’ she said in response to a question. The Ministry of Women and Children Affairs has launched several activities as part of the 16-day campaign programme aimed at raising public awareness against violence towards women and girls and fostering positive policy and social changes. The activities include organising dialogues, workshops, and seminars on gender-based violence, raising awareness at all levels through art exhibitions, street theatre, and cultural programmes, taking a collective oath at educational institutions and sending messages to the citizens of the country through all mobile operators regarding the prevention of violence against women and children. In response to a question about counselling for women victims of gender-based violence, senior secretary of the ministry, Mamtaz Ahmed, said that some initiatives for counselling victims of such violence are available on a limited scale, both online and offline. The ministry has been working towards establishing counselling services at the upazila-level, added Mamtaz Ahmed. Director general of the Department of Women Affairs, Keya Khan, and Shishu Academy director general, Tania Khan, were also present at the event.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251416/womens-role-in-mass-uprising-to-be-preserved-adviser
"Ensure safety, security of journalists, women rights defenders: workshop","Speakers at a workshop in Dhaka on Wednesday urged the government to ensure digital safety and security for journalists and women human rights defenders. They made the urge at the workshop titled Digital Safety and Security: Perspectives of Journalists and Women Human Rights Defenders at SETU Training Centre in Mohammadpur. Organised by rights and advocacy organisation Voices for Interactive Choice and Empowerment, journalists and women human rights defenders participated the workshop. Emphasising the importance of using encrypted communication tools for emails and messaging, Ashraful Haque, a digital safety and security specialist from EngageMedia, highlighted, ‘These tools are crucial for journalists and rights activists to safeguard their sources and sensitive communications from hacking and surveillance.’ Rezwan Islam, a communications expert from EngageMedia, stated, ‘The rapid growth of online platforms has made it easier for perpetrators to target journalists and women human rights defenders with various forms of harassment, including threats, doxxing, trolling, and misinformation campaigns.’ Ahmed Swapan Mahmud, executive director of VOICE, emphasised, ‘In today’s digital age, ensuring digital safety and security is crucial, particularly for journalists and women human rights defenders.’ ‘Their work often involves sensitive investigations, explorations, and communications, making them vulnerable to threats such as surveillance, exploitation, and hacking,’ he added. Musharrat Mahera, deputy director of VOICE, outlined the workshop’s objectives during her presentation. She highlighted, ‘Women journalists and defenders face a multitude of challenges, which have intensified with the rise of social media and online communication, often discouraging them from pursuing critical reporting or voicing their opinions on significant issues.’ The interactive nature of the workshop enhanced participants' confidence in navigating the digital landscape, equipping them with the knowledge and tools to safeguard themselves and their information sources effectively. VOICE has long been working with journalists and women human rights defenders and has expressed deep concern over the significant challenges they face in carrying out their professional responsibilities. Particular attention has been drawn to the safety of women in these fields, who are frequently targeted with online harassment, including cyberbullying, lawsuits, arrests, and detentions, especially during periods of authoritarian governance.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251415/ensure-safety-security-of-journalists-women-rights-defenders-workshop
"Citizens for inclusive constitution, limiting power of PM","Citizens sharing their opinion on the reform of the constitution recommended that the national constitution endorse multi-ethnicity of society, ensuring liberty of lawmakers and the judiciary and limiting power of the prime minister. Talking to the Constitutional Reform Commission on Wednesday at the commission office on Jatiya Sangsad premises, they also recommended simplicity of the constitution, recognition of all mother tongues besides Bangla and gender diversity. According to the commission, 26 persons representing nine organisations provided the commission with their opinions. Professor Mirza Taslima Sultana and professor Kazi Maruful Islam, representing the University Teachers Network Bangladesh, recommended recognition of all national minority groups with Bangladeshi nationality, equal importance of all mother tongues and secularism. They suggested bicameralism for the parliamentary system and said that the Bangla translation of peoples’ republic could be ‘janaganatantra’. Roman Uddin, on behalf of Centre for Governance Studies, recommended that the national constitution should uphold the spirit of the War of Independence of 1971 and the 2024 student-led mass uprising. He also suggested that the constitution must be written in standard colloquial language instead of chaste formal language and an amendment to the Article 70 to allow crossing the floor unless it was a vote of no-confidence against one’s own party or affecting the national security. Other recommendations included four-year tenure of a government, reintroduction of posts of vice-president and deputy prime minister, freedom of the judiciary, the provision for re-election if there are less than 51 per cent votes at a polling station.

HC grants bail to ex-SP Babul Akhter,"The High Court on Wednesday granted ad interim bail to former police super Babul Akhter in Mahmuda Khan Mitu murder case. A High Court bench comprising Justice Md Atowar Rahman and Justice Ali Reza granted the bail petition moved by advocate Mohammad Shishier Manir. Advocate Manir told the journalists that after the bail order, there is no legal bar in releasing Babul Akhter from the jail. The lawyer said that the court granted the ad-interim bail of Babul Akhter considering his detention in the jail for three years and seven months and issued a rule asking to know why he would not be given permanent bail in the case. There was no prosecution witness in the trial court in connection with the case since July 1 last. Those who gave depositions as prosecution witnesses in this case, have already applied to withdraw their statements, he said adding that they also told the court that they were forced to give the depositions before the court in fear of the then chief of Police Bureau of Investigation Banaz Kumar Majumder. Advocate Shishier Manir said that Babul Akhter was in Dhaka on the day of the killing of Mitu and he was sent to Chattogram by a helicopter on an emergency basis. Besides, the prosecution is still unaware about the whereabouts of Musa, one of the prime accused, the Lawyer added. Babul Akhter earlier moved a bail petition before the court of Third Additional District Judge, Chattogram but the court on August 18 rejected the bail petition. As a result, Babul Akhter moved the bail petition before the High Court. Mahmuda Akhter Mitu, wife of Babul Akhter, was stabbed and shot dead by unidentified miscreants at O R Nizam Road in Chattogram city in the morning of June 5 in 2016 on way to her son’s school. Later, Babul Akhter filed a murder case with Panchlaish police station in this connection. The PBI took up the charge of the investigation into the case and they found the involvement of Babul Akhter in the killing of his wife. Subsequently, the PBI submitted a final report of the case filed by Babul Akhter and Mitu’s father Mosharaf Hossain, also a former police inspector, lodged a case accusing Babul Akhter as the prime accused of the murder. The PBI arrested Babul Akhter and sent him to jail through court. Meanwhile, lawyer of Babul Akhter on October 14 in that year submitted a non acceptance (Na-razi) petition to the court against the final report of PBI. Following the petition, the court ordered for further investigation into the case rejecting the final report and non-acceptance petition. But, both the cases were investigated by the PBI and following a court order police gave final report to the case final by the father of Mitu on January 25, 2022. The PBI on September 13, 2022 submitted charge sheet of the case accusing seven persons including Babul Akhter. The Third Additional District and Sessions Judge Court on March 13 last year framed charges against seven persons, including Babul Akhter and started the trial of the case.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251413/hc-grants-bail-to-ex-sp-babul-akhter
Kumara gives Sri Lanka edge on rain-hit day against South Africa,"Lahiru Kumara struck twice as Sri Lanka's bowlers had the better of a rain-hit opening day of the first Test against South Africa at Kingsmead on Wednesday. South Africa were 80 for four when rain stopped play for the day shortly before lunch. Fast bowler Kumara took wickets in successive overs to put his team on top –- and was denied a third wicket because of a no-ball. ‘There was a lot in favour of the bowling team and they bowled well. The deliveries that got wickets were all pretty decent,’ said South Africa batting coach Ashwell Prince. ‘It's a skilled bowling line-up and obviously they have done their homework.’ Sri Lankan bowling coach Darshana Gamage said pace was Kumara's biggest asset. With a history of hamstring injuries, he is now being used as a Test specialist. ‘In this Test championship, we wanted to have all our bowlers fresh,’ said Gamage. ‘Our biggest challenge is to have quicks who will win us Test matches and I can say that we have the nucleus now to do the job away from home.’ Sri Lanka's decision to bowl first on a well-grassed pitch paid off under a heavily overcast sky. Namesakes Ajitha and Vishwa Fernando dismissed both South Africa's openers with the total on 14. Ajitha Fernando had Aiden Markram caught at first slip and the left-armed Vishwa had the left-handed Tony de Zorzi caught at second slip in what were virtual mirror-image dismissals, with the ball swinging away from the batsmen. Tristan Stubbs and South African captain Temba Bavuma defended doggedly, taking the total to 29 after 13 overs. There was a flurry of scoring when Kumara came into the attack in the 14th over, with 17 runs added off his first over –- four leg-byes, a no-ball and three boundaries by Stubbs. But the strongly-built Kumara found extra bounce with the first ball of his second over, having Stubbs caught at third slip for 16. David Bedingham hit a boundary but was then beaten for pace by a ball which sent his off stump flying. Kumara celebrated a third wicket when Bavuma, on 20, gloved an attempted hook at Kumara's first short-pitched delivery of the innings to be caught behind by wicketkeeper Kusal Mendis. But a check by the third umpire showed that Kumara had over-stepped. Bavuma, who was dropped at third slip by Dimuth Karunaratne off Vishwa Fernando when he was on one, was unbeaten on 28 when rain drove the players off the field. The weather is expected to clear from Thursday and Prince said South Africa were in a reasonable position, referring to the first Test between Australia and India in Perth last weekend when two low first innings totals were followed by a strong Indian second-innings performance. ‘Last week's Test in Australia was a good example of how when conditions change, things can change for the batting team. When the sun came out the pitch changed colour and conditions changed dramatically. We're hoping for a bit of sunshine tomorrow morning.’ The two-Test series is crucial to both sides' hopes of reaching next year's World Test Championship final at Lord's, with Sri Lanka sitting third in the table and South Africa fifth.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251412/kumara-gives-sri-lanka-edge-on-rain-hit-day-against-south-africa
Khaleda Zia applies for US visa,"Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson Khaleda Zia on Wednesday provided her biometric data to the United States embassy in Dhaka as she applied for a US visa. Khaleda’s personal physician and BNP standing committee member AZM Zahid Hossain said that the former prime minister may have to go to the US for advanced treatment. ‘That is why she went to the American embassy to provide her biometric fingerprints,’ he said. He said that embassy officials including the acting ambassador welcomed her at the embassy. Khaleda, 79, has been suffering from various diseases and doctors advised her to go to a ‘multidisciplinary medical centre’ in a developed country for better treatment. On February 8, 2018, Khaleda was sentenced to five years in prison in the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case. In October, 2014, the sentence was increased to 10 years after an appeal hearing in the High Court. Then, she was sentenced to another seven years in the Zia Charitable Trust corruption case. The then prime minister Sheikh Hasina exercised her executive power in 2020 suspended Khaleda’s sentence for six months. After being temporarily released on March 25 of that year, Khaleda returned to her Gulshan residence, Firoza. She has been there since then. The day after the fall of Sheikh Hasina on August 5, president Muhammed Shahabuddin commuted the sentence of Khaleda Zia under the power of Article 49 of the Constitution. Since then, Hasina’s government has been extending the BNP leader’s release period every six months on the request of her family. Every time, she was given two conditions. She would have to receive treatment at home and she would not be able to go abroad. Although the family had made several requests to send her abroad, Sheikh Hasina’s government repeatedly rejected them citing those conditions. The day after the fall of Sheikh Hasina on August 5, president Muhammed Shahabuddin commuted the sentence of Khaleda Zia under the power of Article 49 of the Constitution. Then on October 30, Zahid Hossain said that it had been decided to take Khaleda Zia abroad for treatment. First, she would go to London to see her son Tarique Rahman. She would be taken there in a specialised air ambulance. Later, she would be taken from London to another country and admitted to a ‘multidisciplinary medical centre’.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/251411/khaleda-zia-applies-for-us-visa
Man stabs sister to death,"A man allegedly stabbed his sister to death and injured his brother in their house due to dispute over properties in Dhaka’s Khilgaon area on Wednesday. The deceased is Rumi Akhter, 35. Her brother Md Babul, 55, was receiving treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Their brother Abdus Salam, 43, reportedly carried out the attack, according to police. Khilgaon police station officer-in-charge Daud Hossain said that police arrested Abdus Salam for his alleged involvement in the incident that occurred at about 4:00pm on Wednesday in West Nabinbagh Garments Lane in Khilgaon. ‘There was a long-standing dispute over properties among the siblings. Rumi was critically injured after Salam stabbed her in the stomach with a pair of sharp scissors,’ he said. Rumi later was taken to the DMCH, where she succumbed to her injuries, he said, adding that Salam was taken into custody. Rumi’s sister-in-law Shirin Begum said that a quarrel erupted between Salam and his wife about Salam taking illegal drugs. ‘He suddenly grabbed a sharp pair of scissors and attacked Babul.

Thousands in Lebanon head home as Israel-Hezbollah truce takes hold,"Tens of thousands of Lebanese displaced by the war between Israel and Hezbollah headed back to their devastated towns and villages as a ceasefire took hold on Wednesday. Under the terms of the deal that brought the war to a halt, the Lebanese military started reinforcing its presence in the country’s south, where Hezbollah has long held sway. The war escalated after nearly a year of cross-border fire initiated by the militant group in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas, whose attack on Israel in October last year sparked the war in Gaza. It killed thousands of people in Lebanon and triggered mass displacement on both sides of the border. Israel shifted its focus from Gaza to Lebanon in September to secure its northern border from Hezbollah attacks and dealt the movement a series of heavy blows. The Iran-backed group has emerged from the war significantly weakened and still mourning the killing in an Israeli air raid of its long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah. Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah said on Wednesday that his group was cooperating on the Lebanese army’s deployment in south Lebanon. There is ‘full cooperation’ with the Lebanese state in strengthening the army’s deployment, he said, adding that the group has ‘no visible weapons or bases’ there and that ‘nobody can make residents leave their villages’. The road from the Lebanese capital to the south has been congested since the early hours, with thousands of people heading home. AFP journalists saw cars and minibuses packed with people carrying mattresses, suitcases and blankets, with some honking their horns and singing in celebration, with Hezbollah supporters declaring the truce a victory. ‘What we feel is indescribable,’ said one Lebanese driver on the road to the south. ‘The people have won!’ Others, however, voiced quiet desolation. Returning to his home in the southern town of Nabatiyeh, Ali Mazraani said he was shocked by the extent of the devastation from the raids. ‘Is this really Nabatiyeh?’ he said. ‘All our memories of Nabatiyeh have disappeared, and we can’t recognise our own town.’ In Lebanon, more than 9,00,000 people fled their homes in recent weeks, according to the UN, as Israel pounded the country, focusing in particular on areas where Hezbollah holds sway. Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri called on the displaced to go back to their homes despite the devastation. ‘I invite you to return to your homes return to your land,’ said Berri, who led mediation efforts on behalf of his allies in Hezbollah. Prime minister Najib Mikati urged Israel to respect the terms of the truce and said Lebanon was turning the page on ‘one of the most painful phases that the Lebanese have lived in their modern history’. Lebanon says at least 3,823 people were killed in the country since exchanges of fire across the border began in October 2023, most of them in recent weeks. On the Israeli side, the hostilities with Hezbollah have killed at least 82 soldiers and 47 civilians, authorities there say. The final hours before the truce took hold at 4:00am (0200 GMT) on Wednesday were among the most violent particularly for Beirut, with Israeli strikes hitting areas including the busy commercial district of Hamra. Hezbollah, too, continued to claim attacks on Israel all the way up to the start of the truce. The Israeli and Lebanese militaries have both called on residents of frontline Lebanese villages to avoid returning home immediately. Hezbollah-backer Iran welcomed the end of what it called Israel’s aggression in Lebanon, while Hamas said it was ready for a truce in Gaza. The truce in Lebanon, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, would permit Israel to redirect its efforts back to Gaza, where it has been at war with Hamas since October of last year. ‘When Hezbollah is out of the picture, Hamas is left alone in the fight. Our pressure on it will intensify,’ Netanyahu said, adding that Israel would also focus on ‘the Iranian threat’. Iran is the main backer of both Hezbollah and Hamas and has fired two barrages of missiles and drones at Israel since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, in response to attacks attributed to Israel. US president Joe Biden announced the ceasefire agreement on Tuesday. Under the deal, Israeli forces will hold their positions but ‘a 60-day period will commence in which the Lebanese military and security forces will begin their deployment towards the south’, a US official said. Then Israel will begin a phased withdrawal without a vacuum forming that Hezbollah or others could rush into, the official said. The United States is Israel’s key ally and military backer, and Biden hailed the deal as ‘good news’ and a ‘new start’ for Lebanon. He said that the United States, with the support of France and other allies, would help to ensure the deal is implemented. Netanyahu thanked Biden for his involvement in brokering the deal, under whose terms Israel will maintain freedom to act against Hezbollah should it pose any new threat. On Wednesday, an AFP journalist saw Lebanese troops and vehicles deploying in two areas of south Lebanon. ‘The army has begun reinforcing its presence in the South Litani sector and extending the state’s authority in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon,’ the military said in a statement, referring to areas south of the Litani River in southern Lebanon. While the mood in Lebanon was of joy tempered by devastating loss, in Israel there was no indication of a return en masse of the 60,000 people forced to flee their homes by Hezbollah’s fire.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/251409/thousands-in-lebanon-head-home-as-israel-hezbollah-truce-takes-hold
Dozens of underage migrants rescued in Mediterranean,"Rescue ship Ocean Viking on Tuesday pulled 48 mostly underage migrants from the Mediterranean off the Libyan, the aid group that operates the vessel said on Wednesday. The group packed into an overloaded small boat was made up of ‘90 per cent unaccompanied minors’, Marseille-based SOS Mediterranee said in a statement. Ocean Viking had intervened after receiving a notification about the boat from a NATO aircraft by VHF radio, it added. ‘Most of the survivors are originally from The Gambia and Guinea-Bissau,’ according to SOS Mediterranee, which added that they were ‘now safe and resting in the on-board shelters’. Guinea-Bisseau on Africa’s western coast is one of the world’s poorest countries, seen also as one of the most plagued by corruption. The aid group complained at Italian authorities’ issuance of an authorisation for Ocean Viking to dock for the people to disembark at the distant port of Ravenna — almost 1,600 kilometres or a four days’ sail away. ‘This practice empties the Mediterranean of search and rescue resources and increases the suffering of rescued people,’ SOS Mediterranee said. Around 1,985 people attempting to reach Europe across the Mediterranean have gone missing or died this year, according to International Organisation for Migration figures.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/251408/dozens-of-underage-migrants-rescued-in-mediterranean
"1,000 Pakistan protesters arrested in Imran Khan capital march","Pakistan police said on Wednesday that they had arrested nearly 1,000 protesters who marched on the capital demanding the release of jailed ex-prime minister Imran Khan, after crowds were evicted from the city centre in a sweeping security crackdown. Khan has been jailed since August 2023, side-lined by dozens of legal cases he claims were confected to prevent his comeback in elections this year marred by rigging allegations. Since the February vote, his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party has defied a government crackdown with regular rallies, but Tuesday’s gathering was by far the largest to grip the capital since the poll. More than 10,000 protesters surged into the city on the weekend, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back. The government said at least one police officer was slain in unrest on Monday, while four state paramilitary personnel were also reported killed when protesters ran them over in a vehicle on Tuesday. The crowds aimed to occupy a public square outside parliament and the prime minister’s house. Overnight, security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters wielding sticks and slingshots, as roadblocks were set ablaze. By early Wednesday, AFP staff saw the main thoroughfare towards Islamabad’s government enclave cleared of crowds, and security forces in riot gear being bussed away from the area. Islamabad Police Inspector General Ali Nasir Rizvi said 954 protesters had been arrested between Sunday and Tuesday, when the crowds came within one mile of the government enclave. ‘610 of those arrests were made only on Tuesday alone,’ he said. Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement that security forces had ‘bravely repulsed the protesters’. Khan had issued a call from his cell outside Islamabad on Tuesday evening, telling more people to join the crowds. ‘All Pakistanis participating in the protest must remain peaceful, stay united, and stand firm until our demands are met,’ he said in a social media statement released by his party, who often meet him in jail. Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif called the protests ‘extremism’. Since Sunday, his ministers held regular press conferences in central Islamabad vowing no mercy for the oncoming marchers. But as they retreated from the capital, there were growing calls for reconciliation to prevent future flare-ups impacting regular citizens in the country of 240 million. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said in a statement that Khan and Sharif’s parties should ‘immediately enter a purposeful political dialogue’. ‘It is high time that they agree on a peaceful way forward instead of whipping up the emotions of their respective political workers and bringing the country to a standstill,’ the organisation said. Michael Kugelman, South Asia Institute director at The Wilson Centre, said on social media platform X that ‘Pakistan’s protests had no winners’. Anger towards the establishment has increased over the crackdown, he said, while at the same time, PTI was forced to retreat. ‘Pakistan on the whole is burdened by a worsening confrontation,’ he said. Khan, a charismatic 72-year-old former cricket star, served as premier from 2018 to 2022 and is the lodestar of PTI. But in his absence, the protests were led partially by his wife, Bushra Bibi, who was also jailed this year but released last month. Sharif’s government has come under increasing criticism for deploying heavy-handed measures to quash PTI rallies. Mobile internet was cut across Islamabad, schools shut on Monday remained closed Wednesday, and roadblocks prevented thousands of workers from reaching their jobs. Amnesty International said that ‘as protesters enter the capital, law enforcement officials have used unlawful and excessive force’. Khan was ousted by a no-confidence vote after falling out with the kingmaking military establishment, which analysts say engineers the rise and fall of Pakistan’s politicians. But as opposition leader, he led an unprecedented campaign of defiance, with street protests boiling over into unrest that the government cited as the reason for its crackdown. PTI won more seats than any other party in this year’s election, but a coalition of parties considered more pliable to military influence shut them out of power.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/251407/1000-pakistan-protesters-arrested-in-imran-khan-capital-march

RMG workers to get TCB subsidised food items,"The government has asked the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh to include about 10 lakh readymade garments workers in its subsidised food items distribution programme to one crore card holders. A meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs presided over by finance adviser Salehuddin Ahmed at secretariat took the decision on Wednesday while reviewing a proposal by the commerce ministry. The finance adviser told reporters that inclusion of the RMG workers in the ongoing TCB programme was possible since the issuance of one crore cards was yet to be completed. Under the Smart Family Card programme, the TCB has been selling rice, edible oils, lentil and sugar at subsidised rates to low-income groups against the backdrop of high inflation prevailing over the past two years. The adviser said that more groups would be included in the programme. The RMG workers of the apparel hubs at Tongi, Gazipur, Narayanganj, Ashulia and Savar will be brought under the programme by the TCB soon, said officials attending the meeting. The officials said that the inclusion of RMG workers would cost the government about Tk 31 crore monthly. The finance adviser also presided over a meeting of the cabinet committee on government purchase and approved separate proposals to procure some 55 lakh litres of soya bean oil, 60,000 tonnes of fertiliser and 50,000 tonnes of wheat. The committee also approved separate proposals to procure 20,000 tonnes of sugar and 20,000 tonnes of lentil. The finance adviser said that they preferred procuring essential food items. Answering to a question regarding volatility in prices of essential food items, the finance adviser said that the consumers were getting the comfort because of increased market monitoring. The approvals from the cabinet committee on government purchase, the TCB will procure 55 lakh litres of soya bean oil to be supplied by Basundhara Multi Food Products with per litre costing Tk 166. Meghna Sugar Refinery Ltd will supply sugar to TCB-- 10,000 tonnes each in two lots with per kilogramme costing Tk 116.85 and 115.85 respectively. Nabil Naba Foods Ltd will supply lentil to TCB-- 10,000 tonnes each in two lots with per kilogramme costing Tk 97.22 and Tk 97.97 respectively. M/S Agrocorp International Pte Ltd will supply the wheat to the food ministry with per tonne costing $286.08. The Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation will purchase 30,000 tonnes of urea fertiliser from Karnaphuli Fertiliser Company with per tonne costing $335.62 and the same amount of urea from SABIC Agri-nutrients Company of Saudi Arabia with each tonne costing $346.75. The finance adviser said that they approved purchase of 15 lakh booklets and 15 lakh lamination foils at Tk 61.20 crore from HID CID Limited of England to meet the shortage of passport books badly needed by expatriate Bangladeshis for renewal of passports. The adviser said that approval was also given to purchase books for students of Class VIII for the next year.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251405/rmg-workers-to-get-tcb-subsidised-food-items
ACC not yet free from influences,"Experts and stakeholders have underscored reforms in the Anti-Corruption Commission that would empower it to act with effective independence in its fight against corruption, freeing it from both political and bureaucratic influences. Their opinion has come as one in a set of recommendations which also include giving more power to the anti-graft body. Most of the times since its establishment, the top three officials—chairman and two commissioners—have been appointed from among retired bureaucrats, while serving bureaucrats have been appointed to other key posts, including the secretary and directors general. Although a search committee is there whose task is to recommend six potential names for the president to pick three officials from, in reality retired civil servants were awarded the positions in most cases. The government, by dint of its authority for appointing the top brass of the organisation, placed its favoured officers in the commission and maintained comfortable control over it. As a result, the agency’s ability to act with independence in fighting corruption had remained severely tied down right from its establishment in 2004, experts told New Age. Despite officially being an independent agency, the anti-corruption commission has rather been used as a weapon by the political governments against their opponents, they observe. For the same reason, the agency could rarely take into account the corruption allegations brought against the powerful ones, particularly the politicians, bureaucrats and businesspeople belonging to or associated with the ruling parties, experts have said. Even the commission, in most cases, had failed to initiate an inquiry or file any cases against powerful quarters without a go-ahead from the government. Transparency International Bangladesh executive director Iftekharuzzaman observes, ‘The ACC never had played a role as an independent body as the partisan governments held the agency hostage, while it was all through controlled by the bureaucrats.’ ‘All the political governments used the ACC as a weapon for harassing opposition people in the past, but the trend should change to fight corruption,’ he adds. The Anti-Corruption Commission must be freed from political and bureaucratic influences with some of its rules requiring amendment to enable it to work independently, according to Iftekharuzzaman, also head of the ACC Reform Commission, one of the reform commissions recently formed by the incumbent interim government. ‘Reform is needed to free the ACC from the influence of bureaucrats and government, while there is also a need for political and administrative reforms,’ he added. ‘There is a search committee to appoint the chairman and commissioners [of the ACC], but there is no policy regarding the selection of the chair and commissioners, and none but those close to the government get appointed to these posts,’ said former anti-corruption commission director general Moyeedul Islam. ‘The government appointed people close to it. Being appointed, they worked according to the will and interest of the political governments instead of exercising its role as an independent body,’ he said. ‘The independence is only on paper. The ACC never showed its independence despite having strong laws,’ Moyeedul said. Another former commission director general, Sayed Iqbal Hossain, underscores empowering the selection committee to work independently, saying, ‘The selection committee should be given the opportunity to work impartially, free from the influence of the government or any other groups, to recommend names of commissioners for appointment.’ The appointment in deputation at the anti-corruption commission should also be limited, he further suggests. Iqbal also suggested bringing transparency to the selection of graft complaints, ensuring proof of receipt of each complaint, and ensuring immediate entry in the Investigation and Prosecution Management System. He also suggested that skilled human resources should be developed for conducting investigation of money laundering complaints competently. He also observes that the special judges’ courts which are tasked with dealing with the graft cases should not deal with other cases for quick completion of the cases, reducing the backlog. ‘Above all, the ACC should be granted the status of a constitutional and legal institution to make it a truly powerful institution like India’s Central Bureau of Investigation, and the United States’ Federal Bureau of Investigation,’ Iqbal added. Former commission director general Moyeedul Islam is also for a powerful permanent prosecution unit at the agency, saying, ‘It is essential to establish an efficient and strong permanent prosecution unit at the ACC by formulating necessary rules as per section 32(2) of the ACC Act.’ He also suggests establishing a new court or tribunal to try only the corruption cases to reduce the backlog through expedited trial proceedings. ‘A provision should also be made to prohibit appeal revision in the High Court during the interim period before the case is settled,’ he said. ‘To expedite the final disposition of all corruption cases, it is necessary to form two or three completely separate anti-corruption appellate courts or tribunals, comprising of qualified judges from the High Court.’ Moyeedul added. Stakeholders have also referred to the ACC Act, 2004 they says that the commission shall be an independent and impartial agency and so its officers must also have the freedom to work making it an independent body. Section 54(2) of the ACC (Employees) Service Rules, 2008 states, however, says, ‘Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these rules, the competent authority may, without mentioning any reason, remove any employee from service by giving him 90 days’ notice or by paying him 90 days’ salary in cash.’ ‘It is never possible for the officers to work independently and impartially if this sword (section 54) is hanging over their heads,’ said a current director general of the ACC. But the commission has no power to take any legal actions against any of the officials posted there in deputation from other government offices for any wrongdoing. The commission’s reputation is compromised as many of its officers do not have adequate experience, understanding and skills regarding conducting inquiries and investigations into graft charges. Also the commission’s Money Laundering Unit must be strengthened to bring back assets laundered abroad, according to experts. Seven state agencies, including the ACC, are working to prevent money laundering, but all their efforts are fraught with a severe lack of coordination. To bring back laundered money abroad, apart from vesting adequate power in the anti-corruption commission, the commission and Bangladesh Bank must sign agreements with the anti-corruption agencies of various countries. The commission also needs to be fully digitalised and stop working manually, while a separate intelligence cell should be established within it to strictly monitor its officers and employees, experts suggest. Apart from rewarding its officials for outstanding performance, they should also be provided with risk allowances. Amid demands for reforms in the anti-corruption commission following the fall of the Awami League regime amid a student-led mass uprising on August 5, the Transparency International Bangladesh also presented a number of recommendations to the interim government. It suggested the removal of the administrative and financial powers from the commission secretary that were given to the post through an order in 2023. The TIB also said that a permanent task force should be formed, involving the Anti-Corruption Commission, Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit, National Board of Revenue, Criminal Investigation Department, and the Attorney General’s Office, for effectively fighting corruption and money laundering. It also said that the provision of obtaining government permission to arrest government employees in criminal cases (Section 41, 1) in the ‘Government Services Act, 2018’ should be revoked.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251404/acc-not-yet-free-from-influences
Coordinated efforts stressed to ensure child protection,"Speakers, including representatives from non-governmental organisation, at a dialogue on Wednesday emphasised the need for coordinated efforts to enhance child protection. The observation was made at the Multi-Stakeholders Dialogue to Stop Child Protection, organised by Terre des Hommes Netherlands in collaboration with Breaking the Silence and VERC in the capital. The event was organised as part of the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence campaign, focusing on raising awareness in society and taking effective actions to prevent child sexual abuse and enhance child protection. In his opening speech, Mahmoodul Kabir, Country Director of Terre des Hommes Netherlands, said, ‘The realities of child marriage, physical and mental violence, online harassment, and the drop-out rate are creating a crisis in our society, and we need coordinated efforts to resolve them. No individual or organisation can solve these issues alone.’ He further said that Bangladesh was at a pivotal crossroads, where its rapid economic development must be matched with an uncompromising focus on child protection that addressed the intersecting vulnerabilities of children. Speakers emphasised that children from working class families often endure greater mental pressure from their families, with girls particularly facing stress related to child marriage and boys being pressured into child labour. During the dialogue, child representatives highlighted several key demands, including establishment of day care centres, safety in schools and playgrounds, effective measures to prevent online harassment, and elimination of child marriages. The executive director of Breaking the Silence, Rokshana Sultana, called on the government to implement necessary policies and measures to ensure education and protection for girls, particularly to prevent child marriage and provide incentives for enrolling children in school. She also emphasised the need for the government to build community-based protection systems and increase awareness among parents and children about their rights. Representatives of the garment industry promised to work jointly with the government and relevant organisations to prevent child labour.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251403/coordinated-efforts-stressed-to-ensure-child-protection
Israeli snipers shoot Palestinians for sport,"ISRAEL’S attempts to excuse the mass murder of civilians in Gaza as ‘collateral damage’ fall apart in the face of mounting evidence that it employs deliberate sniper attacks. The targeted killing of unarmed people — using quadcopter drones and professional snipers — has restricted access to essential medical care, food, and water, exposing a chilling reality behind the occupation army’s actions. The International Criminal Court’s arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant are further testament to this not being a conventional war; it is a systematic targeting of civilians that points directly to genocidal intent. Over the past year, debates have raged over what constitutes an ‘acceptable’ level of collateral damage in Gaza. In July, the West Point US Military Academy’s Modern War Institute even published a piece that argued for a more surgical approach to be taken by the Israelis. Similar discussions that also surround what constitutes a ‘disproportionate use of force’ are all predicated on Tel Aviv’s approach being one of a conventional war. However, if Israel’s intention is not to wage war against Hamas and is instead to intentionally commit genocide and ethnic cleansing, these conversations prove meaningless. And no clearer evidence exists than the cold-blooded targeting of civilians by sniper fire.  Sniping civilians on live TV THOUGH there have been instances when sniper attacks on civilians captured the international media’s attention, this grim element of Israel’s military strategy is largely ignored, likely because of the damning implications. The first major case to break headlines in the western media was the murder of two Christian women at Gaza City’s Holy Family Church on 16 December 2023. The incident even received condemnation from the Pope over the murder of the Palestinian Catholic mother and her daughter, who were deliberately killed while seeking refuge inside the church compound. But today, these kinds of shootings are so commonplace that they even occur during live TV interviews with western news outlets. For example, in January, British broadcaster ITV captured the moment when 51-year-old Ramzi Abu Sahloul was shot through the chest, only moments after he had spoken on air. Sahloul was part of a group of civilians who were fleeing to Rafah in Gaza’s south while holding white flags on the orders of the Israeli military. Another innocent civilian murdered while fleeing and with a white flag was Hala Khreis; she was shot and fatally wounded while holding her grandson’s hand as they were walking. The incident was also caught on camera. A CNN investigation was able to prove that Israeli soldiers stationed nearby were responsible.  Intimidation by assassination PALESTINIAN correspondent Motasem Dalloul, who is based in northern Gaza, testifies to The Cradle that his own son Yahya was murdered by an Israeli sniper on 29 May, after which the soldiers ran over his child’s body with a tank. ‘I took my sons to our destroyed house, in Al-Sabra neighbourhood, in order to pick up some clothes from under the rubble. When we were there, I saw my son fall to the ground and he started bleeding from his head. I got close to him and found that his head had exploded.’ He explains that although he couldn’t see the Israeli soldiers, he knew that they were positioned nearby with sniper weapons and states that when he approached little Yahya’s body, he was struck by the fact that he was motionless. He adds: ‘Israeli tanks began shooting and firing everywhere. I knew that my son was dead … so I had to leave him on the ground and flee with my other sons to safety. I couldn’t return back to this place for 10 days, where I later found that an Israeli tank had run over his body and dismembered it, we could only collect some of his flesh and bones, which had been smashed by the Israeli tanks, and we put them in a piece of fabric, like a shirt, and took them, burying them in a makeshift cemetery.’ During Dalloul’s conversation with The Cradle, bombs exploding in the background are heard as he recounts: ‘I think the reason Israeli occupation [word muffled by the sound of explosions] killed my son was to frighten the rest of us and warn us not to return to this area … as that area was later on destroyed and all the buildings were erased, turning it into a military buffer zone. This put much pressure on the residents of Gaza City who do not have homes and a lot of these displaced people were murdered.’  Psychological warfare and denial of medical care THE calculated targeting of civilians is not limited to sniper fire. On 20 September, a UN special committee reported to the General Assembly that there has also been a ‘deliberate denial of healthcare access by Israeli snipers’ to lactating and pregnant Palestinian women. After countless testimonies of deliberate shootings committed against civilians have been emerging, in December 2023, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a press release urging accountability and an investigation. The press release also highlighted the execution of 11 men in front of their families in the Remal neighbourhood of Gaza City. Yassin, a young man from Jabalia Refugee Camp, describes to The Cradle how he was shot from a quadcopter drone in mid-November of 2023, managing to survive by mere chance. Yassin says that he was traveling on foot, using Salah al-Deen Road between Jabalia and Khan Younis, after receiving evacuation orders from the occupation army to move south. While he was fleeing, an armed clash suddenly erupted within his visual range: ‘I picked up my clothes and phone and ran from the place to escape this clash. There was a hill of sand in front of me, I jumped off it, and some of my clothes fell. Then I found the ambulance that the enemy [Israel] had stopped, remaining on the road.’ Scared, he said he heard calls in Arabic for him to stop running, then ‘I heard the sound of the bullet, so I asked in a loud voice ‘Who was shot?’ After 10 meters, I realized this bullet had exploded inside my liver, and I was the answer to my own question. This bullet penetrated my right lung, then the diaphragm, then exploded in the liver.’ Yassin says that the only reason he survived was because a relative happened to be driving a nearby ambulance and acted quickly to save his life. Yassin’s recovery has been a long and grueling journey spanning several months, and he continues to suffer from his injuries despite evacuating across the Rafah Crossing into Egypt.  A policy of deliberate targeting AMERICAN surgeon Mark Perlmutter, who traveled to Gaza in order to treat wounded Palestinians during the war, has also drawn specific attention to the intentional targeting of children by Israeli sniper fire. ‘No child gets shot twice by mistake,’ he told France 24. Perlmutter has burst into tears during several interviews while describing how scores of children had died in front of his eyes. Perlmutter’s accounts align with the recent testimony of British doctor Nizam Mamode, who described to UK Members of Parliament how drones would deliberately shoot children ‘day after day’ in Gaza. Such accounts have been emerging from foreign physicians throughout the war, with nine other on-the-ground doctors providing accounts of the calculated targeting of children to The Guardian earlier this year. The Cradle also received testimony from a Palestinian man from northern Gaza whose brother was shot by an Israeli sniper in October during Israel’s re-invasion. As he tried to drag his brother to safety, he was repeatedly targeted by snipers and eventually had to watch his brother slowly die from his wounds. He explains that they fled their homes to Gaza City, but he and his brother decided to return when the fighting was less intense, noting that the shooting erupted out of nowhere when they were in the Jabalia area. He then saw his brother collapse and bleed everywhere, noting that the bullet hit him in the middle of his body.  Twisted tactics THE accounts provided to The Cradle are but a few in a long list of similar horrors that emerge on a daily basis from the Gaza Strip. In April, Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor released a report that pointed out Israel’s use of intimidating sounds to scare and lure civilians into kill zones. In the Nuseirat Refugee Camp, drones were recorded playing the sounds of babies crying in order to draw civilians out of their homes and into the streets so that they could be fired upon. Throughout the writing of this piece, over a dozen eyewitnesses to shootings — including journalists and doctors in Gaza — were consulted. All confirmed that Israeli snipers deliberately target civilians without any justification to instill fear that prevents people from moving freely. A Palestinian doctor from northern Gaza, who requested anonymity, tells The Cradle, ‘They are shooting civilians for sport, and this is clearly deliberate; this must be the policy of the army.’  ScheerPost.com, November 26.

Student violence goes against July uprising spirit,"THE streets of Dhaka, long bustling with the vigour of youth and the promise of intellectual pursuits, were transformed into battle zones over the past week. What should have been a celebration of academic heritage turned into a shameful display of student violence. The clashes between students of Dhaka College and City College, as well as the broader unrest involving other institutions such as Suhrawardy College, Kabi Nazrul Government College, and Dr Mahbubur Rahman Mollah College, have left at least 100 injured and countless others horrified and ashamed. On Dhaka College’s 184th founding anniversary, instead of pride, the city bore witness to senseless violence. What began as a celebratory moment devolved into a clash of egos and unchecked aggression. According to reports, the violence erupted at the Science Laboratory intersection, where City College students allegedly attacked buses carrying Dhaka College students. What followed was a brutal exchange of blows, brickbats, and vandalism that paralysed traffic and endangered innocent bystanders. This is not an isolated incident. Only days earlier, similar chaos erupted in Jatrabari involving students from Suhrawardy, Kabi Nazrul, and Dr Mahbubur Rahman Mollah colleges. Armed with sticks and iron rods, students attacked their peers, leaving over a hundred injured. The sight of students hurling bricks and wielding weapons horrified onlookers, tarnishing the reputation of institutions that are supposed to nurture the leaders of tomorrow. Educational institutions are meant to be sanctuaries of learning, centres where students gain knowledge, develop critical thinking, and learn values that contribute to building a harmonious society. Instead, these violent episodes have transformed these campuses into arenas of destruction. The violence erodes the sanctity of education and raises unsettling questions: Are these students truly embodying the ideals of discipline and respect that their institutions claim to instill? How have we, as a society, allowed educational institutions to become breeding grounds for aggression and rivalry? This shameful behaviour is a betrayal of the spirit of education and the essence of the July-August Revolution of 2024, which was built on unity, resilience, and a collective vision for a better future. The recent clashes stand in stark contrast to that revolutionary spirit, showcasing division, hostility, and a disturbing disregard for human life. The violent clashes not only harmed students but also caused immense suffering to Dhaka’s residents. The Science Laboratory intersection, one of the busiest in the city, became a no-go zone during the chaos. Commuters were stranded, businesses were disrupted, and the city’s fragile infrastructure was further strained. In Jatrabari, the situation was no better. The repeated rounds of attacks and counterattacks turned the area into a battlefield, forcing authorities to deploy police, army personnel, and even six platoons of the Border Guard Bangladesh to restore order. Such incidents not only disrupt daily life but also create a pervasive sense of fear and insecurity among the public. As citizens, we are horrified by the scale of the violence and ashamed of the behaviour of those who are meant to be the torchbearers of our nation’s future. The images of bloodied students, shattered glass, and burning vehicles haunt our collective conscience. This violence is a stark reminder of the deep-seated issues plaguing our educational system and society at large. The clashes highlight a failure at multiple levels — educational institutions failing to instill values of tolerance and conflict resolution, families not addressing the emotional well-being of their children, and authorities struggling to enforce accountability. It is a moment of collective shame that demands reflection and action. If we allow such violence to continue unchecked, we risk not only tarnishing the image of our educational institutions but also fostering a culture of division and hatred that could have far-reaching consequences. As citizens, educators, and policymakers, we must take decisive steps to address this crisis. First, promoting dialogue and conflict resolution. Educational institutions must establish mechanisms for dialogue and mediation to address disputes before they escalate. Workshops on conflict resolution, emotional intelligence, and ethical behaviour should be a mandatory part of the curriculum. Second, strengthening security and oversight. Campuses must enhance security measures to prevent the infiltration of external elements and ensure that students adhere to disciplinary guidelines. Authorities must take swift and transparent action against those responsible for violence, sending a clear message that such behaviour will not be tolerated. Third, encouraging unity. Teachers, students, and administrators must work together to foster a sense of unity and shared purpose. Institutions should organise collaborative programs that bring together students from different colleges, promoting mutual understanding and camaraderie. Fourth, reviving the spirit of the July-August revolution. The July-August Revolution of 2024 symbolised a united front against oppression and injustice. It is time to revisit that spirit and remind our students of the values of unity, resilience, and progress that lie at the heart of our national identity. Finally, parental and societal responsibility. Families must play a proactive role in shaping the values of young individuals. Society at large must condemn violence and celebrate the virtues of education and mutual respect. The recent violence among college students in Dhaka is a wake-up call for all of us. It is a stark reminder that education is not just about acquiring knowledge but also about shaping character and values. We must rise above the shame and horror of these incidents and work collectively to ensure that our educational institutions become true centres of excellence. Let us turn this moment of crisis into an opportunity for reflection and change. Let us pledge to nurture a generation that values dialogue over division, unity over conflict, and progress over destruction. Only then can we honour the legacy of our past and build a future that we can all be proud of.

Unattended level crossings continue to cause death,"CASES of trains ramming vehicles on the level crossing, leaving people dead, hardly appear to be ending even after a noticeable number of such accidents. At least seven died after a train had hit a battery-powered auto-rickshaw at Burichang in Cumilla on November 26. Railway authorities say that the level crossing was unauthorised and unattended. In a business-as-usual move, a committee was formed to investigate the incident while the railway authorities say their initial investigation found no fault of the driver. Any post-accident discussion on level crossing accidents mostly revolves around whether the level crossings were illegal, not under the jurisdiction of the railway authorities or the crossings were gated and attended. Experts have, however, for long asked the government to install an automated system for level crossing management to avoid human errors. The National Economic Council approved plans for an unattended and far-controlled level crossing system in 2015, but the projects were not implemented. People, meanwhile, continue to die on the level crossings that could have been prevented. In 2005–2020, 419 people died and more than 2,000 became injured in 4,914 train accidents. A majority of the accidents took place on unattended level crossings. The authorities acknowledge the problem but consider recruiting staff for all level crossings to be burdensome for an agency that is incurring losses. The Bangladesh Railway has experienced a severe crisis of human resources, a major reason there has been a spike in railway accidents. In fact, the agency is run with only a third of the required drivers, station masters and guards. Many technical staff lack training to discharge their responsibilities. Since 1947, successive governments have invested very little in the expansion of the railway infrastructure. It is, therefore, not surprising that the railway has become accident-prone, its resources are depleted and its land is illegally occupied. The erratic train schedule, declining customer care and uneven investment in the road transport sector have made many train stations non-operational. Recurring accidents and the state of the railway demonstrate the government’s prolonged negligence towards the sector. In addition to speedy implementation of the projects already undertaken, the government should take drastic measures to stop any new installation of unauthorised level crossings, bring under its purview all that remains outside and employ trained personnel to supervise and run level crossings round the clock. The government should also consider the proposal for a safety audit, as suggested by experts, and prepare a long-term master plan to guide the overall development of the railway in the foreseeable future. The potential of the railway needs to be unlocked through planned investment.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/251372/unattended-level-crossings-continue-to-cause-death
Unwarranted Indian interference,"THIS is quite disconcerting that the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Hindu nationalist government of India has expressed ‘concern’ about the arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das, spokesperson of Sanatan Jagaran Mancha and a ‘former’ leader of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, or ISKCON, on specific charges of sedition. Moreover, the chief of the West Bengal BJP, Suvendu Adhikari, reportedly threatened Bangladesh the same day that the party would ‘block the Bangladesh-India border, if Chinmoy Das is not released.’ These are unwarranted interferences by Indian authorities with the internal affairs of Bangladesh and, that too, as the government of Bangladesh has already pointed out that day, on fabricated allegations, mostly propagated by a section of the communally oriented Indian media. While ISKCON was banned in some countries on charges of terrorism, the Chinmoy-led Sanatan Jagaran Mancha has recently created troubles in society, in the name of upholding the interests of the minority community, palpably to destabilise the nascent government of Dr Muhammad Yunus, installed after the fall of Sheikh Hasina’s autocratic government in the face of a students-led popular mass uprising. That Chinmoy’s religious preaching has hardly anything to do with the welfare of the Hindu community of Bangladesh was amply proved when he kept completely silent over various kinds of repression of the Hindu community by Hasina’s autocratic regime over the past 15 years. To give a couple of examples, Chinmoy kept silent over the much-talked-about brutal murder of a politically innocent Hindu young man, Biswajit Das, by the Awami League goons in 2012, and the forcible ouster of chief justice SK Sinha by the League regime in 2017, because of the former’s refusal to entertain Hasina’s unlawful desires. Evidently, the interests of Chinmoy’s Sanatan Jagaran Mancha and those of the patriotic Sanatani Hindus in Bangladesh are not the same. However, we at New Age are aware that some Hindu citizens were exposed to troubles, some were arrested as well, after the ouster of the League regime, but we are also aware that most of them faced the troubles and arrests not because of their religious identity but, rather, their political identity, Awami League that is — the party that oppressed and harassed thousands of its opponents for years and finally conducted a massacre of the democratically oriented protesters in July–August. Like the Muslim leaders and activists of the autocratic Awami League, their Hindu counterparts were exposed to public wrath while both the government and the people stood by the politically innocent Hindus against any possible attacks by the criminals. Under such circumstances, when the non-party interim government of Yunus is busy stabilising the post-mass uprising instability, this Chinmoy, and his Santan Jagaran Mancha, appeared on the scene with his palpably ill-intentioned communal issues, posing a threat to the traditional religious harmony in the Bangladesh society, forcing the government to take legal steps against him. Why should the Indian government be unhappy about that? Does the Indian Hindu nationalist government of the Bharatiya Janata Party want the post-Hasina Bangladesh to be exposed to communal disharmony, pushing the Hindu minorities into trouble in the Muslim majority Bangladesh? While Indian interference in Bangladesh’s internal affairs is not welcome, the democratically oriented Bangladeshis must remain alert to any political design — local or foreign — of causing communal disharmony in the country.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/251371/unwarranted-indian-interference
