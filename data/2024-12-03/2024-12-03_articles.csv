Export earnings rise by 16.23pc in Nov,"Bangladesh’s export earnings have maintained a positive growth for five months (July-November) of the financial year 2024-25, posting a 16.23-per cent increase in November, due mainly to increased shipments of readymade garments. According to the Export Promotion Bureau provisional data, the country’s export earnings in November, 2024 increased by $578.22 million year-on-year to $4.14 billion compared with those of $3.56 billion in the same month of 2023. Bangladesh’s export earnings in July-November of FY25 also increased by 11.88 per cent to $19.93 billion compared with those of $17.81billion in the same period of FY24, the provisional data showed. The previous financial year 2023-24 ended on a downbeat note, with export earnings declining by 8.54 per cent in June. The country’s export earnings came back on the positive trajectory in July, the first month of FY25 with a 2.93-per cent growth. Growth accelerated in the following months, with earnings rising by 5.51 per cent in August, 15.43 per cent in September and 20.65 per cent in October riding on the performance of the apparel sector, the EPB data showed. Although the export data on RMG for November 2024 is yet to be available, exporters said that there was a steady rise in shipments over the past few months, aligning with the overall growth in export earnings. ‘The rise in apparel shipments is due largely to the accumulation of orders that were deferred in August and September amid student protests and labour unrests,’ said Mahmud Hasan Khan, a former vice-president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, told New Age on Tuesday. He said that while apparel exporters were receiving more orders from global buyers, prices remained low. ‘Manufacturers are being forced to accept orders at reduced prices due to increased production capacity,’ Mahmud said. However, he expressed concerns about the sustainability of the recent export growth, warning that without improved law and order and adequate banking support, the growth could falter.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/apparel/251950/export-earnings-rise-by-16.23pc-in-nov

Bangladesh lose to SL in final group game,"Bangladesh Under-19 cricket team suffered a narrow seven-run defeat against Sri Lanka in their third and final group-stage match of the ACC U-19 Asia Cup at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Tuesday. Bangladesh have already secured their semi-final spot by beating Afghanistan and Nepal in the other Group B matches. Chasing a target of 229, the junior Tigers were all out for 221 in 49.3 overs, despite a defiant 95 from Kalam Siddiki Aleen. Opting to bat first, Sri Lanka struggled against Bangladesh bowlers led by Al Fahad (4-50) and Rizan Hossan (3-40), who consistently took wickets at regular intervals. Vimath Dinsara top-scored with 106 off 132 balls laced with 10 boundaries; captain Vihas Thewmika (22) and Lakvin Abeysinghe (21) also played brief knocks to help Sri Lanka post 228.

HC questions energy master plan’s alignment with climate goals,"The High Court on Tuesday issued a rule asking the government to explain in four weeks why the Integrated Energy and Power Master Plan (IEPMP) should not be reviewed to align with Bangladesh’s climate goals. The bench of Justice Fahmida Quader and Justice Mubina Asaf also sought clarification on why the government should not prioritise implementing the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan (MCPP) 2022–2041, which was approved in accordance with international climate treaties such as the Paris Agreement. The rule followed a writ petition filed by Monera Haque Mone, Supreme Court lawyer and chairman of Lawyers for Energy Environment and Development Limited. The lawyer challenged the government’s inaction in implementing the MCPP and its approval of the IEPMP, which allegedly contradicts national and international climate commitments. The rule was issued to the secretaries of the ministries of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, and Environment, Forest and Climate Change, along with the heads of different energy and environmental agencies, including, the chairman of the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority, the chairman of the Bangladesh Energy and Power Research Council, the director general of Power Cell, the director general of the Department of Environment, and the managing director of Bangladesh Climate Change Trust. The petitioner’s counsel, Abdullah Al Noman, argued that the IEPMP heavily relies on fossil fuels such as coal and gas, undermining commitments to the Paris Agreement and the Climate Vulnerable Forum Vision, which advocates for a 1.5°C global temperature cap and long-term climate resilience. Noman argued that the IEPMP violated Sections 6A and 6C of the Environment Conservation Act, 1995, which prohibit activities harmful to the environment. He argued that IEPMP contradicted Article 18A of the Constitution, which obligates the state to safeguard natural resources, biodiversity, and ecosystems for future generations. Noman further argued that coal-fired power plants, a significant component of the IEPMP, emit harmful pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. He said that these pollutants exacerbate respiratory diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Fossil fuel emission is a leading driver of climate change, contributing to rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and increased flood risks that disproportionately affect Bangladesh. Noman argued that the IEPMP relies on unproven technologies, such as hydrogen and ammonia co-firing, raising concerns about economic viability and scalability. Despite promoting renewable energy, the plan still projects that 30.7 per cent of energy in 2050 will come from fossil fuels like coal and LNG, while advanced technologies like liquid hydrogen and ammonia will contribute 32.8 per cent, he argued. He also argued that the IEPMP, prepared with assistance from the Japan International Cooperation Agency, starkly contrasts with the MCPP, which envisions 100 per cent renewable energy by 2050. Noman said that JICA has also funded several fossil fuel-based energy projects in Bangladesh, further complicating the nation’s climate commitments.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/environment-climate-change/251946/hc-questions-energy-master-plans-alignment-with-climate-goals

Train service disruption continues for third day,"Disruption to the train services across the country continued for the third consecutive day on Tuesday as the running staff members of the Bangladesh Railway continued their movement for restoration of their previous benefits for working extra hours. On the day, journeys of some local and commuter trains were cancelled and most of the trains ran behind their schedules by one hour to one hour and a half amid huge sufferings of the passengers. Journeys of some freight trains were also cancelled to run the passenger trains on the priority basis, they added. Since December 1 the railway staff, under the banner of the Bangladesh Railway Running Staff and Sramik Karmachari Samity, stopped doing additional duty except scheduled eight hours and stopped doing duty at rest. The running staff members included locomasters, assistant locomasters, sub-locomasters and shunting locomasters who are directly involved in running the trains and maintaining the locomotives or the train engines. The railway is already reeling with the shortage of these locomasters as against 2,200 sanctioned posts about 1,000 are working now, said the union leaders. According to the Bangladesh Railway’s central control office on Tuesday six local trains on the Mymensingh-Mohonganj, Mymensingh- Jharia Jhanjail and Mymensingh-Dewanganj and two trains on the Chattogram-Nazirhat routes were cancelled. Some four to five freight trains were also not being operated due to lack of running staff to run them, said officials. The railway officials at Kamalapur Railway Station in Dhaka also said that on Tuesday the journeys of Turag Express on the Dhaka to Joydevpur route had been cancelled. At the station on Tuesday afternoon a huge number of passengers were seen waiting for trains. ‘It is frustrating to find that the trains are running late for the movement of the staff,’ said Shahidul Islam, a passenger of Kalni Express on the Sylhet route. Trains including Kalni Express on the Dhaka-Sylhet, Silkcity Express on the Dhaka-Rajshahi, Rangpur Express on the Dhaka-Rangpur and Dolanchapa Express on Shantahar-Panchagarh routes were running by one hour and a half to one hour  behind their schedules. According to the running staff members before 2022 they got special financial facilities under the Railways Act. The running staff members including locomasters, assistant locomasters and sub-locomasters have duty period of eight hours daily, but they have to work for an average 15 to 18 hours due to shortage of workforces, they said. Under the law, they got the mileage facility which meant that for every 100 kilometres of train run they received an additional amount of money equivalent to one day’s basic salary. Following this, if a working day is defined by an eight-hour shift, the running staff members work the equivalent of maximum three months of working days in a single month and before 2022 they had got salaries like that. In 2022, the Finance Division cancelled these facilities and the running staffs started their movement demanding these facilities again. The union working president, Saidur Rahman, told New Age on Tuesday that they would continue their movement until their demand was met.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251944/train-service-disruption-continues-for-third-day

"Hamas, Fatah agree on joint committee to run post-war Gaza","Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas and Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas’s Fatah party have agreed to create a committee to jointly administer post-war Gaza, negotiators from both sides said on Tuesday. Under the plan, which needs Abbas’s approval, the committee would be composed of 10 to 15 non-partisan figures with authority on matters related to the economy, education, health, humanitarian aid and reconstruction, according to a draft of the proposal seen by AFP. Following talks in Cairo brokered by Egypt, the two rival Palestinian movements agreed the committee would administer the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing with Egypt, the territory’s only one not shared with Israel. Fatah’s delegation, led by central party committee member Azzam al-Ahmad, will return to Ramallah Tuesday to seek Abbas’s final approval, the negotiators said. Wassil Abu Yussef, member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organisation which includes Fatah, will convene later Tuesday to decide whether to approve the committee arrangement or not. Hamas’s delegation was led by politburo member Khalil al-Hayya. However, Jibril Rajoub, Fatah’s number three and secretary-general of its central committee, expressed doubts the deal would ever get over the line. ‘What committee is this? It is wrong to even discuss this issue,’ Rajoub told reporters in the West Bank city of Ramallah Tuesday, adding it would bring ‘division’. Rajoub said that he did not favour any deal that would lead to separate political systems in Gaza and in the occupied West Bank, which Fatah rules under the internationally recognised Palestinian Authority. ‘We want one government, one security apparatus, and one unified policy. Any discussion or effort outside of this framework is a mistake,’ he said. ‘We will not be part of any step that entrenches division or aligns with the path Netanyahu desires,’ he added. Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian political analyst and former minister and diplomat, also expressed doubts. ‘Gaza is now under complete Israeli control, and there is little significance for any arrangement that does not take into consideration the Israeli presence there,’ he said. Should the agreement actually be implemented, he said its value would depend on whether Israel maintains a military presence in the Gaza Strip. If the deal is applied while Israel retains control of Gaza, Khatib said, ‘then I don’t think this agreement is good, because this will release Israel from its duties as an occupier.’ The agreement’s announcement comes at a time of renewed diplomatic efforts to end the war between Hamas and Israel, which has devastated the Gaza Strip. According to UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, the situation in the territory is ‘horrific and apocalyptic’. The truce efforts, led by the United States in coordination with Qatar, Egypt and Turkey, come in the wake of a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. As the administration of US president Joe Biden prepares to hand over power in January to president-elect Donald Trump, Palestinians face intense US pressure to ensure that Hamas will have no role in Gaza once the war ends. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, one of the most right-wing in Israel’s history, made Hamas’s destruction in Gaza one of its main war objectives. It has repeatedly expressed strong opposition to the Palestinian Authority playing a major role in the Gaza Strip after the war. It has also categorically refused any semblance of a return to the status quo ante, where Hamas ruled Gaza. The war began on October 7, 2023, sparked by Hamas’s unprecedented attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,208 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official data. Israel’s retaliatory military campaign in the Gaza Strip has resulted in at least 44,466 deaths, mostly civilians, according to data from Gaza’s Hamas-run Health Ministry, which the UN considers reliable.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/251942/hamas-fatah-agree-on-joint-committee-to-run-post-war-gaza
Riazul hopes to revive hockey’s glory,"Bangladesh Hockey Federation ad-hoc committee general secretary, Lt Col (rtd) Riazul Hasan, is on a mission to reform hockey’s glory in Bangladesh. A former player and seasoned organiser, Riazul spoke to New Age’s Wahid Ullah Bakul about the challenges, plans, and prospects for the sport. New Age: What challenges are you facing or expect to face after taking charge of the BHF ad-hoc committee? Riazul Hasan:Our first challenge is ensuring regular hockey competitions. We have to earn players’ trust, providing a vibrant playing atmosphere for their return to the field. We aim to nurture current players and scout new talent, focusing on the basics of development to overcome these challenges. NA: What do you mean by the basics of development? Riazul:It involves grassroots initiatives like school and district-level competitions for talent hunt and grooming the young players. Otherwise, where will we get new players to create a strong players pool? If we succeed, hockey’s glory can return in four to five years. NA: There is a perception that hockey is the second most potential game of the country, but gaps between the federation and club organisers hinder its progress. How do you plan to address this? Riazul:Anyone who loves hockey will support its development. This month, we’ll meet club representatives to discuss their concerns and find solutions for restarting leagues. Regular leagues are essential; without them, all initiatives will be futile. NA: With reform sentiments across institutions, what kind of reforms does the federation need? Riazul:The current constitution seems effective. Unless I complete the study, I cannot say whether amendments are needed. Our top priority right now is to develop stadiums so that male and female players can play every day. The primary priority is to create a lively atmosphere on the pitch, followed by other aspects. NA: What other plans do you have? Riazul:We need more artificial turfs because they are vital. Currently, we have only one turf at the Maulana Bhashani National Hockey Stadium. Other countries excel because their players train on turfs. Our goal is to install at least one turf in every division. NA: How long will the ad-hoc committee run? Riazul:That depends on the National Sports Council. We’ll assist with elections whenever they decide. For now, we’re planning the Victory Day Hockey Tournament and organising two more events before next year’s leagues. NA: Financial challenges often plague the federation. How will you address that? Riazul:The federation can’t bear all the costs, and NSC’s support is not enough. So, most of our tournaments rely on sponsorships. We’ve already approached potential sponsors and are hopeful about securing their support. NA: Would you please share your experience with Bangladesh hockey? Riazul:I was a Dhaka-based hockey player from 1974 to 1995. I played for the Army national hockey team. I also played for Cantonment Sporting Club and Bangladesh Sporting Club. As an organiser, I served the Army Sports Control Board as an assistant secretary for over two years before my retirement in 1995. NA: What would you say about the prospect of Bangladesh hockey? Riazul:I’m an optimistic person. Our Under-21 team showed promise, and with sustained efforts, we can achieve a strong position at the Asian level and beyond.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/hockey/251941/riazul-hopes-to-revive-hockeys-glory

Metro emerge runners-up in NCL,"Dhaka Metro became runners-up as Khulna and Rangpur fought out a thrilling draw while Dhaka suffered a 122-run loss to bottom-placed Barishal on the final day of this season’s National Cricket League on Tuesday. Champions, Sylhet, also got the taste of their first defeat of the season when they lost to Rajshahi. Hosts Khulna declared their second innings on 147-6 at the Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium to set Rangpur a target of 259 runs. Rangpur got close to it despite losing their first five wickets for 58 runs.

Women-friendly healthcare service demanded,"Women suffer to get essential healthcare services from existing facilities due to lack of gender sensitiveness, said women rights activists at a discussion on Tuesday. The activists urged the government to address obstacles to receiving healthcare services. The non-government women rights organisation, Naripokkho, in collaboration with the Daily Prothom Alo organised the discussion in the capital. The organisation found that health service providing institutions lacked infrastructures as well as the service providers were not sensitised to women’s needs. Jahangirnagar University associate professor for anthropology Rezwana Karim Snigdha said that doctors and other healthcare providers in hospitals frequently asked women offensive questions when they went to get healthcare. Sometimes, in the case of abortion women are denied and service providers target them asking offensive questions such as who is the father of the child and why do they want abortion, she said. Naripokkho executive member Tasnim Azim said that in the 80s they started a movement to get body rights which was still relevant. She said that the government was trying to limit women’s access to medical menstrual regulation with medication, also known as MRM, which was harmful to women. She demanded making the MRM service available and safe. Women rights activists and head of the Women’s Affairs Reform Commission Shireen Parveen Haque said that she did not see any significant change over the past 40 years of the women rights movement. Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy director general Syed Jamil Ahmed said that some reforms including reforms in education, family structure, economic involvement and in some cultural matters were needed to overcome the situation.

"Nahid, batters turn things around for Tigers","Nahid Rana bagged his maiden five-wicket haul while the batters stood up to the occasion on the third day as Bangladesh turned the table around to take control of the second Test against the West Indies at Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica, on Monday. Bangladesh were 193-5 and were leading by 211 runs in the second innings after the completion of the third day after the hosts were bundled out for 146 runs to hand the visitors an 18-run lead in the first innings. Nahid, ‘the Bangladesh Express,’ dubbed by commentator and former West Indian pacer Ian Bishop, took 5-61 runs. ‘First I want to thank the almighty as I took my first five-wicket haul,’ Nahid said after the day’s play. ‘I didn’t try too many things. I just tried to bowl line to line without giving the batters any room and tried to bowl according to the batters.’ West Indies had no clue against Nahid’s pace and bounce as the hosts lost seven wickets in the first session of the third day for just 65 runs. Captain Kraigg Brathwaite was bounced out by Nahid to get caught at gully, whereas Kavem Hodge nicked one behind before surviving off the same bowler earlier. Taskin Ahmed then joined the party to clean bowl Alick Athanaze before Taijul Islam did the same to Justin Greaves. The lower order couldn’t hold up much longer as the Bangladeshi bowlers were in a mood. Nahid’s fifth wicket was Alzarri Joseph, who was trapped lbw before the lunch break. He didn’t get any after the break, but Kemar Roach was injured by his bouncer and was unable to come to bowl before the 31st over. That helped Bangladesh’s cause, who were batting with an aggressive intent. Mahmudul Hasan Joy, though, suffered his seventh duck in 32 innings when he was outside edged off Jayden Seales in the fifth ball of the innings. But it was Shahadat Hossain who started to play shots after coming in at three in place of sick Mominul Haque. That ultimately proved to be one shot too many, but his 26-ball 28 with four boundaries set things into motion. Captain Mehidy Hasan Miraz came at four and added 70 off just 74 balls with opener Shadman Islam to mount the pressure on the hosts. They fell in quick succession as Shadman made 46 while Mehidy scored 42 off 39. Both hit seven fours each. Liton Das was undone by a slower delivery off Greaves after scoring 25 while Jaker Ali (29*) and Taijul (9*) remained unbeaten. Nahid later said that he thought Bangladesh were in a good position and anything above 250 was a good score. ‘The wicket is slightly different; there’ll be uneven bounce and turn. So we can do something good on the fourth day.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251934/nahid-batters-turn-things-around-for-tigers-

26 injured in Georgia demos,"Georgia’s health ministry said on Tuesday that 26 people, mostly protesters, were injured in the latest night of anti-government protest in the Caucasus country. Georgia has been locked in a political crisis since its contested October election, with tens of thousands pro-EU protesters taking to the streets in recent days against the governing Georgian Dream party. Monday saw the fifth day of consecutive mass protests in Tbilisi following prime minister Irakli Kobakhidze’s announcement last week that the government would shelve talks on EU accession until 2028. The ministry said ‘26 individuals, including 23 protesters and three representatives of the ministry of internal affairs’ — a reference to law enforcement officers — were taken to medical facilities after the protest on Monday. ‘None of the injuries are life threatening,’ it added. The ministry also said that some of the injured ‘remain under medical supervision.’ Some Western countries have criticised Tbilisi for an excessive police response to the demonstrations, with the UN rights chief saying Monday that he was concerned about the ‘disproportionate’ use of force by law enforcement. The standoff between riot police and mostly young protesters continued throughout the night into Tuesday, with police using tear gas against hundreds of demonstrators who responded by throwing fireworks.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/251929/26-injured-in-georgia-demos
"Macron, Salman sign strategic partnership","President Emmanuel Macron and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman signed a strategic partnership on Monday aimed at deepening bilateral ties and de-escalating conflict in the Middle East, including Lebanon, where the two leaders called for presidential elections. The French leader arrived in Saudi Arabia on Monday for a three-day state visit just as a political crisis threatens to topple the French government. After a meeting with Prince Mohammed, the de facto ruler of the oil-rich Gulf kingdom, Macron’s office announced the signing of a new partnership aimed at improving cooperation in ‘defence, energy transition, culture, mobility between the two countries’. The two leaders also ‘agreed to make every effort to contribute to de-escalation in the region’, including helping to consolidate the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon. ‘Together, they called for the holding of presidential elections in Lebanon with the aim of bringing the Lebanese people together and carrying out the reforms necessary for the stability and security of the country,’ the statement from Macron’s office said. Macron touched down in the Saudi capital Riyadh in the afternoon, where he was greeted by an honour guard of sword-holding servicemen and celebratory cannon fire as he disembarked from his plane. He did not comment on the political situation in France as he arrived. Macron’s visit began as France’s less than three-month-old minority government faced the prospect of being forced out by a vote of no confidence in the coming days. The far-right National Rally party said it would vote to oust Michel Barnier’s government after the prime minister used an executive tool to push through a social security budget bill without parliamentary approval. The left wing is also expected to back the motion, which could be held as early as Wednesday. If successful, it would oust the government that was appointed in September after snap polls. Macron’s three-day stay also coincides with a flare-up of violence in Syria, where anti-government rebels have seized Aleppo, the country’s second-largest city. The fighting in Syria follows France’s brokering of a ceasefire in neighbouring Lebanon, where Israel has been fighting Iran proxy Hezbollah. Macron’s state visit is the first by a French president to Saudi Arabia since Jacques Chirac in 2006, cementing what the presidency calls a ‘very close relationship’. In 2021, Macron became one of the first Western leaders to meet Prince Mohammed in Saudi Arabia after the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Riyadh’s consulate in Istanbul. The French president and Prince Mohammed will see how they ‘work together’ on the conflicts shaking the region, with Lebanon at the ‘heart of the discussions’, the French presidency said in an earlier statement. Macron is hoping for Saudi support for the Lebanese army, which is being deployed towards the border with Israel under the ceasefire but is poorly armed and trained. He will also try to win Saudi help to reverse the political disintegration that has plunged Lebanon’s government and economy into catastrophe. Paris and Riyadh are also calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza war and a ‘political outcome’ based on the two-state solution of separate Israeli and Palestinian states. Saudi Arabia, home to the holiest sites in Islam, has paused discussions with Washington on potentially recognising Israel in return for deeper security and bilateral ties with the United States. In September, the crown prince hardened his position, insisting that Saudi Arabia would not establish ties with Israel before the creation of a Palestinian state. Macron is accompanied by about 50 senior officials from major French companies including TotalEnergies, EDF and Veolia, as well as start-ups in artificial intelligence and quantum physics. France and Saudi Arabia aim to ‘significantly strengthen’ their economic ties to ‘the height of our shared ambition’, the presidency said. Discussions are also under way for Saudi Arabia to acquire French-made Rafale fighter jets, although no announcement is expected during the visit, according to a source close to the matter.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/251928/macron-salman-sign-strategic-partnership
Taiwan’s president kicks off Marshall Islands visit as China fumes,"Taiwanese president Lai Ching-te arrived in the Marshall Islands on Tuesday, after visiting the United States on the first stop of a Pacific tour that has angered Chinese leaders. The Marshall Islands is one of 12 remaining nations that recognise Taiwan’s claim to statehood after others jumped ship to China following promises of aid and investment. China insists self-ruled Taiwan is part of its territory and opposes any official exchanges with the island. Beijing has sought to push Taipei off the international stage by poaching its allies and blocking it from global forums, including the United Nations. Marshall Islands president Hilda Heine extended Lai a ‘very warm welcome’ after his arrival in the capital Majuro, where the Taiwanese leader held talks with the government and attended a banquet. ‘Taiwan and the Marshall Islands share a traditional Austronesian culture as well as the values of freedom and democracy,’ Lai told Heine, speaking through an interpreter. Lai’s first overseas trip since taking office in May began with a two-day visit to the United States where he discussed ‘China’s military threats’ towards Taiwan during a call with former US House speaker Nancy Pelosi, and met with US government officials and members of Congress — drawing a fresh barrage of criticism from Beijing. China rejects any international recognition of Taiwan and its claim to be a sovereign state. It especially bristles at official contact between the island and Washington, Taiwan’s most important security backer. China on Tuesday vowed to defend its ‘national sovereignty’ and ‘territorial integrity’ as Lai visited the Marshall Islands. ‘The Taiwan issue is the core of China’s core interests,’ foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, when asked whether Beijing could launch another round of war games around the self-ruled island in response to the Pacific tour. After the Marshall Islands, Lai will visit Taiwan’s other remaining Pacific island allies Tuvalu and Palau as well as stop for one night in the US territory of Guam. The Marshall Islands, a sprawling chain of volcanic islands and coral atolls halfway between Hawaii and Australia, has a long-standing agreement with the United States that gives it security and budget guarantees. In return, the US military has access to its territory. ‘We are like family, and we are also close partners who support each other,’ Lai told Heine. ‘Over many years of mutual support, we have provided one another the greatest possible backing.’ In a speech to parliament, Lai announced Taiwan would provide a ‘preferential loan’ for state-owned Air Marshall Islands to purchase new aircraft. Taiwan, which has a long history of providing development finance in the Pacific, will also help build a pig slaughterhouse in 2025 to improve ‘food security’ in the Marshall Islands, Lai said. Lai thanked Heine for ‘personally speaking up for Taiwan at this year’s Pacific Islands Forum, United Nations General Assembly and COP 29’. China has fumed over recent US arms sales to Taiwan and Lai’s stop in the US island state of Hawaii, where he was welcomed with red carpets and garlands of flowers. Pelosi’s long-standing support for Taiwan has infuriated China, which responded to her visit to Taipei in 2022 with massive military drills around the island. Lai and Pelosi discussed ‘China’s military threats toward Taiwan’, presidential spokeswoman Karen Kuo told reporters in Hawaii, describing the 20-minute call between the ‘long-time friends’ as ‘warm and amicable’. In response to Lai’s conversation with Pelosi, China on Monday called on the United States to ‘stop meddling with Taiwan’ and cease ‘supporting and indulging Taiwan independence separatist forces’. Taiwan faces the constant threat of a military attack by China, which regularly deploys fighter jets and warships around the island to press its claims, and Beijing has not ruled out using force to bring the island under its control. China and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949, when Chiang Kai-shek’s nationalist forces were defeated by Mao Zedong’s communist fighters and fled to the island. In his first public speech of the trip on US soil, Lai said Saturday there was a need to ‘fight together to prevent war’, warning there were ‘no winners’ from conflict. On the eve of Lai’s week-long Pacific tour, the United States approved a proposed sale to Taiwan of spare parts for F-16s and radar systems, as well as communications equipment, in deals valued at $385 million in total.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/251927/taiwans-president-kicks-off-marshall-islands-visit-as-china-fumes
Iran’s president criticises new hijab law,"Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian has expressed doubts about new legislation imposing tougher penalties on women who flout mandatory hijab regulations. Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women in Iran have been required to cover their hair in public. However, increasing numbers are appearing without hijabs, especially since protests erupted following Mahsa Amini’s death in custody in September 2022. She had been arrested for allegedly violating the dress code. Parliament has approved the new ‘hijab and chastity’ law, but it requires the president’s signature on December 13 to take effect. ‘As the person responsible for promulgating this law, I have many reservations about it,’ Pezeshkian told state television late Monday. The text has not been officially published, but Iranian media reports say the legislation imposes fines equivalent to up to 20 months’ average salary for women who improperly wear a hijab or forgo it altogether in public or on social media. Violators must pay within 10 days or face travel bans and restrictions on public services, such as obtaining driving licences. ‘We risk ruining a lot of things in society because of this law,’ said the Iranian president, adding that leaders must avoid actions that could alienate the public. The morality police, who arrested Amini before the protests, have largely vanished from the streets since then, though the unit has not been officially abolished. Pezeshkian, who became president in July after campaigning to remove the morality police, has yet to announce whether he will sign the law.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/251926/irans-president-criticises-new-hijab-law

Army resistance toughens as rebels near Syria’s Hama,"Islamist-led rebels advanced on Syria’s fourth-largest city Hama Tuesday, buoyed by their lightning capture of swathes of the north in an offensive that ended four years of relative calm. The sudden flare-up in the more than decade-old civil war in Syria just as a fragile ceasefire took effect in neighbouring Lebanon drew appeals for de-escalation from across the international community. Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and its allies met much tougher resistance in the countryside north of Hama than they did in the Aleppo region on Friday and Saturday, a Britain-based war monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported the heaviest fighting with government forces so far as the offensive entered its seventh day. ‘Clashes have erupted in the northern Hama countryside, where rebel factions managed to seize several cities and towns in the last few hours,’ the Observatory said. ‘Syrian and Russian air forces carried out dozens of strikes on the area.’ Syrian state media reported that the two air forces had bombed the rebels in their Idlib stronghold as well as their vanguard in Hama province. Russia is a key ally of President Bashar al-Assad. Its 2015 intervention in the Syrian civil war turned the tide in his government’s favour but since 2022 the Ukraine war has tied down much of its military resources. Hama was a bastion of opposition to the Assad government early in the civil war. For many of the city’s residents, the scars of a 1982 massacre by the army, aimed at crushing the banned Muslim Brotherhood, have yet to heal. But its capture by the rebels would ‘pose a threat to the regime’s popular base’, Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. The countryside west of the city is home to many Alawites, followers of the same offshoot of Shiite Islam as the president and his security chiefs. An AFP journalist in the northern Hama countryside saw dozens of Syrian army tanks and military vehicles abandoned by the side of the road leading to Hama. ‘We want to advance on Hama after combing’ towns that have been captured, a rebel fighter who identified himself as Abu al-Huda al-Sourani said. The United Nations says nearly 50,000 people have been displaced by the fighting since it began last Wednesday. Hundreds of people have been killed, most of them combatants, according to the Observatory. The mounting exodus of civilians just as winter takes hold has triggered international alarm. UN chief Antonio Guterres said he was ‘alarmed’ by the violence and called for an immediate halt to the fighting. The European Union called on ‘all sides to de-escalate’. Speaking to reporters Monday, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said: ‘We want to see all countries use their influence — use their leverage — to push for de-escalation, protection of civilians and ultimately, a political process forward.’ Assad is no longer the pariah in the Arab world that he was at the height of the civil war. Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf Arab states have all expressed concern over his government’s losses. At a summit in Cairo last year, Arab leaders agreed to reinstate Syria’s membership of the Arab League, marking the start of a slow rehabilitation. HTS is rooted in al-Qaeda’s former Syria branch and has faced accusations of human rights abuses including torture. One anxious resident of Syria’s second city Aleppo, who declined to be identified, spoke of panic as the rebels overran it on Friday and Saturday. ‘There were terrible traffic jams — it took people 13 to 15 hours to reach Homs,’ he said. Normally, it would take just a couple of hours to reach Syria’s third city, which lies between Hama and Damascus, he added. A convoy of Kurds joined the exodus on Monday as Turkish-backed fighters seized areas east of Aleppo from Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, who control much of the northeast, an AFP photographer witnessed. But others remained trapped inside the rebel-controlled city. Nazih Yristian, 60, who lives in Aleppo’s Armenian neighbourhood, said he and his wife had tried to flee but the main road out had been cut. Since then, the couple have cloistered themselves at home, he said. ‘No one attacked us so far, but we want to leave until things calm down. We have been displaced a lot and we will be displaced again.’ Russian president Vladimir Putin and Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian pledged ‘unconditional support’ for their ally on Monday, according to the Kremlin. But Assad’s key allies have been distracted by the wars in Ukraine, and in Gaza and Lebanon respectively. Neighbouring Iraq too has expressed support and on Tuesday a pro-Iran group within the security forces called on the government to go further and send combat troops. A spokesman for Kataeb Hezbollah, part of the Iran-backed ‘axis of resistance’, said the group had not yet decided to deploy its own fighters but urged Baghdad to act. ‘We believe the Iraqi government should take the initiative to send regular military forces in coordination with the Syrian government, as these groups pose a threat to Iraq’s national security and the region,’ the spokesman said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/251924/army-resistance-toughens-as-rebels-near-syrias-hama
"BB okays Tk 3,000cr loan at 4pc interest for ICB","The Investment Corporation of Bangladesh has received approval from the Bangladesh Bank for a Tk 3,000 crore-loan at a reduced interest rate of 4 per cent, down from the initial 10 per cent. Two-thirds of the loan will be utilised for repaying the corporation’s existing debts, while the remaining amount will be invested in the capital market, said ICB chairman Abu Ahmed confirming the information on Tuesday. Earlier, on November 13, the government provided a sovereign guarantee to facilitate the loan. Based on this guarantee, the Bangladesh Bank issued a formal letter to ICB on November 27, sanctioning the Tk 3,000-crore loan at a 10 per cent interest rate with a tenure of 18 months. ICB later informed the Bangladesh Bank that the 10 per cent interest rate was unsustainable for the institution and requested a reduction to 4 per cent. Following the proposal, the central bank approved the loan at the revised interest rate. The financial support aims to strengthen ICB’s capacity to meet its obligations while bolstering investments in the capital market, aligning with broader economic stability goals, Abu Ahmed said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/251923/bb-okays-tk-3000cr-loan-at-4pc-interest-for-icb
IMF concerned over high inflation in Bangladesh,"The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday expressed deep concerns to the Bangladesh Bank over the persistently high inflation in the country. An IMF delegation met with Bangladesh Bank governor Ahsan H Mansur and other senior officials, where they highlighted the central bank’s struggle to rein in inflation, according to BB spokesperson and executive director Husne Ara Shikha. According to the IMF, average inflation surged to 11.6 per cent, far exceeding the target of 7.2 per cent. The IMF stressed the importance of maintaining a high policy interest rate for an extended period until inflation is brought under control. It also recommended increasing the already elevated policy rate further if necessary to curb inflation effectively. If the Bangladesh Bank adheres to such approach, inflation is projected to stabilise at 10 per cent by the end of 2025 and potentially decrease to the target level of 7 per cent by late 2026. Shikha claimed that the Bangladesh Bank had successfully met all the conditions and targets set by the IMF. However, the IMF recommended modernising the monetary policy framework to address systemic inefficiencies and ensure more effective inflation management. The disbursement of the next tranche under the ongoing $4.7 billion loan package is expected by December. So far, the IMF has disbursed $2.3 billion of the loan since 2023. Additionally, the Bangladesh government has sought an additional $3 billion in funding from the lender. On August 7, the IMF said that it would continue its ongoing $4.7 billion loan programme in Bangladesh despite the government change.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/251922/imf-concerned-over-high-inflation-in-bangladesh
Bashir for trade bodies’ capacity dev for graduation benefits,"Commerce adviser Sk Bashir Uddin on Tuesday said that Bangladesh needed to enhance the capacity of different business organisations and human resources to enjoy the benefits of LDC graduation. ‘It (LDC graduation) indeed marks a pivotal moment of economic status. As a result, to enjoy the graduation, we need to enhance capacity of different business organisations and human resources also,’ he said. The commerce adviser said this while inaugurating the three-day National Workshop on WTO Dispute Settlement at a city hotel. Presided over by commerce secretary Md Selim Uddin, director at legal affairs division of World Trade Organisation Jorge Castro spoke on the occasion while additional secretary, WTO Wing of the Ministry of Commerce Nazneen Kawshar Chowdhury made the welcome remarks. Jointly organised by the Ministry of Commerce and WTO, the workshop is supported by the Export Promotion Bureau and the FBCCI. Bashir also hinted that Bangladesh was poised to graduate from the LDCs in November 2026. Terming it as a ‘golden opportunity’ for all, the adviser said, ‘I think as the trade is evolving, more and more regime is evolving. So, the ideal word should be not to have any dispute...But, you will definitely have disputes,’ Since Bangladesh is graduating, Bashir said that on the front of country’s external trade, many issues would evolve while exporting something to the trade partners. ‘I think our exports are not diversified as our export basket is very depending on a single product,’ he added. The commerce adviser said, ‘As we graduate we need such soft skills to be able to sustain and to grow our trade volumes.’ He said that, after graduation, Bangladesh would engage in bilateral and multilateral negotiations to sign economic partnership agreement and comprehensive economic partnership agreement. ‘Moreover, we will engage with regional business groups such as, EU, SASEC and ASIAN and so on. Various disputes will arise during the negotiations with different countries and regional business groups,’ he added. The workshop focuses on basic characteristics of the WTO dispute settlement system, main actors of WTO dispute settlement system. Besides, it briefly discusses the WTO agreements, basic principles of GATT, decision making process and dispute related issues. The adviser hoped that the participants of this course will acquire knowledge of the role of WTO dispute settlement in the multilateral trading system, the main stages of WTO dispute settlement procedures, the role of complainant, a respondent and a third party in a WTO dispute and the dispute settlement issues. Furthermore, as a member of WTO, he said that Bangladesh had an interest in ensuring that the dispute settlement system of WTO remains the central element in providing security and predictability to the multilateral trading system. This is particularly important for developing countries including LDCs who benefits from having stability, constancy and predictability to both. Aftermath of this workshop, the commerce adviser said that the participants would be aware of the underlying structures and procedures and the application of rules. Officials from the Ministry of Commerce, WTO, different government organisations, representatives from business organizations, academician from different universities are taking part in the workshop.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/trade-commerce/251921/bashir-for-trade-bodies-capacity-dev-for-graduation-benefits
Experts urge for legal framework to boost tech-driven investments,"Experts on Monday called for enabling legal framework and enforcement practices in relation to data protection and intellectual property rights to foster technology-driven investments. At a roundtable organised by the American Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh on ‘FDI Ecosystem to boost sustainable economic growth’ at the Westin Dhaka, they emphasised the critical role of foreign direct investment in driving sustainable economic growth in Bangladesh. Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan, adviser to the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, said, ‘Bangladesh has immense potential for renewable energy deployment, and the government is taking initiatives to shape the future of the energy and power sector.’ He also highlighted the upcoming one-stop service platform to resolve business grievances and improve the ease of doing business. Lutfey Siddiqi, the chief adviser’s spe cial envoy on international affairs, said, ‘We are working with various ministries and regulatory bodies to develop a culture that supports foreign investment, not as regulators, but as facilitators.’ He encouraged continued dialogue to address challenges and improve the FDI environment. AmCham vice-president Eric Walker, also the president of Chevron, in his welcome note, said that continuity of policies, strong transparent institutions, simplified regulations, skilled workforce development and ongoing financial sector reforms were essential to attract and sustain investment and innovation. Derek Wong, vice-president of government relations at Excelerate Energy Bangladesh Limited, praised recent reforms in the energy sector and emphasised the sector’s potential for attracting foreign investment.

China curbs exports of key chipmaking components to US,"Beijing said Tuesday it would restrict exports to the United States of some key components in making semiconductors, after Washington announced curbs targeting China’s ability to make advanced chips. Among the materials banned from export are metals gallium, antimony and germanium, Beijing’s commerce ministry said in a statement that cited ‘national security’ concerns. Exports of graphite, another key component, will also be subject to ‘stricter reviews of end-users and end-uses’, the ministry said. ‘To safeguard national security interests and fulfil international obligations such as non-proliferation, China has decided to strengthen export controls on relevant dual-use items to the United States,’ Beijing said. ‘Any organisation or individual in any country or region violating the relevant regulations will be held accountable according to the law,’ it added. In its own latest curbs, Washington on Monday announced restrictions on sales, without additional permission, to 140 companies including Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier. They also impact Naura Technology Group, which makes chip production equipment, according to the US Commerce Department. The move expands Washington’s efforts to curb exports of state-of-the-art chips to China, which can be used in advanced weapons systems and artificial intelligence. The new US rules also include controls on two dozen types of chip-making equipment and three kinds of software tools for developing or producing semiconductors. Beijing swiftly vowed to defend its interests, saying the United States ‘abuses export control measures’ and has ‘hindered normal economic and trade exchanges’. And on Tuesday, China said Washington had ‘politicised and weaponised economic, trade and technological issues’ as it unveiled its own export curbs. The moves also restrict the exports of ‘dual-use items to United States military users or for military purposes’, Beijing said. China accounts for 94 per cent of the world’s production of gallium — used in integrated circuits, LEDs and photovoltaic panels — according to a report by the European Union published this year. For germanium, essential for fibre optics and infrared, China makes up 83 per cent of production. Beijing last year had already tightened restrictions on exporters of the metals, requiring them to provide information on the final recipient and give details about their end use. But the curbs unveiled Tuesday now ban them outright. It had also previously restricted curbs on exports of certain types of graphite —also key to making batteries for electric vehicles. ‘The move is clearly a retaliatory strike at the US,’ Dylan Loh, an assistant professor at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, told AFP. ‘It drives home an important point which is that China is not completely passive (and) there are some cards it can play and hit the US with as well with regards to chips,’ Loh added. These ‘back and forth curbs’ could create supply chain disruption, as well as inflationary pressures, should they affect trade for third parties, said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science from the National University of Singapore. But while the metals play critical roles in high-tech industries, they are upstream in the supply chain, which means their immediate impact on production ‘is limited’, Brady Wang, associate director at technology market research firm Counterpoint, told AFP. ‘As the US-China trade tensions have persisted for some time, many intermediary manufacturers in the supply chain have been stockpiling these materials,’ Wang added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/251918/china-curbs-exports-of-key-chipmaking-components-to-us
Initiatives to prevent bad IPOs taken: DSE director,"Dhaka Stock Exchange director Minhaz Mannan Emon on Tuesday said that initiatives had been taken to prevent low quality initial public offerings from entering the country’s capital market, according to a DSE press release. Minhaz said that many low quality IPOs damaged the capital market in the past 15 years. He made the remarks at a workshop organised by the DSE Training Academy for teachers and students of the Army Institute of Business Administration at Savar, on the outskirts of Dhaka. The DSE Training Academy organised the workshop as part of its capital market-focused academic education awareness series for teachers and students of public and private universities. Minhaz said that initiatives had been taken to prevent money laundering abroad, which would play an important role in the economic development of the country. ‘Financial literacy is very important before investing in the capital market. An investor should consider company performance, look at the profile of entrepreneurs and directors before investing,’ he further said. DSE independent director Mohammad Kamruzzaman, also the director general of the Army Institute of Business Administration, said that if more good-quality companies entered the capital market, the market would grow. ‘We hope that companies with good fundamentals will be listed in the future. The capital market is in a bad state due to the listing of several bad companies in the past,’ he added. Acting DSE managing director Sattique Ahmed Shah said, ‘This programme is a good opportunity to increase knowledge about the capital market.  It will help the participants in investing in the stocks.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/stocks/251917/initiatives-to-prevent-bad-ipos-taken-dse-director

BNP acting chair Tarique seeks limit on PM’s consecutive terms,"Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting chairman Tarique Rahman on Tuesday said no person should be the prime minister for more than two consecutive terms in the country. ‘I personally think that a person should in no way be the prime minister at least for more than two consecutive terms,’ he said while replying to a question from a student at a workshop held in BNP chairperson’s Gulshan office. Tarique Rahman, who joined the event through a virtual platform, said he firmly believes that it is not possible for an individual to work sincerely after a maximum of 10 years as the person might be physically and mentally exhausted. BNP Training Affairs Committee arranged the workshop titled ‘31-point state reform and public engagement’ for the private university students. In reply to another question, the BNP acting chairman said if BNP comes to power, it would not keep the provision of using symbols of political parties in the local body elections. Addressing the workshop, he spelled out his party’s thoughts and plans over the reform of the country’s structures and development of different sectors, including education, healthcare, agricultural, financial, environment, water and the commodity supply chain. Tarique put emphasis on the establishment of the political and economic rights of the people in the country. ‘If we can’t establish the political rights and economic rights of the people simultaneously, there’ll be no use of any reform, no matter how much we talk about reform,’ he said. The BNP leader said the political rights and economic independence of people must be established at any cost. ‘If so we’ll be able to implement all reform programmes gradually.’ About corruption, Tarique said the nation should be taken out of the culture of corruption. ‘We’ll have to curb corruption at anyhow and take the nation and the country out of it.’ He said there was a law during the last BNP’s regime that ACC won’t require to take any permission from the government to conduct an investigation against anyone. The ACC was independent. But the previous autocratic government changed this law and incorporated a provision to take prior permission from the government to carry out investigation against any government official or employee, he said. Raising his party’s thoughts about the future education system, he said they would increase the budget for the education sector and give emphasis on primary education by enhancing the quality of the teachers through proper training and recruiting meritorious teachers in primary schools. Besides, learning the third language alongside Bengali and English would be compulsory for the class VI-X students. The third language could be Italian, French, German, Mandarin, Arabic or Japanese. ‘I want to keep another language compulsory alongside Bengali and English,’ he said. He believes that if a worker with knowledge of a third language goes abroad, the person won’t face difficulty in availing a job there. The BNP acting chairman said if BNP comes to power, it would introduce family cards to give financial support to every family and farmer cards to provide support to actual farmers in the country. ‘There will be family cards for every family in the country. The card will be given against the name of the mother or wife in a family,’ he said. Citing an example, he said if the support of Tk 2,500 to Tk 3,000 will be given from the state for every family a month and the family could save some money, which would ultimately help make the family financially independent. About BNP’s plan about the agricultural sector, Tarique said they would try to discourage imported items and encourage local products. He said farmer cards will be given by preparing a database of the country’s actual farmers in order to provide fertilizers support and other facilities including crops insurance coverage and if possible, interest-free loans to the real farmers. About the healthcare sector, the BNP leader said his party will create tens of thousands of ‘Palli Chikishak’ (village physicians) to provide more than one physicians for every village as a project titled ‘Palli Chikishak’ was implemented during the regime of BNP founder Ziaur Rahman. Some 70-75 percent of the village physicians would be women as they have easy access to any house in a village and convince the women, he said. About the commodity market, Tarique Rahman said there is a problem in the essential commodity supply chain and this is extortion. ‘We must curb extortion,’ he said. It’ll have another supply chain alongside the traditional supply chain, he said, adding that normalcy should also be restored in the price-hike of essential items. About his party’s thoughts about the environment, the BNP leader said dredging canals and rivers would be one of their priorities. If BNP gets a chance to come to power, the canals and rivers would be dredged to make water reservoirs throughout the country and channel flood water, he said. Tarique Rahman said they would enhance the tree plantation to improve the environment.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251915/bnp-acting-chair-tarique-seeks-limit-on-pms-consecutive-terms

BFIU detects Tk134cr deposits in Munni Saha linked account,"The Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit has found Tk 134 crore of deposits in a bank account linked to journalist Munni Saha. The account, registered under M/S Promotions, an advertising firm where Munni Saha and her husband, Kabir Hussain Taposh, are beneficiaries, exhibited unusually high activity. Munni Saha is listed as the firm’s nominee, according to BFIU officials. The account, located at One Bank’s Karwan Bazar branch, was opened on May 2, 2017, under account number 0121020005989. Of the total deposits, Tk 120 crore was withdrawn, while the rest Tk 14 crore remains frozen. On October 6, the BFIU sought information about her deposits, loans, lockers, credit cards, foreign trade, or offshore banking accounts or any associated individuals or entities in banks where it found such transaction. M/S Promotions provides services such as promotional product design, advertising production, and marketing programme management. The company also received a Tk 18 crore loan from One Bank on June 6, 2017, which became overdue by January 2019. The loan was later renewed in November 2019, with the limit increased to Tk 25 crore despite repeated payment failures. After the payment failures, however, the amount was rescheduled in September 2022 for five years. In addition, unusual and suspicious transactions were found on different dates between One Bank’s Khatunganj branch client M/S Prime Traders and M/S Promotions despite having no business relations between them.

Munni Saha could not be reached for her comments about the allegations despite repeated attempts over the phone. BFIU officials suspected that Munni Saha accumulated huge assets during the Awami League regime.  She is now facing several cases on charges of murder and crimes against humanity committed during the recent anti-discrimination student movement. On Saturday, Tejgaon police station officer-in-charge Mubarak Hossain said that they rescued Munni Saha from Karwan Bazar area after she was surrounded by an angry crowd comprising leaders and activists of Jatiyatabadi Juba Dal, Shramik Dal and mass people. Police, however, released her on Sunday, after five hours. Munni Saha, a familiar television journalist and talk show host, began her career with Bhorer Kagoj. She then moved to Ekushey Television and later joined ATN Bangla. Munni Saha had been associated with ATN News since its inception but resigned from the media outlet in the past year.

South Korea president declares martial law,"South Korea’s president Yoon Suk Yeol on Tuesday declared emergency martial law, saying the step was necessary to protect the country from ‘communist forces’ amid parliamentary wrangling over a budget bill. ‘To safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea’s communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements I hereby declare emergency martial law,’ Yoon said in a live televised address to the nation. ‘With no regard for the livelihoods of the people, the opposition party has paralysed governance solely for the sake of impeachments, special investigations, and shielding their leader from justice,’ he added. The surprise move comes as Yoon’s People Power Party  and the main opposition Democratic Party continue to bicker over next year’s budget bill. Opposition MPs last week approved a significantly downsized budget plan through a parliamentary committee. ‘Our National Assembly has become a haven for criminals, a den of legislative dictatorship that seeks to paralyse the judicial and administrative systems and overturn our liberal democratic order,’ Yoon said. He accused opposition lawmakers of cutting ‘all key budgets essential to the nation’s core functions, such as combatting drug crimes and maintaining public security... turning the country into a drug haven and a state of public safety chaos.’ Yoon went on to label the opposition, which holds a majority in the 300-member parliament, as ‘anti-state forces intent on overthrowing the regime’ and called his decision ‘inevitable’. ‘I will restore the country to normalcy by getting rid of anti-state forces as soon as possible.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/251903/south-korea-president-declares-martial-law
Bangladesh shuts Agartala mission in India after attack,"The Bangladesh mission at Agartala in India was closed on security ground on Tuesday a day after it came under attack by a group of Indian protesters during a violent demonstration. Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Verma was summoned by the foreign ministry in Dhaka over the ‘heinous attack’ on its mission in Agartala, capital of Tripura state. ‘Given the security situation, all visa and consular services at the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission, Agartala will remain suspended until further notice,’ said first secretary and head of chancery Md Al Amin in a notice issued on Tuesday, adding that this came into effect immediately. This is for the intimation of all the visa and consular service seekers, according to the office order. In the presence of the members of the local law enforcement agencies, the Indian protesters on Monday vandalised the flag pole, desecrated the national flag of Bangladesh and also damaged properties inside the assistant high commission, according to the foreign ministry officials in Dhaka. Tripura has been witnessing widespread protests over the arrest and detention of a Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das, a former leader of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, in Chattogram on November 25. The violent demonstration and attack by a large group of protesters of the Hindu Sangharsh Samity on Monday afternoon on the premises of the assistant high commission of Bangladesh in Agartala of India drew widespread condemnations and protests here in Bangladesh. Indian high commissioner Verma, after attending the meeting with acting foreign  secretary Reaz Hamidullah on being summoned, said, ‘We are willing to engage with the interim government of Bangladesh.’ The Indian envoy on Tuesday also told the reporters that Delhi wanted to maintain constant, stable and constructive relationship with Dhaka. Terming the relationship between the two countries as ‘multifaceted and wide-ranging’, he said that India was interested to work with Bangladesh government to fulfill shared aspiration of the two neighbouring nations for peace, security and development. Chief Adviser’s Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam at a separate briefing at the Foreign Service Academy, said India was a big neighbour of Bangladesh and the government wanted good relations with the neighbour. ‘But the good relationship should be based on just and equity,’ he added. The Hindustan Times reported that Indian authorities have already arrested seven people and suspended four police officers for their alleged involvement in the attack on Bangladesh assistant high commission in Agartala. The Indian police on Tuesday said that  a case was filed against the suspects, including Jhutan Das (Golchakkar border), Ujjwal Das (Dashamighat), Diptanil Bhowmik (Abhoynagar), Surja Das (Amtali), Alak Majumder (SDO Chowmuhani), Pradip Saha (79 Tilla), and Jhulan Malakar (Belonia), read the report available online. Thousands of people on Monday held a massive rally in Agartala, demanding the immediate release of Chinmoy and stopping alleged attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh, reports The Economic Times on Monday. Protesters from the rally brought out a procession under the banner of Hindu Sangharsh Samity, an affiliate of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, and stormed into the Bangladesh assistant high commissioner’s office there having a workforce of only nine. All the employees of the mission office were left with insecurity after the protesters damaged properties inside the office and desecrated Bangladesh’s national flag, according to foreign ministry officials in Dhaka. The Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi maintains diplomatic representative offices in Agartala, Chennai, Mumbai, Guwahati and Kolkata. The Indian government, meanwhile, has upped the security of the Bangladesh diplomatic missions in India, the Indian media reported. Indian Hindus also took part in a protest outside the Bangladesh mission in Mumbai on Monday amid the unrest in Bangladesh after the arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das, Agence France-Presse reported. The professor Muhammad Yunus-led government has reaffirmed ‘in the strongest terms’ that every Bangladeshi, regardless of their religious identity, has the ‘right to establish, maintain or perform respective religious rituals and practices or express views without hindrance.’ Dhaka has deeply resented the violent demonstration and attack by the protesters of the Hindu Sangharsh Samity on the premises of the assistant high commission of Bangladesh in Agartala of India. ‘This particular act in Agartala stands in violation of the inviolability of diplomatic missions, as the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961, asks for,’ said the Bangladesh foreign ministry in a press statement on Monday. It said that all members of the assistant high commission were left ‘with a deep sense of insecurity.’ The government has already called upon the Indian government to take immediate action to address this incident, to undertake a thorough investigation into the incident and to prevent any further acts of violence against the diplomatic missions of Bangladesh in India, including the safety and security of the diplomats and the non-diplomatic members of staff and members of their families.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/251901/bangladesh-shuts-agartala-mission-in-india-after-attack

Australian tennis great Neale Fraser dies,"Australian tennis great Neale Fraser, who won 19 Grand Slam titles, has died aged 91, officials said on Tuesday as tributes poured in. The former world number one lifted three major singles titles, including Wimbledon in 1960, together with 16 Grand Slam doubles crowns.

Chevron for investing in gas exploration in Bangladesh,"Energy giant Chevron has planned to invest in new gas exploration activities in Bangladesh in an effort to boost the country’s energy security, senior officials of the United States-based company said on Tuesday. Chevron officials said that they were happy that the interim government had started clearing arrears worth hundreds of millions of dollars after the previous Sheikh Hasina government stopped paying the company in the past two years. Led by Frank Cassulo, a vice president of the company, Chevron officials called on Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus at the State Guest House Jamuna. Cassulo said that increasing gas demand due to growing economic activities and a better business outlook have prompted Chevron to invest in new drilling activities in northeastern parts of the country. ‘We will invest in new onshore gas exploration,’ he said, adding new gas reserves would boost the country’s economic growth. Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus welcomed Chevron’s move to explore new gas reserves, saying that the Interim Government has planned to increase gas supply to local companies amid an uptick in economic activities. ‘We are now ready for business. We welcome more foreign direct investment in the country. Major multinational companies have already responded positively,’ he said. The chief adviser highlighted key reforms undertaken by the interim government to ensure a better investment climate in the country. Yunus praised Chevron’s social responsibility activities for the local communities. Lutfey Siddiqi, the chief adviser’s special envoy, was present at the meeting.

Bangladesh qualify for Jr Hockey World Cup for the first time,"Bangladesh made history as they qualified for the Men’s Junior Hockey World Cup for the first time in history with a 7-2 win over Thailand in a place-deciding (fifth-eighth) match of the ongoing Junior Asia Cup 2024 at the Al Amerat Hockey Stadium in Muscat, Oman, on Tuesday. The Bangladesh Under-21 team will now face the winners between South Korea and China on Wednesday to decide whether they will finish fifth or sixth in the Junior Asia Cup, from where the top six teams will play in next year's 24-team Junior World Cup to be held in India. Bangladesh took the lead in the third minute, courtesy of a flick from Obaidul Hossain Joy before Amirul Islam converted a penalty corner in the sixth minute. Mohammad Abdullah made it 3-0 with a simple tap-in in the first minute of the second quarter before Thailand pressed hard to pull one back by converting a penalty corner on the stroke of half-time. After the resumption, Thailand showed signs of bouncing back, but Bangladesh silenced them by scoring three more goals through Mehedi Hasan Ovi, Saddam Khan, and Joy in the third quarter, while Thailand too scored another goal from a penalty corner.

Liquefied petroleum gas prices remain unchanged for Dec: BERC,"Price of liquefied petroleum gas remains the same for the month of December. According to Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission, the price of per kg LPG will remain at Tk 121.25 for the month of December as it was in November. The new prices will be effective from 6:00pm on Tuesday, December 3, 2024. BERC announced the new price, saying that a 12 kg LPG cylinder’s price remains unchanged. Prices of other sizes of LPG cylinders — from 5.5 kg to 45 kg — will go down accordingly, BERC said at a press briefing on Tuesday at its Dhaka office.

As per the BERC decision, the price of ‘auto gas’ (LPG used for motor vehicles) also remained at Tk 66.81 per litre (including VAT). The price of LPG, marketed by state-owned LP Gas Company, will also remain the same as it is locally produced with a market share of less than 5 per cent.

Bangladesh on top after Rana five-for against West Indies,"Nahid Rana's first Test five-wicket haul nudged Bangladesh ahead of the West Indies before the tourists' usually suspect batting line-up displayed a measure of resilience to claim the upper hand on the third day of the second and final Test at Sabina Park. Rana led the rout of the home side's first innings for 146 on Monday with impressive figures of five for 61, giving the visitors a lead of 18 runs. Buoyed by that effort, the Bangladesh top-order batting then displayed the sort of shot-making confidence previously unseen in this brief series to reach stumps at 193 for five in the second innings, a lead of 211 with five wickets in hand. Given that the highest successful run-chase in a Test match at Sabina Park is just 211, achieved by the West Indies against Sri Lanka in 2003, history would appear to be on the side of the tourists forcing a series-levelling victory over the final two days. Starting the day at 70 for one, West Indies were swiftly undermined by the 22-year-old Rana, who added four more victims to the dismissal of Mikyle Louis the previous evening. Rana was well supported by fellow seamer Hasan Mahmud (2 for 19). Keacy Carty top-scored with 40 while captain Kraigg Brathwaite, the first wicket of the day when he was caught in the gully off Rana, contributed 39. ‘We knew it was coming at some stage,’ said Bangladesh bowling coach Andre Adams. ‘When you bowl 150 k's (km/h) you are going to take wickets eventually. ‘We've got to look after him. That's why he didn't play in the first Test match. Luckily he has guys out there like Taskin (Ahmed) and Hasan as fellow seamers to keep him focused on the field.’ Bangladesh rallied from the early loss of Mahmudul Hasan Joy at the start of the second innings with 46 from Shadman Islam and a 39-ball 42 from captain Mehidy Hasan Miraz, who promoted himself to number four in the order, taking the initiative from a West Indies team which lost the plot in the final session when they insisted on ultra-aggression and paid the price with a succession of boundaries.

BNP expects India to respect democratic aspirations of new Bangladesh,"Denouncing the attack on the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala, Bangladesh Nationalist Party secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Tuesday expected that Indians would respect the democratic aspirations of the citizens of the new Bangladesh. ‘We hope that Indians would respect the democratic aspirations of the citizens of the new Bangladesh and help the trial of the Awami League fascist leaders who stay in India by sending them back to Bangladesh,’ he said in a statement.

Taking down the Bangladesh flag, setting it on fire and carrying out vandalism after entering the Assistant High Commission is a clear violation of the Geneva Convention, said the BNP secretary general. ‘We would request the government of India and the people of India that the use of hatred in Bangladesh as a tactic of your domestic politics will create lasting tension in the relationship between the two countries,’ Fakhrul added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251884/bnp-expects-india-to-respect-democratic-aspirations-of-new-bangladesh

The women were selected in five categories — Climate Pioneers, Culture and Education, Entertainment and Sport, Politics and Advocacy and Science, Health and Tech. RiktaAkter Banu was selected under Science, Health and Tech category. Rikta lives in a remote area of northern Bangladesh where having an autistic or disabled child is seen as a curse, according to BBC.

The Rikta Akhter Banu Learning Disability School now enrolls 300 students which made a positive impact on the community’s views about disability. While the school was initially built for children who are autistic or have a learning disability, it now caters for young students with a variety of intellectual and physical disabilities.Stranded astronaut Sunita Williams, rape survivor Gisele Pelicot, actress Sharon Stone, Olympic athletes Rebeca Andrade and Allyson Felix, singer Raye, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Nadia Murad, visual artist Tracey Emin, climate campaigner Adenike Oladosu and writer Cristina Rivera Garza are among the 100 women in the list. From facing deadly conflicts and humanitarian crises in Gaza, Lebanon, Ukraine and Sudan, to witnessing the polarisation in societies that followed a record number of elections around the world, women have had to dig deep and find new levels of resilience. BBC 100 Women acknowledges the toll this year has taken on women by celebrating those who — through their resilience — are pushing for change, as the world changes around them.

The survey also found that almost 71 per cent of the surveyed households faced corruption while getting service in 2023 and 50.8 per cent households had to pay bribes to get service. The TIB on Tuesday unveiled the Corruption in Service Sectors: National Household Survey 2023 on 15,515 households across the country at a press conference at its office at Dhanmondi in the capital.

Barisal Division reported the highest rates of corruption and bribery, with 82 per cent households affected by corruption and 61.9 per cent experiencing bribery. TIB executive director Iftekharuzzaman said that there were several tools available to combat corruption, but the lack of proper utilisation of the tools contributed to the persistence of high-level corruption. ‘It is usual that any sort of crime will turn institutional and spread its wings in the absence of punishment and surveillance,’ he said. He, however, expressed hope that during the interim government, examples of accountability would be set,   paving the way for better practices in the future. The survey revealed that service seekers paid Tk 10,902.3 crore in bribes to access services in 2023, which accounts for 0.22 per cent of the GDP for the financial year 2023-24.

End in sight to talks on pandemic treaty: WHO,"Countries trying to negotiate a global agreement on handling future pandemics began an extra week of talks on Monday, with the WHO chief insisting the end was in sight. The talks at the World Health Organisation’s headquarters in Geneva opened three years on from the decision to draft a new accord on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response taken in the heat of Covid-19 crisis. ‘You know your task and you know what is at stake,’ WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told negotiators for the UN health agency’s 194 member states. ‘You should be proud of what you have achieved in the past three years and you should also be confident that the end is in sight. It’s closer than you think. ‘I believe that you can finalise the pending issues before the end of this year,’ he added. Concluding an international agreement in little over three years would be exceptionally fast, given the typical glacial pace of striking treaties. While countries agree on the broad scope of what they want, the fine details remain in contention. ‘For the pandemic agreement to be meaningful, you need provisions of strong prevention, for continued preparedness, and for robust, resilient and equitable response,’ warned Tedros. ‘An imbalanced pandemic agreement is not an agreement.’ The one-week session is a resumption of the 12th round of negotiations, which lasted from November 4 to 15. Monday’s talks focused on research and development, sustainable financing, transfer of technology and know-how for the production of pandemic-related health products, prevention and surveillance, and on the heart of the agreement: the proposed pathogen access and benefit-sharing system. On Friday, countries will take stock and decide if they have made sufficient progress to call a special session of the World Health Assembly in order to adopt a finalised agreement. A special session of the WHO’s top decision-making body takes 35 days to arrange. On many minds is the return of Donald Trump to the US presidency on January 20. Trump is hostile towards the WHO. In his first term, he began pulling the United States out of the organisation, accusing it of being a puppet of China.

Summit’s FSRU remained offline in 6 out of first 9 months,"One of Bangladesh’s two floating storage and regasification units remained offline in six of the first nine months of this year, said a report released on Monday by the US-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. The FSRU, the offshore terminal to import liquefied natural gas, is owned by the Summit, which initially remained on routine maintenance in Singapore between January 22 and March 31, said the report titled ‘Floating LNG import  terminals post cost and climate challenges for Asian markets.’ On May 24, the FSRU halted operations due to Cyclone Remal, which brought wind speeds of 25-33 metres/second. The storm sent a steel structure crushing on the terminal, causing significant damage to the vessel’s hull, prompting the government to cancel four LNG shipments thereafter and sent the FSRU again to Singapore for repairs, the report said. Initially expected to resume operations within three weeks, unexpected damage to the subsea mooring system prevented engineers from reconnecting the FSRU upon its return from Singapore in early July. Flooding in eastern Bangladesh caused silt to turn seawater murky around the time, hampering underwater visibility and the reconnection process. The Summit Group said that the initial diving vessel used to fix the subsea equipment was unable to exert the force required, leading to the need to bring to the site a stronger vessel for the reconnection. The FSRU was finally reconnected on September 11 after 131 dives in challenging conditions with engineers from around the world, the report said. LNG deliveries to the terminal resumed on September 19. Cyclone Remal lasted four days, but the FSRU was offline for nearly four months, reducing the country’s gas supply and, in turn, causing outages at several gas-fired power plants. The storm killed at least 19 people and caused nearly Tk 7,000 crore in economic losses and damage, in addition to the Tk 2,600 crore demanded by the Summit – partly owned by Japan’s JERA and Mitsubishi – for contractual payments during the time the terminal was offline. ‘Stronger and more harmful weather events increasingly threaten the reliability of offshore LNG projects and the energy security of importing countries,’ said Sam Reynolds, a co-author of the report and the Research Lead for IEEFA Asia. Following the cyclone and recent political change in Bangladesh, the new interim government terminated Summit Group’s application for a second FSRU and rejected a bid by Excelerate Energy – the world’s largest FSRU owner – to build another vessel in the Bay of Bengal. Throughout Asia, 122 LNG terminals are under development, 22 of which are floating configurations. Nearly 90 per cent of the floating projects planned in South and Southeast Asia are in countries prone to tropical storms and typhoons or cyclones, including India, the Philippines, and Vietnam. New terminals in the Philippines have already faced weather-related operational challenges, while unfavorable conditions along Vietnam’s coast challenge the applicability of floating import configurations. Bangladesh imports LNG through another FSRU at Moheshkhali which began operating in 2018. Operations at the country’s first offshore LNG terminal were disrupted for months during the monsoon season in 2018. In 2021, the Summit LNG terminal was out of service for three months due to a damaged mooring line, resulting in gas shortages for power plants, industries and households. In May 2023, Cyclone Mocha shut down both of the country’s terminals, followed by maintenance work for the Moheshkhali terminal from November 2023 to January 2024. Both the LNG import terminals have a contract to receive $500,000 every day as regasification charge, not subject to the actual amount of gas handled. The regasification charge is reminiscent of the capacity charge awarded to private power plants, guarantying them hefty return irrespective of actual power produced. The IEEFA report said that the wind limit for connecting an LNG tanker to an FSRU may be less than 7.5m/s, while a cargo may be offloaded safely at wind speeds below 13m/s. The FSRUs require wave heights are below 2 metres to berth and unload LNG, and are unable to navigate if waves exceed 3.5m. Tropical depressions are characterised by wind speeds up to 17 m/s, while tropical storms can reach up to 33m/s. Wave heights from tropical storms vary due to a variety of factors. High average wind speeds throughout South and Southeast Asia are often cited as a boon for offshore wind energy potential, the report said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/power-energy/251867/summits-fsru-remained-offline-in-6-out-of-first-9-months-
"Ousted Bangladesh PM Hasina, 125 others sued for attempted murder","A case was filed against ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina and 125 others for attempting to murder a fish trader during the recent anti-discrimination student movement with chief metropolitan magistrate court in Dhaka on Monday.

Hamas says delegation discussed Gaza truce with Egypt,"A Hamas delegation discussed a ceasefire in Gaza with Egyptian intelligence officials, two officials from the Palestinian Islamist group said on Monday. The ‘delegation met with the head of the Egyptian general intelligence, Major General Hassan Rashad, and a number of Egyptian intelligence officials, and discussed ways to stop the war and aggression, bring in aid, and open the Rafah crossing’ at Gaza’s border with Egypt, said a senior Hamas official who was part of the Cairo meeting on Sunday evening. A second Hamas official  also present in Cairo said that ‘Egypt, Qatar and Turkey are making great efforts to reach an agreement for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange’. ‘Our Palestinian people are waiting for American and international pressure on Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stop the war and reach an agreement as happened in Lebanon,’ the official said. The meeting came shortly after Israel and Lebanese group Hezbollah agreed on a ceasefire in Lebanon with mediation from the United States and France. US president Joe Biden would launch a renewed drive for a ceasefire, his national security adviser Jake Sullivan said last week, adding Biden told his envoys to engage with Turkey, Qatar, Egypt and other actors in the region. Egyptian authorities did not publicly comment on any meetings with Hamas on Sunday. The first official said any deal Hamas agrees to should include the conditions the movement has brought forward since the start of the war. These include a full ceasefire, complete Israeli military withdrawal, unimpeded entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes, ‘a serious deal to exchange prisoners in one go or in two stages’, and reconstruction of the war-ravaged Palestinian territory. Israel has also repeatedly accused Hamas of delaying talks and not sincerely wanting to reach a deal. The Hamas senior official also said that ‘under Egyptian sponsorship’ the Hamas delegation met Sunday evening with a delegation from the Fatah movement, Hamas’s long-term rival currently in power in the occupied West Bank under the Palestinian Authority. He said that the meeting focused on ‘arrangements for the internal Palestinian situation and the management of the Gaza Strip once the war ends’. The talks aimed to agree on the shape of ‘an independent administrative committee to manage the strip and supervise aid, crossings and reconstruction, in agreement with all Palestinian factions’. Jamal Obeid, a member of Fatah’s leadership in Gaza, said that Egypt was making intensive efforts to stop the war. ‘The first priority is the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the return of the displaced, the opening of the crossings, relief for our afflicted people, and reconstruction under the management and supervision of the Palestinian National Authority,’ he said. Obeid said meetings in Cairo between Fatah and Hamas were crucial in order ‘to stop the war and put the Palestinian house in order’, and agree on what shape governance will take in Gaza after the war ends. Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel resulted in 1,208 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Israel’s retaliatory campaign has killed 44,466 people in Gaza, according to figures from the territory’s health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/251865/hamas-says-delegation-discussed-gaza-truce-with-egypt
Hefazat urges India’s action to stop disinformation against Bangladesh,"Hefazat-e-Islam on Monday refrained from marching towards the office of the Indian assistant high commissioner in Chattogram, despite earlier announcement. Instead, the organisation concluded its long march programme by submitting a memorandum to the Indian embassy through the Chattogram deputy commissioner Farida Khanam around 2:00pm. Earlier, on Friday, Hefazat-e-Islam’s joint secretary general, Mufti Harun Izhar, announced the long march towards the Indian assistant high commission office. On Monday, leaders and activists began gathering at the Jamiatul Falah Mosque premises in the city’s WASA area from 10:30am. Hefazat’s Chattogram city unit organised the rally where the participants were informed that the march had been postponed at the request of the government and law enforcement agencies. However, a brief procession started from the Jamiatul Falah Mosque and ended at Kazir Dewri intersection. From there, a 10-member delegation, led by Mufti Harun Izhar, proceeded to the DC’s office to hand over the memorandum. In the memorandum, Hefazat-e-Islam placed four demands to the Indian embassy such as halting false propaganda in Indian media about Bangladesh; ensuring responsible response by Indian political leaders; stopping interference by Indian intelligence in Bangladesh; strengthening bilateral relations between India and Bangladesh. During the rally, Mufti Harun Izahr emphasized Hefazat-e-Islam’s role in rebuilding Bangladesh, saying, ‘We are here today not out of emotion but with a sense of conscience. Hefazat’s struggle is for the reconstruction of Bangladesh. There can be no true progress in this country without Hefazat. To those in power, I ask, why do you speak only of fascism without addressing the Indian hegemony that enables it?’ He further claimed that, ‘Certain individuals, including Chimmoy, are conspiring with Indian funding to create unrest. These actions are part of a larger, well-planned effort.’ Referring to the intelligence agency requests to refrain from marching to the assistant high commissioner office, Izahr said, ‘When I announced the submission of a memorandum, some intelligence agencies became unusually active. Why this fear of India? They urged us to avoid a march, but our members are disciplined and educated. We pledged to submit our demands peacefully.’ Izahr also issued a warning to the Indian high commission, ‘Tell your government to end all anti-Bangladesh activities and rein in your politicians. Intelligence forces in India have even planned military actions against us. Bangladesh will not tolerate new agents or brokers acting in India’s interests. If India seeks peace, it must engage with us as friends.’ The rally, chaired by Hefazat-e-Islam’s Nayeb Ameer Ayub Babunagari, was also addressed by joint secretaries general Zafar Ahmed, Nasir Monir, and Mir Idris.

Public universities directed to hold cluster-based admission test,"The interim government’s education ministry adviser, Wahiduddin Mahmud, directed public universities to hold the admission test under the cluster-based system this academic year to keep order in the sector and avoid confusions. In a letter sent to the public universities under the cluster-based admission test system on Sunday, he also said that in future scope would be available to reform this system. The letter was issued after Jagannath University, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh and Khulna University of Engineering and Technology decided to leave the system citing problems including not getting meritorious students and session congestion. Jagannath University vice-chancellor professor Md Rezaul Karim said that they would take some more days for decision about holding the admission tests under the cluster-based system. Bangladesh Agricultural University vice-chancellor professor AK Fazlul Haque Bhuiyan, however, said that they would follow the directive of the adviser and hold the test under the system this year. In the letter, issued by the education ministry and addressed to the vice-chancellors of the public universities, Wahiduddin Mahmud said that if the universities left the cluster-based admission test system then it would become more difficult to bring back order in the higher education sector. At a meeting in the ministry, the vice-chancellors were gathered for discussion where reasons were given for keeping it as well as abolishing it, the letter continued. ‘There will be scope for reforming this method in future if necessary,’ the adviser said, adding, ‘In present circumstances, if the universities continue to take individual decision then confusion will be created among the students and their guardians.’ He said in the letter that they had also received some memorandums from some guardians and admission seeking students in favour of the cluster-based system. ‘Against this backdrop, I am requesting you to try as much as possible to follow the cluster-based admission test system for the academic year of 2024-2025,’ the letter concluded. Earlier on November 27, the education ministry had sought some more time from the public universities to take a final decision on continuing or scrapping the system. Most recently, the authorities of Jagannath University issued an advertisement to take a separate admission test for this year. The university’s vice-chancellor, professor Rezaul Karim, said that the decision of leaving the cluster-based system was taken at an academic council meeting. ‘So the decision to hold the test under the system will be taken at another academic council meeting,’ he added. Bangladesh Agricultural University vice-chancellor professor Fazlul Haque Bhuiyan said that as the government asked and for the interest of the country they would hold the admission test under this system this year. Seven agricultural universities held admission tests under the cluster system for the first time in the 2019–20 academic year with the aim of reducing sufferings of the admission seekers. In the 2020-21 and 2021-22 sessions, the universities in three clusters — general and, science and technology universities, agricultural universities, and engineering universities– held admission tests under the cluster system. According to the University Grants Commission, 24 general and science and technology universities, eight agricultural universities, and three engineering universities are scheduled to conduct admission tests this year. In the country currently there are 55 public universities. Five major public universities — Dhaka University, Chittagong University, Rajshahi University, Jahangirnagar University and the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology — decided not to join the system since the introduction.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251863/public-universities-directed-to-hold-cluster-based-admission-test

Drastic fall in Bangladesh-India flights amid visa restrictions,"The number of flights on different routes between Bangladesh and India has drastically fallen amid passenger shortages as the Indian government had imposed visa restrictions. The flights of Biman Bangladesh Airlines and US Bangla Airlines have halved after the fall of Sheikh Hasina government on August 5 amid a student-led mass uprising, according to officials of two airlines. According to the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport authority, four airlines—Biman Bangladesh  Airlines, US Bangla Airlines, Indigo and Air India—were operating flights on Dhaka-Kolkata, Dhaka-Delhi, Dhaka-Chennai, Dhaka-Hyderabad, and Dhaka-Mumbai routes. According to Biman Bangladesh Airlines’ weekly flight statistics, Dhaka-Kolkata flights have reduced to seven now from 14 in August, Dhaka-Delhi flights come down to two from previous seven, and Dhaka-Chennai flights reduced just one from seven in August. A director of Biman Bangladesh Airlines while talking to New Age put the drastic fall in flights down to India’s visa restrictions since the change in regime occurred in Bangladesh. Over 62.5 per cent flights of US Bangla Airlines have suspended due to lack of passenger shortage. US Bangla Airlines general manager Kamrul Islam said that they used to operate 32 flights on Dhaka-Kolkata, Chattogram-Kolkata and Dhaka-Chennai routes a week, which now came down to 12 after August 5 regime change. ‘Before August 5, we had run 14 flights on Dhaka-Kolkata route a week and now it’s only six. Chattogram-Kolkata flights, which were earlier seven a week remains suspended now,’ said Kamrul, adding that the weekly flights on Dhaka-Chennai route have come down to six from 11 since regime change. The passenger shortage was acute caused by visa restrictions by the Indian government. US Bangla officials said that the operation had closed since August. IndiGo flight departures are down to 45 in November from 62 in July, while arrivals during this period are now down to 44 from 64 in July, Times of India reports. Issuance of regular Indian visas from Bangladesh has remained suspended following the ouster of the authoritarian regime of Sheikh Hasina who fled to India on August 5 amid a student-led mass uprising. According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh officials, flight operations to India significantly fell due to passenger shortage. Civil aviation officials also said that people might have shown less interest in travelling to India alongside visa restrictions. Its chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Monjur Kabir Bhuiyan could not be reached over phone for comments. The situation has dealt a serious blow to the hotels, restaurants and healthcare services that served Bangladeshis especially in Kolkata, reports Indian media outlets.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/251857/drastic-fall-in-bangladesh-india-flights-amid-visa-restrictions
Fertiliser crisis worries Rajshahi farmers,"Along with the ongoing seed crisis in the peak of potato cultivation season, a shortage of fertilisers has added insult to injury to the northern farmers as they have to pay up to Tk 450 extra for per sack of fertiliser. Farmers blamed the syndicates of some dishonest dealers, traders, and agricultural officials and employees for the artificial crisis, leading to high prices. According to annual reports of the Department of Agriculture Extension and Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, a total of 106 lakh tonnes of potatoes were produced in Bangladesh in the past 2023-24 fiscal year, of which 79 lakh tonnes of the agricultural crop was produced in Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions. In the 2024-25 season, the agricultural officials have set a target of producing about 98.55 lakh tonnes of potatoes from 3.65 thousand hectres of land in the Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions alone. Farmers said that about two sacks of (100 kilogrammes) muriate of potash, also known as MOP, one sack (50 kilogrammes) of diammonium phosphate, also known as DAP, and one sack of triple superphosphate, also known as TSP, are required at the beginning of the potato of cultivation per bigha of land. According to the DAE Rajshahi divisional office, 14374 tonnes of MOP, 25,600 tonnes of DAP, and 9286 tonnes of TSP have been allocated in the Rajshahi agriculture region, comprising Chapainawabganj, Naogaon, Natore and Rajshahi districts, in the past month while about 15,897 tonnes of MOP, 31,288 tonnes of DAP, and 9,817 tonnes of TSP are to be allocated in December. The officials said that the government-set prices of MOP, DAP, and TSP fertilisers at the farmer level were Tk 1000, 1050, and 1350 respectively. Farmers, however, alleged that Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation and Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation dealers were charging them additional money up to Tk 450 per sack of fertiliser, owing to less allocation. Habibur Rahman, a farmer of Tanore upazila in Rajshahi, told New Age that he needed 30 sacks of MOP, 15 sacks of DAP, and 15 sacks of TSP fertilisers before planting potato seeds in his fifteen bighas of land. ‘After standing in a long queue for hours at a BCIC dealer shop, I could manage only a sack of MOP fertiliser at the government-set price,’ he said, adding that the same dealer was selling MOP at Tk 1200 per sack stating that he collected it from other sources. Visiting a BCIC dealer shop in Baya Bazar under Paba upazila in Rajshahi, this correspondent found MOP, DAP, and TSP fertilisers being sold at Tk 1180, 1300, and 1700 respectively against the government-set prices of Tk 1000, 1050, and 1350. An employee working at the shop told New Age that they had collected the fertilisers from other places as the BCIC allocation was too low against the farmers’ demand. ‘A total of 120 sacks of TSP was allocated to each of the dealers while a farmer alone needs over 200 sacks’, he added. Contacted, Rajshahi DAE deputy director Mst Umme Salma told New Age that they were trying their best to monitor the situation so that no dealer could charge additional money from the farmers. ‘If anyone lodges any complaint with us, we will take necessary actions instantly,’ she added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251856/fertiliser-crisis-worries-rajshahi-farmers
Railway employees’ movement disrupts train services,"Passengers continued to suffer for the second consecutive day on Monday as the running staff members of the Bangladesh Railway continued their movement for restoration of their previous benefits for working extra hours. Since Sunday the members, under the banner of the Bangladesh Railway Running Staff and Sramik Karmachari Samity, stopped doing additional duty except scheduled eight hours and stopped doing duty at rest. On Monday journeys of some trains were cancelled and many trains ran late behind their schedules, said the railway officials. A senior official of Bangladesh Railway said that on Monday from Dhaka journeys of 18 local trains had been cancelled. ‘The running staff members are not working in the way they should which disrupts our train schedules,’ he added. The union general secretary Md Mujibur Rahman told New Age that before 2022 they got special financial facilities under the Railways Act. The running staff members including locomasters, assistant locomasters and sub-locomasters have duty period of eight hours daily, but they had to work for an average 15 to 18 hours due to shortage of workforces, he said. Under the law, they got the mileage facility which meant that for every 100 kilometres of train run they received an additional amount of money equivalent to one day’s basic salary. Following this, if a working day is defined by an eight-hour shift, the running staff members work the equivalent of maximum three months of working days in a single month, Mujibur said, adding that before 2022 they had got salaries like that. They also got an additional 75 per cent of their pension higher than their basic salary, he continued. In 2022, the Finance Division cancelled these facilities and the running staffs started their movement demanding these facilities again. On Sunday, the union submitted a letter to the Bangladesh Railway director general office saying that they started a movement from the day to realise their demands. Mujibur Rahman said that they would continue their movement. As per the union, there are over 800 locomasters, assistant locomasters and sub-locomasters under the railway now.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251855/railway-employees-movement-disrupts-train-services
Tarique urges activists to work hard ahead of ‘toughest’ election,"Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting chairman Tarique Rahman has warned party leaders and workers that the forthcoming national election will be one of the toughest in Bangladesh’s history. ‘In my 30-35 years of political experience, it appears that although one of our main opponents is weakened, the next election will still be extremely challenging,’ he said. Addressing two workshops virtually on Monday, Tarique urged his party members to intensify efforts to garner public trust and support. The workshops, held in Mymensingh and Khulna, focused on BNP’s 31-point state reform proposal. Tarique noted that evolving public awareness, driven by social media and other factors, makes the election landscape increasingly complex. He emphasised that maintaining the public’s trust requires consistent engagement and aligning actions with their expectations. ‘The BNP believes its power comes from the people. Retaining their trust is our responsibility,’ he said. Tarique cautioned against complacency, urging party members to focus on earning support rather than assuming power prematurely. He called on leaders to correct past mistakes and to promote the party’s 31-point reform proposal, crafted in collaboration with other parties. ‘This outline reflects what we will do if we gain the public mandate. It’s essential to communicate this effectively to the people,’ he added. Tarique stressed prioritising moral education in schools to curb corruption and outlined plans for planting five crore trees, addressing water crises by digging rivers and canals, and enhancing women’s empowerment through social movements and support programmes. He observed that some BNP supporters developed an attitude as if they were already in power or about to come to power. ‘People recognise you as BNP, whether you belong to Chhatra Dal, Jubo Dal, Swechchhasebak Dal, or any other associated body. So, you must act in a way that ensures their support is for you and for the party in the future,’ he asked the party rank and file. Tarique said that the 31-point outline detailed what the BNP would do if it received the public mandate to govern the state. ‘Greeneries in the country, plants and trees have significantly decreased, with many old trees being chopped down over the last 16 years in the name of development. If the BNP gets the public mandate to run the country, they will aim to plant five crore rain trees and enhance greenery in the Sundarbans,’ the BNP leader said. Tarique said that a social movement was essential for further empowerment and for ensuring the dignity of female citizens in the country. ‘We will provide female members of poor families with a ‘family card’ offering various facilities. We will introduce farmers’ card, identifying genuine farmers to provide them with various benefits and financial support,’ he said. Tarique stressed the importance of placing great emphasis on imparting moral education to children in primary schools as a means to curb corruption. The BNP leader concluded by reiterating that the party’s future depends on the unity and conduct of its members, urging them to protect the party’s image and secure public trust at all costs.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/251854/tarique-urges-activists-to-work-hard-ahead-of-toughest-election
AL turned Bangladesh into kleptocratic state: Debapriya,"Economist Debapriya Bhattacharya on Monday said that a kleptocracy was established from crony capitalism in the past 15 years under the Awami League regime ousted by a student-people uprising on August 5. Politicians, businesspeople and civil and military bureaucrats established the kleptocracy, he said, highlighting the findings of the ‘White Paper on State of the Bangladesh Economy — Dissection of Development Narrative’ at a briefing at the planning commission in the capital. Debapriya, who headed the 12–member white paper committee, blamed the successive general elections since 2014 for the origin of the kleptocracy. To him, members of kleptocracy influenced and manipulated key facets of the economy to serve their vested interests, concealed by an illusory development narrative sustained by inflated and misleading data. The briefing was arranged a day after submission of the ‘White Paper on State of the Bangladesh Economy’ to chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on Sunday. Describing efforts by the members and support teams  over the past three months, Debapriya, also a distinguished fellow of Centre for Policy Dialogue, said that the report would be made public in printed form in a month. The paper stated that the country lost $16 billion annually on an average between 2009 and 2023 because of the illicit fund flow amid systemic tax evasion, misuse of exemptions, and poorly managed public finances under the AL regime. The white paper also highlighted that $14–24 billion was lost to political extortion, bribery, and inflated budgets with the annual development programme projects worth $60 billion in the past 15 years. Exploring the overall economy left behind by the AL regime, in 23 chapters, the 385-page white paper revealed that the banking sector was plagued by distressed assets of Tk 6.75 lakh crore as of June 2024, equivalent to the cost of constructing 14 Dhaka metro rail systems or 24 Padma Bridges. Despite the fragile economic situation identified as the middle income country trap by committee member and economist Zahid Hussain, Debapriya said that they opposed the deferral of graduation from the least developed countries’ block from 2026. He feared that such a decision might provide a political weapon to the ousted regime. Indicating Sheikh Hasina who fled to India on August 5, Debapriya said that statements might be issued that the interim government ruined the LDC graduation platform laid by the AL regime. Zahid Hussain narrated how the overstatement of the country’s gross domestic product by the AL regime had already put the country into a middle income country trap. Besides, the loan trap due to foreign loans on high interest rates for implementing non-viable projects will cause sufferings for the next generations, said Mustafizur Rahmnan, a member of the committee. Other committee members were also present at the briefing. Debapriya made five recommendations, including formulation of a two-year policy by the interim government, the next six-month outlook and meetings with development and lenders.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251853/al-turned-bangladesh-into-kleptocratic-state-debapriya-
"ICT orders production of Amu, Qamrul","The International Crimes Tribunal on Monday directed prison authorities to produce senior Awami League leaders Amir Hossain Amu and Qamrul Islam before the court on December 4. The case involves allegations of crimes against humanity, including killings and maiming and other violence, during the 36-day student-led anti-discrimination movement from July 1 to August 5, which culminated in the resignation of Sheikh Hasina as prime minister and her subsequent flight to India. The tribunal also ordered detention of two former Rapid Action Battalion officials, superintendent of police Mohiuddin Farooqi and former additional superintendent of police of Barishal Police Ranges, Alep Uddin. Both were arrested in a case filed on November 28, for their alleged involvement in enforced disappearances and torture that also contribute to crimes against humanity during the Awami League regime. The tribunal, led by Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder, along with Justice Md Shofiul Alam Mahmood and retired district judge Md Mohitul Haq Anam Chowdhury, issued the directives following petitions by chief prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam. On November 18, Qamrul was arrested by the detective branch of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police at Uttara. He was later shown arrested in connection with the murder of Abdul Wadud, a trader killed on July 19 during the student movement. Amir Hossain Amu, a member of the Awami League advisory council, was arrested earlier on November 6 in the same case. The ICT had issued arrest warrants earlier on October 17 for 46 prominent Awami League leaders, including Sheikh Hasina, in two separate cases.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251852/ict-orders-production-of-amu-qamrul
HC seeks update on BDR carnage probe body,"The High Court on Monday directed the government to submit a report on December 15 on the formation of a National Independent Investigation Committee to thoroughly investigate the February 25–26, 2009, massacre at the then Bangladesh Rifles headquarters. The directive came from a bench comprising Justice Farah Mahbub and Justice Debasish Roy Chowdhury after the government failed to meet the 10-day deadline set on November 5 for constituting the committee. The fresh order was issued during proceedings on a writ petition filed in public interest by Supreme Court lawyers Md Tanvir Ahmed and Biplab Kumar Poddar, who sought the formation of the committee. During the hearing, deputy attorney general Tanim Khan requested an additional week, as the proposal for the committee by the home ministry was still awaiting approval of the law ministry. The High Court expressed dissatisfaction at the government’s lack of progress in implementing its earlier directive. On November 5, the High Court had asked the government to explain why a National Independent Investigation Committee should not be formed to probe the BDR carnage. It also asked the government authorities to explain why they should not be directed to officially observe the February 25–26 as Shaheed Sena Dibash (Martyred Soldiers’ Day) to honor the victims of the massacre. Additionally, the court on November 5 had also issued an interim order directing the home ministry to resolve an application by petitioner Tanvir Ahmed within 10 days. The application proposed the formation of an independent committee to ensure a comprehensive investigation into the tragic incident. Over the course of two days, 74 people, including 57 army officers, were brutally killed. The incident occurred during the Awami League regime under Sheikh Hasina, who was later deposed on August 5, 2009, following a mass student-led uprising.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251851/hc-seeks-update-on-bdr-carnage-probe-body

Freezing of Bashundhara Group owners’ foreign assets ordered,"The Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge Court has ordered the freezing of multimillion-dollar foreign assets of Bashundhara Group chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan and his family in six countries and two offshore jurisdictions. The court passed the order on November 21 after hearing a petition filed by Anti-Corruption Commission deputy director Nazmul Hussain. It concluded that Sobhan and his family amassed huge wealth beyond their disclosed sources of income through illicit means and subsequently laundered the proceeds to locations, including the United Arab Emirates, Slovakia, St Kitts and Nevis, Switzerland, the British Virgin Islands, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Cyprus. The petition, detailing their foreign assets, sought a court order to freeze both movable and immovable assets of Ahmed Akbar Sobhan, his wife Afroza Begum, their sons Sayem Sobhan Anveer, Safiyat Sobhan, Safwan Sobhan, and Anveer’s wife Sabrina Sobhan, Sadat Sobhan’s wife Sonia Ferdowsi Sobhan and Safwan’s wife Yasha Sobhan for the sake of a proper investigation into the allegations of amassing huge assets. These assets include bank accounts, real estate, and business holdings. The order, issued under the Money Laundering Prevention Act 2012, will remain in effect until further notice, the court said. Copies of the court order were sent to the State Register of Slovakia, Citizens International of St Kitts and Nevis, Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Switzerland, British Virgin Islands ministry of financial services labour and trade, UK Department for Business and Trade, Singapore Exchange of Singapore, chairman of Habib Bank in the United Arab Emirates chairman, and chief executive officer of the ministry of interior and Department of Lands and Surveys of Cyprus for necessary action as per mutual legal assistance request. The court also ordered the publication of this order in the government official gazette along with widely circulated newspapers for information of the citizens. The court also asked its office to send the order to the secretaries of the ACC, the Public Security Division of the home ministry to communicate the order with Mutual Legal Assistance Request for subsequent actions in regard to execution of the order. The commission provided details of property acquired abroad in the name of Akbar Sobhan and his family to court. It said that its inquiry found that they took huge amounts of loans in the name of their companies from different banks, laundered a portion of the loans outside Bangladesh and purchased assets and invested in different companies in those countries and offshore havens. As Bangladeshi nationals, they were bound to apply to  the Bangladesh Bank seeking permission to transfer any capital outside Bangladesh, but they did not do so, the commission stated in the petition. Besides, they were bound to declare all legal incomes and assets in their income tax returns to the National Board of Revenue, but they did not do so, said the petition. Bashundhara Group managing director Sayem Sobhan Anveer obtained citizenship by investing 3 million euros in Slovakia and Yasha Sobhan spent 2 million euros to obtain citizenship in Cyprus. Ahmed Akbar Sobhan and his wife Afroza got citizenship by investing $25 million in St Kitts and Nevis, stated the petition. They and their sons and daughters-in-law invested in 19 companies in these countries and bought houses in Cyprus, it said. Safwan and Sonia Ferdowsi have opened bank accounts in Habib Bank in the UAE and Eurobank in Cyprus and transacted illegal money through the accounts, it stated. From the Habib Bank account of Safwan, 287.5 million euros were transferred to Sonia’s Habib Bank account which was remitted to Cyprus. They have $3,56,970 in their accounts, the petition stated. Sonia Ferdowshi Sobhan was beneficiary or shareholders or directors in a number of companies in British Virgin Islands that included Asimina Consulting Inc, Francatina Development Inc, Soms Group SA, Akebia United SA, Norea Holdings Limited, Evelina Lordanova Ivanova, Stat Holdings Services, Francatina Development Inc and Cordyline Universal SA, according to the commission. Besides, an investigation, conducted by The Observer in collaboration with the Transparency International, has revealed the information in a report published in the British daily Guardian on Sunday. The report stated that family members of Ahmed Akber Sobhan owne two vast properties in the United Kingdom, acquired for a combined £13 million and owned via companies registered in the British Virgin Islands, Golden Oak Venture Limited and Kaliakra Holdings Limited. A third, a French-style mansion, owned by one of Sobhan’s sons, appeared to be under construction, the Observer investigation found. One £10m mansion, on a gated estate in London’s Kensington, is owned by Sobhan’s son and Bashundhara Group vice chairman Safwan Sobhan, through a company named Austino Limited, it stated. A similar arrangement relates to a £5.6m Chelsea waterfront property owned by Safwan’s brother, at a cost of £28 million, it said. The apartment was purchased by Red Pine Trading, which is based in the British Virgin Islands but gives its address as a tower in Singapore, the report said. An investigation was under way against Akbar Sobhan and his family members and their interests in different companies under the Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2004 along with the Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2012. An average of $16 billion was illicitly siphoned off from Bangladesh annually between 2009 and 2023 amid systemic tax evasion, misuse of exemptions, and poorly managed public finances under the authoritarian Awami League, according to the White Paper on the state of Bangladesh Economy. The white paper was submitted to chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on Sunday by a 12-member committee headed by economist Debapriya Bhattacharya. The amount was more than double the combined value of net foreign aid and FDI inflows, it said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251849/freezing-of-bashundhara-group-owners-foreign-assets-ordered
"67 Chikungunya, 11 Zika cases reported in 2024: IEDCR","Bangladesh has recorded 67 cases of Chikungunya and 11 cases of Zika virus so far in 2024, according to a report of The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research. Halimur Rashid, line director of IEDCR, disclosed the information at a press briefing at Mohakhali in Dhaka on Monday. Abu Zafar, director general of the directorate general of health services was present. Abu Zafar said that 90 per cent of those infected with the Zika virus showed no symptoms and the mortality rate from the disease was zero. ‘However, we must remain vigilant about this matter as both Chikungunya and Zika viruses spread through Aedes mosquitoes,’ he said. He also urged all to remain aware about the two diseases and keep houses neat and clean. ‘There is no reason to be much worried over Zika and Chikungunya,’ he mentioned. Mentioning that the dengue cases and deaths were higher compared to other time of the year, the DGHS DG said that dengue was not being given proper attention, causing a rise in the number of fatalities. Dengue cases continued to rise during the period due to climate change. Patients infected with dengue did not come to the hospital unless the condition deteriorated and so they went into shock in a very short time, he said. The mortality rate was rising due to the delay in seeking hospital care, he added. ‘The highest number of deaths from dengue is recorded in Dhaka among people aged between 20 to 40 while in Chattogram, the mortality rate is comparatively higher among children than the elderly people,’ he explained.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/miscellany/251848/67-chikungunya-11-zika-cases-reported-in-2024-iedcr
Damascus takeover could change Middle East,"THE collapse of the Baathist government of Syria in the north of the country, as the al-Qaeda affiliate HTS (Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham or the Levant Liberation Council) advanced into Aleppo and Hama, could reconfigure the Middle East. The rapidity of the advance and the Muslim fundamentalist leadership of the fighters remind me of the fall of the government of Ashraf Ghani before the Taliban advance in August-September 2021. If those events embarrassed Joe Biden, these developments embarrassed Russian President Vladimir Putin, the main backer of Damascus. The distraction of Ukraine clearly weakened Russia in the Middle East, and may cost Putin one of his few clients in the region. The poor performance of the Syrian Arab Army troops at Aleppo shows again that for foreign patrons to stand up a friendly government and back a client army can often produce a Potemkin village, a facade with no reality behind it, which easily falls to pieces under some concerted pressure. This sort of disintegration afflicted the Iraqi National Army built by George W Bush, the Afghanistan National Army built by Bush, Obama and Trump, and now the Syrian Arab Army stood up by Vladimir Putin and Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. Indeed, a commander of the Quds Force (the special operations overseas branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps) and senior adviser to Syria, Brig Gen Kioumars Pourhashemi, was killed in the course of the HTS attack in northern Syria. Most Iranian media is in denial about the fall of Aleppo. The Syrian Baath government of Bashar al-Assad is as guilty as genocide as the Israeli government, having tortured to death some 10,000 people and having killed hundreds of thousands of innocents in its war to crush the Sunni rebel forces in the teens of the last decade. The rebel HTS also has innocent blood on its hands. The regional meaning of these events differs according to the lens through which they are viewed. If we view the victors as Sunni Muslim fundamentalist extremists, their ascendancy will be welcomed by President Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, who indeed may have a hand in the campaign, since he has been a patron of HTS. Erdogan has championed groups as diverse as the Muslim Brotherhood and the HTS, and while he is not himself a fundamentalist, he enjoys the soft power that accrues to Turkey from his support of groups such as Hamas, MB and others. The Turkish press is speculating that the four million Syrian Sunni refugees in Turkey might be able to return home if the Sunni rebels come to power. Likewise, Qatar, a regional champion of political pluralism that makes a place for political Islam, is a severe critic of the Baathist dictatorship, which wielded its secularism as a political cudgel. Most Sunni Muslims in Lebanon are anything but fundamentalists, but on the whole they will likely be happy about the collapse of the Baath, which they view as a totalitarian Stalinist knock-off in the hands of the Alawite Shiite sect, which discriminates against Sunnis. They are not wrong. In contrast, the Christians both in Syria (5 per cent of the population) and Lebanon (about a fourth of the population) are terrified today, given HTS’s past harsh record regarding religious minorities. From the point of view of the region’s nationalist, secular-leaning regimes, this movement is an unwelcome resurgence of radical political Islam. That is how it will be viewed by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Egypt, who has spent a decade crushing the Muslim Brotherhood, by Qais Saied of Tunisia, by Khalifah Hiftar, the strongman of East Libya, by President Abdelmadjid Tebboune of Algeria, by Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestine Authority, by the Democratic Union Party of the Syrian Kurds, and by Mohammed Bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates. Bin Zayed has spent his oil money trying to put down Muslim fundamentalists around the region, including in Libya and Sudan, and he is generally on the same page as al-Sisi. Bin Zayed spent some of Saturday on the phone with Bashar al-Assad discussing the events. As noted above, outside the region these events will alarm Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had shored up the al-Assad regime beginning in 2015 with air support from the Russian Aerospace Forces. From the point of view of those countries that feel threatened by Iran, the development will be greeted as a further sign of Tehran’s enfeeblement. Israel has humiliated Iran and its ally, Hezbollah, during the past four months, which may have emboldened the HTS to make this move. Bashar al-Assad’s Syria is one of Iran’s few firm allies in the Arab world, along with the Houthi government of Yemen, the Shiite-led government of Iraq, and the Hezbollah-influenced government of Lebanon. Syria is a key transit point for Iranian shipments of rockets and other munitions to Lebanon’s Hezbollah, and if it falls then Hezbollah — already on the ropes after Israel’s recent campaign against it — could face a bleak future. These anti-Iran forces include Israel, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Azerbaijan, and, outside the region, the United States. All are delighted at the news. In 2012–2016 during the Syrian Civil War, the US CIA funnelled billions to 40 Sunni Muslim fundamentalist groups in Syria, using Saudi intelligence as the pass-through. These groups were mainly Muslim Brotherhood affiliates and were vetted as “not al-Qaeda.” They were, however, close battlefield allies of the Succor Front (Jabhat al-Nusra), the leading organisation in the current HTS or Levant Liberation Council. So the CIA was again de facto allied with al-Qaeda in Syria, as it had been in Afghanistan in the 1980s. The prospect of the fall of Baathist Syria, however, is not without peril for these same countries, if al-Qaeda-adjacent forces come out on top. Would a wave of fundamentalist fervour in the region really benefit the bon vivant Mohammed Bin Salman of Saudi Arabia? Will the 800 US troops at Tanf in southeast Syria be threatened by the victorious HTS, given that those troops are in part a support for the leftist Kurds of Syria’s northeast that have fought it on many occasions? Indeed, if the Jabhat al-Nusra or Succor Front, an al-Qaeda offshoot, comes out on top in the new power struggle, even Turkey may come to regret these events. Erdogan has consistently underestimated the danger of groups such as HTS and ISIL, which have their origins in al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia and which split from one another in 2012. Despite its insouciance Turkey has been hit by ISIL bombings on several occasions. And, will Sunni fundamentalist militias marching into Damascus really be a good thing for the current extremist government of Israel, engaged in a genocidal campaign against Gaza that it justifies as an attempt to exterminate Sunni fundamentalist militias? The far right Likud Party’s theory that chaos in its neighbours is good for Israel may be tested.  InformedComment, December 1.

Bridging Cartesian roots with 4IR realities,"THE evolution of higher education over the past three centuries has been guided by the ideas of various philosophers, each contributing to distinct goals: cultivating reason, promoting individual growth, advancing society, and solving practical problems. Dominant philosophies like rationalism during the Enlightenment and pragmatism in the Industrial Age shaped education while coexisting with alternative viewpoints, resulting in a rich and diverse global trajectory. In the Fourth Industrial Revolution era, marked by rapid technological advancements and a highly interconnected world, revisiting these philosophical foundations is crucial to reimagining and adapting Bangladesh’s higher education to meet modern challenges effectively. While philosophers significantly shaped educational ideals, the two oldest universities — Al-Qarawiyyin (established in 859 in Morocco) and the University of Bologna (founded in 1088 in Italy) — emerged independently of direct philosophical frameworks. Al-Qarawiyyin, which began as a mosque, evolved into a hub of higher learning during the Islamic Golden Age. Its ethos was deeply rooted in the Islamic view of knowledge as both a spiritual duty and a societal obligation. While it later incorporated the works of thinkers like Aristotle, Ibn Sina, and Ibn Rushd, its foundation reflected the vision of Fatima al-Fihri, an Arab woman dedicated to fostering intellectual and educational growth within an Islamic framework. Conversely, the University of Bologna, influenced by classical thinkers like Aristotle and Cicero, Roman legal traditions, and mediaeval scholasticism, focused on law and a pragmatic approach to education aligned with societal needs and its philosophical context. In the modern era, René Descartes’ Cartesian philosophy had a profound impact on higher education, emphasising logic, reason, and systematic inquiry. Descartes’ distinction between the mind (‘thinking substance’) and the body (‘physical substance’) laid the groundwork for a rationalist model of education. His assertion, ‘Cogito, ergo sum’ (‘I think, therefore I am’), prioritised intellectual reasoning over sensory or emotional experiences, fostering an emphasis on deductive reasoning, analytical thinking, and disciplinary specialisation. While revolutionary at the time, this framework now struggles to address the demands of a globalised, technology-driven world. Over time, alternative philosophical approaches emerged to critique and complement Cartesian ideals. In the late 17th century, John Locke’s empiricist philosophy emphasised experiential learning, arguing that knowledge is acquired through sensory experiences and interaction with the environment. Locke’s Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1693) advocated tailoring education to individual contexts and societal needs, bridging intellectual and practical learning. The 18th century saw Jeremy Bentham’s utilitarian principles align education with societal good and practical utility, giving rise to vocational and professional programs. In the early 19th century, Wilhelm von Humboldt introduced the concept of Bildung, focusing on holistic personal development through critical thinking, creativity, and intellectual freedom. Humboldt’s integration of teaching and research, first implemented at the University of Berlin in 1810, laid the foundation for modern liberal arts and research universities. However, critics argue that Humboldt’s principles, developed for elite education, struggle to scale for mass education systems, which prioritise efficiency, standardised curricula, and employability. Additionally, his philosophy’s focus on theoretical knowledge often neglects practical, vocational, or market-oriented skills, leaving graduates less prepared for modern labour markets. The industrial era brought John Dewey’s pragmatic philosophy, which emphasised experiential learning and education’s integration with societal progress. Universities increasingly adapted to industrial and administrative demands, further entrenching disciplinary specialisation and standardised curricula. These century-old models, however, now struggle to keep pace with the transformative demands of the 4IR. Rapid technological advancements, automation, and global interconnectedness require reimagining higher education to prepare graduates for an unpredictable future. As routine tasks are automated, uniquely human traits — such as emotional intelligence, empathy, creativity, critical thinking, innovation, entrepreneurship, and adaptability — are becoming indispensable in complex, innovation-driven environments. Emotional intelligence and empathy are vital for effective communication and collaboration in diverse, globalised settings, while adaptive skills like problem-solving, resilience, and creativity are essential for thriving in a technology-driven world. These competencies, deeply intertwined with cognitive, emotional, and experiential dimensions, necessitate an education model that integrates all three aspects. Traditionally, higher education has been seen as a one-time process, preparing students for single professions, often aligned with industrial or bureaucratic roles. Today, careers are increasingly nonlinear, with individuals frequently changing fields or combining roles (e.g., engineers working in healthcare AI). Higher education must equip learners with adaptive skills to navigate this reality. This shift calls for moving beyond rigid, one-size-fits-all models to a dynamic, flexible, and learner-centred system that meets the challenges of the era of 4IR. Bangladesh is gradually embracing the 4IR, with advanced technologies slowly making their way into industries, services, and administration. At this critical juncture, the question of how higher education should evolve remains pressing. Given the education community’s reluctance to embrace major changes, a balanced approach integrating Cartesian and non-Cartesian models is essential. This strategy will equip graduates with the adaptive skills needed for the 4IR while fostering a workforce capable of addressing both local and global demands. Coordinated action is urgently required to meet this challenge, and the nation eagerly awaits its realisation.

Men’s role in fight against gender violence,"HOW many women in your life are affected by gender-based violence — your mother, sister, partner, or friend? What if we all took responsibility to protect them? Every day, millions of women live in fear — fear of physical abuse, emotional manipulation, and harassment. Gender-based violence is a silent epidemic, often hidden behind closed doors or disguised as cultural norms. What’s often ignored is that, in many cases, the perpetrators are the very men in their lives — partners, family members, or strangers. If we are serious about eradicating GBV, men must not only be held accountable for their actions but must actively participate in the solution. Without their direct involvement, the fight against GBV will remain incomplete. At its core, GBV is fuelled by toxic masculinity — a set of cultural norms that associates manhood with dominance, control, and aggression. These narrow definitions of masculinity harm women, but they also limit men. Men are often taught to suppress their emotions, avoid vulnerability, and assert power. These norms tell men that real strength lies in aggression, and anything softer is a sign of weakness. By rejecting these outdated ideas of manhood, men can help redefine masculinity in a way that empowers everyone. Real strength lies in compassion, respect, and equality. When men model these values, they become catalysts for change, helping to shift society’s broader attitude toward violence. Men’s involvement begins with listening to and supporting survivors of GBV. For too long, the burden of dealing with abuse has fallen entirely on the survivors, who are often dismissed or blamed when they seek help. Men can change this narrative by standing in solidarity with survivors, providing emotional support, and amplifying their voices. Supporting survivors is not just about sympathy; it’s about being actively present in their fight for justice. Men can help survivors access resources like legal and medical assistance, ensuring they are believed and treated with respect. This kind of active, empathetic support is crucial to dismantling the stigma that surrounds GBV. However, men’s influence extends far beyond individual interactions with survivors. Peer groups — whether in the workplace, sports, or social settings — hold tremendous power in shaping attitudes. When a man challenges a sexist joke or calls out harmful behaviour, he sends a powerful message that GBV is never acceptable. By speaking out in these moments, men can shift the cultural narrative. This isn’t about confrontation but about setting a new standard of respect. Every time a man intervenes, it creates a ripple effect that can change the behaviour of those around him. Men have the power to reshape attitudes by normalising respect and equality, making it clear that GBV is never acceptable. Perhaps the most crucial role men can play is in preventing violence before it begins. GBV doesn’t start with physical violence — it starts with control, manipulation, and the reinforcement of harmful gender norms. Men must be vigilant in identifying the early signs of abuse, whether in relationships or in their own behavior. Men have the ability and responsibility to intervene when they see unhealthy dynamics developing. Whether it’s calling out disrespectful behaviour or stepping in to prevent harassment, men must act when they see injustice. By intervening early, they can stop violence before it escalates. Additionally, men should support programmes that help rehabilitate perpetrators, teaching them to understand the root causes of their actions and offering them the tools they need to change. Men also have a significant role to play in modelling healthy relationships. In their homes and with their partners, men can practice equality, respect, and open communication. Healthy relationships are built on mutual support, not dominance. Men who share domestic responsibilities, communicate openly, and resolve conflicts without resorting to anger or violence set an example that challenges traditional gender roles. When men model healthy relationships in their personal lives, they send a powerful message to those around them. This isn’t just about private relationships; it’s about creating a culture of respect that can spread to every corner of society. Furthermore, men must advocate for educational reforms that teach boys and young men about respect, consent, and emotional intelligence. Programmes that engage young men in these discussions can help prevent harmful behaviours from taking root in the first place. It’s crucial to teach boys that vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness, and that respect and equality are the foundations of any relationship. Men have a responsibility to support these programmes and engage with the next generation to ensure that the cycle of violence does not continue. The challenge of ending GBV is not just about women; it’s about all of us. Men who take action to address GBV are not just contributing to a safer world for women — they are freeing themselves from the toxic constraints of traditional masculinity. Men benefit when they embrace vulnerability, empathy, and mutual respect. They break free from the narrow definitions of manhood that limit emotional expression and healthy relationships. When men reject harmful stereotypes and take active steps to prevent violence, they create a world where both women and men can thrive, free from violence and fear. Now is the time for change. Men must no longer stand on the sidelines in the fight against gender-based violence. The responsibility to end GBV lies with all of us, and men must take an active role in challenging harmful behaviours, supporting survivors, and advocating for systemic change. Every action, whether big or small, plays a crucial part in dismantling the toxic masculinity that fuels violence. By embracing equality, empathy, and respect, men can help shape a society where both women and men thrive, free from violence and fear. The path to a safer world begins with each of us. Speak out, take action, and make a difference today.

Urban centres like Dhaka and Chattogram have seen rapid urbanisation and industries such as garment exports have bolstered national revenue. Yet, the white paper raises a key question: who is truly benefiting from this growth? Unfortunately, the data paints a troubling picture. Despite the impressive GDP figures, real wages for agricultural workers and low-income earners have grown by less than 2 per cent annually between 2016 and 2022. Meanwhile, the richest 10 per cent of Bangladeshis control over 40 per cent of national income, while the bottom 50 per cent share less than 15 per cent. These figures mirror patterns seen in India, where the top 1 per cent of the population owns over 40 per cent of the country’s wealth. Economic theory highlights the importance of inclusive growth. According to Simon Kuznets’ hypothesis, inequality tends to rise in the early stages of economic growth but should decline as a country invests in social welfare and education. Unfortunately, Bangladesh seems stuck in the first stage, with wealth concentrating at the top and limited investments in reducing inequality. Keynesian economics further explains how this imbalance smothers consumption — the primary driver of demand — when most of the population lacks sufficient purchasing power. Learning from Vietnam, a nation with similar economic foundations, offers valuable insights. Vietnam prioritised rural development and vocational training, reducing its poverty rate from 58 per cent in 1993 to less than 6 per cent by 2022 while maintaining export-driven growth. Bangladesh must adopt similar strategies by channelling more investments into rural infrastructure, small businesses and skill development programmes to ensure that growth benefits everyone.  Inflation: a heavy burden on the poor INFLATION, particularly in food prices, remains a significant challenge for Bangladesh. In 2024, rice prices in Khulna rose from Tk 45 a kilogram to Tk 65 a kilogram and cooking oil in Sylhet exceeded Tk 200 per liter. For low-income families, who spend over 60 per cent of their earnings on food, these price hikes are crippling. While global factors like rising fuel costs have contributed to inflation, local issues such as market monopolies worsen the problem. A few large corporations dominate essential goods markets, keeping prices artificially high even when global costs stabilize. This looks like the situation in Pakistan, where sugar and wheat cartels manipulate markets, leading to frequent food crises. Inflation, combined with stagnant wages, wears away the purchasing power of millions, creating a dangerous economic environment. Brazil, in the 1990s, tackled similar issues effectively by introducing targeted subsidies for essential goods and enforcing strict anti-monopoly laws. Bangladesh could adopt these measures, alongside price controls on critical commodities during crises, to protect vulnerable populations. Strengthening supply chains to reduce transportation and storage costs would also make goods more affordable.  Corruption: an obstacle to development THE white paper highlights corruption as a persistent drain on Bangladesh’s economy. An estimated $16 billion leaves the country annually through illicit financial flows, more than double the combined foreign aid and foreign investment Bangladesh receives. Public projects often suffer from inefficiency and inflated costs, with the Rampal Power Plant being a prime example of delays and overruns. Even the Padma Bridge, now a success, faced criticism for budget mismanagement and cost and time overruns. This aligns with principal-agent theory, which explains how public officials (agents) misuse resources entrusted to them by citizens (principals). Corruption not only wastes resources but also discourages foreign investors who demand transparency and efficiency. Singapore, once plagued by corruption, transformed itself by creating strong anti-corruption institutions like the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau. Bangladesh can take similar steps by empowering its Anti-Corruption Commission with independence and resources. Adopting open contracting platforms, as seen in Ukraine, can also ensure greater transparency in public procurement.  Public debt: borrowing for growth or stagnation? Bangladesh’s public debt has risen to 40 per cent of GDP, up from 34 per cent in 2019. While this level is not immediately alarming, the way the borrowed funds are spent raises concerns. Much of the debt is used to service existing loans rather than fund productive investments, with debt repayments consuming over 20 per cent of government revenue in 2023. This leaves little room for critical sectors like education and healthcare. Large projects such as the Dhaka Metro Rail, while beneficial, often exceed their budgets, reducing their long-term economic value. According to crowding-out theory, high public debt can limit private sector investment by increasing borrowing costs, posing risks to job creation and economic stability. Rwanda, despite its limited resources, offers a model for managing public debt wisely. By focusing on healthcare, education and infrastructure, Rwanda ensures its borrowing directly boosts productivity. Bangladesh should adopt a similar approach, prioritising high-return investments and negotiating better terms for loans from institutions like the World Bank.  Education and healthcare: investing in people Bangladesh’s spending on education remains at a miserable 2.1 per cent of GDP, far below the global average of 4–6 per cent. This leaves many young people, particularly in rural areas, unprepared for the modern workforce. Similarly, healthcare spending is inadequate, with rural clinics often lacking doctors, medicines and basic equipment. Vietnam increased its education spending to 4.3 per cent of GDP, focusing on rural schools and vocational training, which helped create a skilled workforce. Cuba, known for its healthcare model, uses mobile clinics and community health workers to provide services in even the most remote areas. Bangladesh must adopt similar strategies, increasing spending and ensuring equitable access to these fundamental services.  Agriculture: an untapped potential AGRICULTURE, which employs nearly 40 per cent of Bangladesh’s workforce, remains underdeveloped. Farmers in Rajshahi and Barisal rely on outdated methods, limiting productivity and income. Climate change exacerbates the problem, with floods and droughts disrupting farming cycles. Bangladesh should provide subsidies for modern equipment, invest in agricultural research and development and establish farmers’ cooperatives, as seen in Denmark, to boost productivity and incomes.  The road ahead THE white paper is a roadmap. It highlights the urgent need for Bangladesh to address corruption, inequality and inefficiency and to invest in its people and industries. Examples from countries like Vietnam, Brazil, Singapore and Rwanda show that these challenges are not impossible to overcome. Bangladesh stands at a crossroads. By focusing on inclusive policies, smart investments and greater transparency, the nation can build an economy that is not only larger but also fairer and more resilient. The stakes are high, but so are the rewards. The time to act is now.
