Reform should include marginalised groups’ voice,"The voices of the marginalised and vulnerable groups including women, low-income households, people with disabilities, third- and trans-gender, and minorities should be included in the reform for good governance, experts said on Sunday. At the Citizen’s Conference 2024, held at the Bangabandhu International Conference centre in the capital, they also said that these groups should be engaged in policymaking through systemic change. The two-day conference titled ‘People-centric reform for good governance aspirations of disadvantaged communities’ was organised by Citizen’s Platform for Sustainable Development Goals, Bangladesh with support from the United Nations Development Programme, Bangladesh and Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. Debapriya Bhattacharya, the platform convener and distinguished fellow of Centre for Policy Dialogue, said in the context of the July mass uprising that the governance of the country did not change with the change in the government. He said that those who were kept behind must be brought in the mainstream in future and their voices must be heard. Attending the conference as chief guest, chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed said that the people’s principles of judgement and values of justice had been destroyed and distorted under the judicial process in the past years. He said that the judicial system had already started institutional reforms and the community-based judicial system must be strengthened for empowering citizens at the grassroots level. Lamiya Morshed, principal coordinator for SDG affairs, said that the interim government inherited a broken system of institutions and economy and therefore launched a series of reforms. ‘We have to rebuild that we hope will bring sustainable change to prevent a regression back to old broken and corrupt systems,’ she added. UNDP Bangladesh resident representative Stefan Liller said that for a long time voices of the women, youths, persons with disabilities, poor, minorities, and other marginalised groups had been sidelined in Bangladesh and now was the time for inclusion. Corinne Henchoz Pignani,  chargé d’affaires of Switzerland embassy in Bangladesh emphasised the inclusion of all voices, an organised education system, dialogue and a governance reform agenda centred on aspirations of the people at this ‘crucial juncture’. On the first day of the conference, Jahangirnagar University professor Nurul Huda Sakib presented ‘Localism for leave no one behind groups’ rights: a proposed social protection governance model,’ American International University-Bangladesh senior assistant professor Faria Sultana presented ‘Citizen-led oversight: empowering marginalised communities for equitable public service delivery’ and Dhaka University professor Asif M Shahan presented ‘Breaking the iron triangle of policy making: empowering marginalised groups in realising rights.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252356/reform-should-include-marginalised-groups-voice
India urged to accept August 5 reality,"Foreign adviser Md Touhid Hossain at a discussion on Sunday said that the relations between Bangladesh and India underwent a qualitative change following the August 5 regime change, and that the change must be acknowledged in order to move the relationship forward. The SAARC Journalist Forum Bangladesh organised the seminar at the National Press Club to mark the 40th Charter Day of the SAARC. ‘To solve any problem, we must first admit the existing problem. Similarly, we must also acknowledge that there has been a qualitative change in our relationship after August 5. We must acknowledge this and work towards moving our relations forward,’ said Touhid while speaking as chief guest of the event. He said that the current strain relations were not only impacting Bangladesh but also India, a much larger economy. Bangladesh Nationalist Party vice-chairman Abdul Awal Mintoo said that his party doesn’t want the relation with neighboring country to deteriorate. Demanding revitalising the SAARC, he said that it was crucial for regional cooperation and prosperity. ‘We have nothing like SAARC for regional prosperity,’ he said. Strategic expert Brig Gen (Rtd) Hasan Nasir admitted that the SAARC had a huge scope for trade and economy, but the tension of Indo-Pak rivalry, terrorism, border issues and refugee were challenge in the moving forward. The New Nation former editor Mostafa Kamal Majumder spoke among others at the event presided over by SAARC Journalist Forum Bangladesh president Nasir Al Mamoon and moderated by its executive committee member Rafiqul Islam Azad.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/252355/india-urged-to-accept-august-5-reality

"PMI grows on agri, manufacturing, service sectors","The Bangladesh Purchasing Managers’ Index increased by 6.5 points to surpass 60 points in November, indicating economic growth for the second consecutive month after a period of contraction over the previous three months, according to a report. The Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Dhaka, and the Policy Exchange Bangladesh published the PMI November report on Sunday. However, the country continued to face domestic challenges due to uncertainties linked to political processes and disruptions caused by industrial and other protests, the PMI report observed. The latest PMI reading attributed the growth to a faster rate of expansion in agriculture, manufacturing, and services sectors. However, the construction sector reverted to a contraction. The PMI index is measured on a scale of zero to 100. Compared with the previous month, a score above 50 indicates economic expansion, while a score below 50 signifies contraction. A score of exactly 50 means there has been no change in activity in the respective sector during the month. The agriculture sector posted its second consecutive month of expansion and at a faster rate. Growth was driven by faster rates in the indices of new business and business activity. Although the employment index experienced a slower contraction, the order backlogs index posted a faster contraction. The manufacturing sector recorded its third month of expansion, with an accelerated growth rate. Expansion was noted across several indices, including new orders, exports, factory output, input purchases and input prices. For the first time, expansion was also recorded in finished goods, imports, employment and supplier deliveries indices. Meanwhile, the order backlogs index saw a slower rate of contraction. After a marginal expansion in the previous month, the construction sector returned to contraction. The sector reported contraction in indices of input costs and order backlogs, while new business, construction activity and employment indices showed growth. The services sector recorded its second consecutive month of expansion, with a faster growth rate. Faster expansion was seen in indices of new business, business activity and order backlogs. The input costs index rose at a slower pace, and the employment index shifted back to expansion. The future business index highlighted faster expansion rates in key sectors such as agriculture, construction and services. However, the manufacturing sector experienced a slower expansion rate. The November PMI report underscored a mixed but optimistic outlook for the economy, driven by positive performances in key sectors despite enduring challenges related to domestic political uncertainties and disruptions.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/252353/pmi-grows-on-agri-manufacturing-service-sectors
"Salehuddin urges industrialists to invest in education, research","Finance adviser Salehuddin Ahmed on Sunday urged industrialists to invest in education and research to bridge the gap in skilled manpower and knowledge in the industrial sector. The adviser made these remarks as chief guest at the celebration ceremony of the Graduate Diploma in Leather, Leather Goods and Footwear Management programme of East West University held at EWU campus in the city, said a press release. Salehuddin Ahmed emphasised that successful figures like Bill Gates and Elon Musk did not achieve their innovations solely by themselves; their success was built on long- term investments in research. He highlighted the irony that while business leaders in Bangladesh often complain about the lack of skilled manpower, they did not invest in educational and research institutions. The event was presided over by chief adviser of EWU and former governor of the Bangladesh Bank Mohammed Farashuddin. Other distinguished speakers included resident representative of the Asian Development Bank in Bangladesh Hoe Yun Jeong, vice-chancellor of EWU Shams Rahman, senior vice-president of the Leathergoods and Footwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association of Bangladesh Mohammed Nazmul Hassan, additional secretary of the Finance Division Mohammed Walid Hossain and professor of the Department of Business Administration of EWU and programme director of the Graduate Diploma in Leather, Leathergoods and Footwear Management Programme Tanbir Ahmed Chowdhury. The ceremony was attended by EWU diploma graduates, faculty members, Officers from different sections, officials from the Ministry of Finance, and representatives from the Asian Development Bank, among others.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/252352/salehuddin-urges-industrialists-to-invest-in-education-research
RMG makers facing banking challenges: study,"The country’s apparel makers are facing significant challenges in banking processes, particularly with issues related to raw material imports and export proceeds receipts, according to a study. The most pressing concerns include delays in opening letters of credit, high bank charges and payment receipt delays, which are disrupting trade operations, Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies research director Monzur Hossain said while releasing the study. The study findings presented on the second day of the four-day Annual BIDS Conference on Development 2024 at the Lakeshore Hotel on Sunday. It showed that a staggering 40 per cent of surveyed firms reported delays in opening LCs as key bottleneck, hampering supply chains. Three per cent of them faced difficulties in opening LCs due to the dollar crisis. Sixteen per cent of respondents expressed concerns over delays in receiving payments, which impacted their cash flow and operational continuity. Thirteen per cent reported that higher charges were adding to operational costs. The study ‘Supply chain dynamics for sustainable RMG growth in Bangladesh’ conducted on 63 medium and large garment factories revealed that on average 38 per cent of the firms sourced raw materials such as yarn, fabric, chemicals, trims and accessories domestically. Another 24 per cent relied on intermediaries or third parties for international sourcing, while the remaining 38 per cent directly sourced from international markets, the study found. In terms of recommendations, 46 per cent of respondents suggested reducing bank transaction costs or charges, while 22 cent called for the use of TT payments. Other recommendations included establishing precise exchange rates for the dollar, standardising LC charges across banks, reducing taxes and adopting advanced technologies. Some also stressed the importance of increasing domestic sourcing to avoid banking complications. Monzur highlighted the challenges faced in timely sourcing of raw materials from foreign suppliers. He suggested that direct marketing and eliminating intermediaries could help improve supply chain efficiency by meeting lead times, avoiding air shipments and preventing order cancellations. Addressing the impact of Bangladesh’s post-LDC graduation, Monzur said that the country would lose its duty-free market access to developed markets, including the European Union. Citing the reference of previous studies, he said that Bangladesh’s RMG exports could face duties ranging from 7 per cent to 14 per cent, and the sector could see a decline of 10.8 per cent in exports by 2031. The total exports might decrease by 6 per cent, it mentioned. The study suggested strengthening backward linkages by expanding fabric production capacity, which would enhance the competitiveness of the RMG sector. BIDS research director Kazi Iqbal also presented findings from a study titled ‘Technology upgradation of the RMG industries in Bangladesh’, which examined eight products, 36 processes and 136 sub-processes across 43 firms. The study revealed that as the industry became more capital-intensive, the number of factory workers per machine had decreased over time, particularly affecting machine operators and helpers. The last decade saw significant capacity expansion, along with a rise in technical professionals, including BSC and Diploma textile and industrial engineers, it found. The study said that there was also an increase in the use of software, direct exports and certification, reflecting improved firm capabilities. Investment in research and development has been higher for certain products such as home textiles, lingerie, sweaters, woven shirts, and trousers. Productivity has increased across various sub-processes, with the highest gains in jackets, home textiles and lingerie, the study mentioned. The study also said that the share of female workers in the labour force decreased from 56 per cent in 2014 to 53 per cent in 2023, with a significant drop in the jacket sector. The study also noted that higher capital intensity had both displaced and reinstated workers. Another study presented at the conference found that a 50-per cent increase in the adoption of advanced technologies, such as automation, could lead to the elimination of 17.57 lakh manufacturing jobs in Bangladesh. The study ‘How would technological progress impact employment in the manufacturing sector of Bangladesh? An empirical projection’ analysed the potential impact of technological advancements on the country’s labour force, estimating job losses under three scenarios: a 15-per cent increase in technological efficiency, a 30-per cent enhancement and a 50-per cent adoption of advanced technologies. The findings painted a stark picture of the challenges ahead for apparel and textile workers in the face of rapid automation and innovation. The study identified apparel sector as the most affected sector. It projected potential job losses of 2.55 lakh at a 15-per cent productivity increase, rising to 6.51 lakh for a 50-per cent increase in the apparel sector. According to the study jointly presented by Dhaka University economics department assistant professor Mahtab Uddin and the BIDS research associate Farhin Islam showed that textiles could be the second hardest hit manufacturing sector with up to 2.95 lakh jobs at risk under a 50-per cent technology upgradation. The study mentioned that the non-metal products sector could see up to 4.34 lakh under a 50-per cent increase in technological efficiency. Similarly, the food production sector, known for its reliance on manual labour, faces potential job cuts of up to 1.14 lakh the leather and leather goods industry could lose up to 45,697 jobs, pharmaceuticals sector, despite being less labour-intensive, may see 34,145 jobs displaced. The furniture industry could lose up to 36,317 jobs as technological improvements in wood processing and assembly reshape production processes, the study said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/apparel/252351/rmg-makers-facing-banking-challenges-study
"US clean energy, defence to be impacted by China export curbs","China’s retaliatory export controls could take a toll on the growing US clean energy sector and its defence industry, analysts say, as a trade tussle escalates between the world’s two biggest economies. Beijing announced this week it would ban exports of gallium, germanium and antimony to the United States, targeting materials used for everything from semiconductors to solar cells. China also tightened restrictions on graphite, which is key to the electric vehicle industry. The moves, which Beijing said were to safeguard national security, swiftly followed Washington’s own curbs to hobble China’s ability to make advanced computer chips. While trade tensions have been simmering, US president-elect Donald Trump’s arrival at the White House in January is likely to ratchet up the temperature on trade — with the Republican already vowing sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports. Analysts say it would take time to assess the impact of the new Chinese curbs on US industries, though any immediate hit should be limited. Some see Beijing’s moves as symbolic for now, even as ramifications depend on how China enforces the new rules. ‘This certainly could drive up costs,’ said Arun Seraphin of the National Defence Industrial Association. ‘It could create situations where you can’t produce what you need.’ ‘It’s certainly going to drive a lot of uncertainty for companies who want to plan out their supply chain,’ he told AFP. China is a major producer of the three metals in question. In August, it unveiled export controls on some antimony products and since then, shipments have plunged. Restrictions announced in 2023 on gallium and germanium also hit exports to the United States. ‘Gallium, germanium, and antimony are vital inputs for defence technologies,’ said Gracelin Baskaran and Meredith Schwartz of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in a recent analysis. Gallium and germanium are increasingly preferred over traditional silicon for high-performance chips used in defence applications, CSIS added. It noted these materials have properties that boost device performance, speed, and energy efficiency. Antimony is used in fireproofing and has defence-related uses, too. While China is investing in munitions and buying high-end weapons systems more rapidly than the United States, the US industrial base lacks capacity to meet defence tech production needs, the report warned. ‘Bans on vital mineral inputs will only further allow China to outpace the United States in building these capabilities,’ it said. The US Geological Survey estimates that if China’s net exports of gallium and germanium were completely restricted simultaneously, US GDP could decrease by $3.4 billion. Besides defence, gallium-based semiconductors are used in radio frequency electronics, LEDs for lighting and high-efficiency solar cells, the US Geological Survey noted. Although gasoline vehicles do not call for graphite, electric vehicles (EVs) require an average of 136 pounds (61.7 kilograms) of the material, CSIS said. This could prove dicey for the United States, which has spurred billions in private sector investments for its domestic EV supply chain through subsidies via the Inflation Reduction Act. The act is a package of energy transition policy and social reforms under President Joe Biden. Seraphin told AFP that although Washington also pushed to attract investment and build up US semiconductor manufacturing capacity through the CHIPS and Science Act, these efforts do not yet target components such as germanium. Beijing’s retaliation this week steps up the restrictions on gallium and germanium announced in 2023 — as China hit back at previous US semiconductor export controls. ‘The industry was likely somewhat surprised by the swiftness of the imposition of a broader ban, but has been conditioned over the past year to expect some restrictions,’ Paul Triolo of Albright Stonebridge Group told AFP. He noted that China’s commerce ministry had already implemented a licensing regime around these key minerals, including ‘rolling three-month licenses to try and prevent stockpiling.’ While there has been some effort to stockpile minerals like graphite and gallium, this does not appear to be coordinated between US authorities and allies to reduce reliance on China over the long haul. It will be tricky to create capacity for processing and producing products based on these minerals outside China, Triolo believes, due to costs and regulatory challenges. ‘Companies are reluctant to enter these markets without long-term guarantees of subsidies, given the dominance of Chinese firms,’ he said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/252350/us-clean-energy-defence-to-be-impacted-by-china-export-curbs
TikTok closer to US ban after losing court appeal,"TikTok edged closer to being banned in the United States after it lost an appeal on Friday against a law requiring the video-sharing app to divest from its Chinese parent company by January 19. The potential ban could strain US-China relations just as president-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office on January 20. TikTok said it would now appeal to the Supreme Court, which could choose to take up the case or let the circuit court’s decision stand. ‘The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans’ right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,’ the company said. TikTok will also be looking to Trump, who has emerged as an unlikely ally, arguing that a ban would mainly benefit Facebook parent company Meta’s platforms, owned by Mark Zuckerberg. Trump’s stance reflects broader conservative criticism of Meta for allegedly suppressing right-wing content, including the former president himself being banned from Facebook after the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot by his supporters. The US government alleges TikTok allows Beijing to collect data and spy on users. It also says TikTok is a conduit to spread propaganda, though China and app owner ByteDance strongly deny these claims. The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, would block TikTok from US app stores and web hosting services unless ByteDance sells the platform by January 19. While recognising that ‘170 million Americans use TikTok to create and view all sorts of free expression,’ the three-judge panel unanimously upheld the law’s premise that divesting it from China’s control ‘is essential to protect our national security.’ They found that the law did not hinder free speech as it was ‘devoid of an institutional aim to suppress particular messages or ideas.’ The judges also disagreed with the idea that less drastic alternatives than a sale by ByteDance would solve the security issues. US Attorney General Merrick Garland welcomed the decision saying ‘the Justice Department is committed to defending Americans’ sensitive data from authoritarian regimes that seek to exploit companies under their control.’ Trump’s support for TikTok marks a reversal from his first term, when the Republican leader tried to ban the app over similar security concerns. That effort got bogged down in the courts when a federal judge questioned how the move would affect free speech and blocked the initiative. Among those who helped Trump to the White House in this year’s election was Jeff Yass, a major Republican donor with ByteDance investments. ‘Donald Trump could be a lifeline for TikTok once he takes office, but halting the enforcement of the ban is easier said than done,’ said Emarketer lead Analyst Jasmine Enberg. ‘And even if he does manage to save TikTok, he’s already flip-flopped on his stance toward the app and there’s no guarantee he won’t go after it later.’ The president-elect launched his own TikTok account in June, gaining 14.6 million followers, but has not posted since Election Day. Despite the uncertainty, TikTok’s presence in the United States continues growing. The platform reported $100 million in Black Friday sales for its new shopping venture, and Emarketer projects US ad revenue will reach $15.5 billion next year, accounting for 4.5 per cent of total digital ad spending in the country. But Enberg warned a ban would significantly disrupt the social media landscape, benefiting Meta, YouTube, and Snap while harming content creators and small businesses dependent on TikTok. Gautam Hans, professor at Cornell Law School, said the judges treated the government’s national security argument ‘with great deference... while undervaluing the radical effects this unfortunate decision will have for individual speakers and First Amendment doctrine.’ But given the unanimous ruling and the short timeline before the law’s date of taking effect, it was ‘unlikely that the Supreme Court will take the case, which will almost certainly lead to TikTok’s demise in just a handful of weeks,’ he added. In contrast, Carl Tobias, of the University of Richmond, said that given the ‘critical implications’ of the issues in question — national security and free speech — the apex court would likely take the case.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/252349/tiktok-closer-to-us-ban-after-losing-court-appeal
Georgia’s outlook cut to negative by Fitch,"Fitch Ratings downgraded Georgia’s outlook to negative from stable on Friday, citing sharply increased political risks following disputed October parliamentary elections that have sparked widespread protests in the Caucasus nation. The ratings agency maintained Georgia’s long-term foreign currency rating at ‘BB’ but warned that ongoing political turmoil could undermine investor confidence and pressure the country’s external finances. The move comes as pro-EU opposition parties have refused to recognize election results that saw the ruling Georgian Dream party secure 89 out of 120 parliamentary seats. Opposition groups have vowed to boycott parliament amid allegations of electoral fraud. Adding to tensions, Georgia’s government recently announced a postponement of EU accession talks until at least 2028, despite constitutional obligations to pursue membership and overwhelming public support for European integration. ‘Political risks are likely to remain very high,’ Fitch said, noting that ‘a protracted political crisis could undermine the institutional framework and affect investor and domestic confidence.’ The agency highlighted concerning economic indicators, including a 13 per cent drop in international reserves to $4.1 billion in October — equivalent to just 2.1 months of current account payments, well below the median for similarly-rated countries. Despite these headwinds, Georgia’s economy has shown resilience, posting 10 per cent growth in the first 10 months of 2024. Fitch projects growth will end the year at 8.7 per cent and moderate to 5.3 per cent in 2025 as political uncertainties weigh on the outlook. More trouble is expected after December 14, when Georgian Dream lawmakers elect a loyalist to succeed pro-Western President Salome Zurabishvili. She has vowed not to step down until the parliamentary polls are re-run.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/252348/georgias-outlook-cut-to-negative-by-fitch
Rio Tinto’s Bougainville mine poses ongoing threats: report,"A long-abandoned Papua New Guinea mine once operated by Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto poses environmental and safety concerns for nearby communities, who live under the threat of landslides, a new report shows. A two-year study of the Panguna mine — located on the autonomous island of Bougainville — found that mine structures had ‘deteriorated’, while ‘tailings continued to migrate downstream and chemicals continue to be released’. The Rio Tinto-commissioned study, conducted by environmental firm Tetra Tech Coffey, found that in some areas, buildings, bridges or the ground itself were ‘unstable and may collapse’. This poses the risk of harm, injury or death to the local community, according to the report. The mining giant has for years been accused of sidestepping responsibility for cleaning up poisonous waste at the vast mothballed copper and gold mine. Rio Tinto’s Australian chief executive Kellie Parker said the ‘comprehensive assessment’ marked an important milestone in understanding the long-term impacts of the mine. ‘While we continue to review the report, we recognise the gravity of the impacts identified and accept the findings,’ she said in a Friday statement. Parker acknowledged it would take time, but vowed to work closely with stakeholders to ensure the legacy of the mine was addressed in a ‘fair and equitable manner’ for impacted communities. The report found that tailings from the mine — which run into the Kawerong-Jaba River — had ‘permanently changed the river system’ and it would not ‘naturally return to how it was before the mine for at least 100 years’. The river system also posed a risk to the communities’ health and high metals in soil that made plants difficult to grow, the report said. But there were still some water sources that people could safely drink, bathe and swim in. The report made 24 recommendations, including outlining areas that need further investigation, which will be considered by relevant stakeholders to determine the next steps. Australia’s Human Rights Law Centre, which helped organise legal action against Rio Tinto, said communities continued to live with the ‘devastating impacts of the mine’. ‘Mine infrastructure is crumbling, putting lives at risk. Villages are being flooded and communities cut off from access to water and essential services,’ the centre said in an update on its website. It vowed to continue working with the community. The mine is estimated to still hold more than five million tonnes of copper and 19 million ounces of gold — worth billions of dollars at current market prices. The Panguna mine, which operated between 1972 and 1989, was one of the South Pacific’s largest mines. But anger among locals over the environmental damage and distribution of profits triggered an uprising that forced its closure. The ensuing civil war left up to 20,000 people dead — about 10 per cent of Bougainville’s population at that time. As part of a 2001 peace agreement that ended the civil war, Bougainville voted overwhelmingly to gain independence from Papua New Guinea.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/252347/rio-tintos-bougainville-mine-poses-ongoing-threats-report
Germany sees surprise drop in factory output in Oct,"German factory output suffered a surprise drop in October, official data showed Friday, underlining the persistent troubles faced by Europe’s biggest economy. Output fell by one per cent month-on-month, according to seasonally adjusted data published by the Destatis agency. That follows a two-per cent drop in September, according to adjusted figures released by Destatis. Analysts consulted by financial data firm FactSet had expected factory output to rebound in October, rising by one per cent. ‘Instead of the widely expected recovery from the sharp drop in the previous month we have seen another setback,’ said Elmar Voelker, an analyst at the LBBW bank. A steep drop was recorded in October in energy production, which fell by 8.9 per cent month-on-month. Likewise, in Germany’s flagship auto industry, which has struggled in the face of high costs and foreign competition, output fell by 1.9 per cent. Overall, output in October was 4.5 per cent lower than in the same month last year. The economy ministry said industrial activity in Germany was ‘continuing to slow’. Other recent indicators ‘also do not suggest a durable reversal of the trend in the German economy’, the ministry said in a statement. Germany’s economy grew by just 0.1 per cent in the third quarter, less than expected, and the government predicts a contraction of 0.2 per cent over the whole of 2024. ‘Looking towards next year, the early signs are not any better given the threatened trade war with the USA, Germany’s most important trade partner,’ Voelker said. The tariff rises mooted by US president-elect Donald Trump could knock as much as one per cent off Germany’s GDP, according to the president of the German central bank.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/252346/germany-sees-surprise-drop-in-factory-output-in-oct
US trade deficit narrows in Oct as imports fall,"The US trade gap narrowed more than expected in October, government data showed Thursday, as imports slipped more than exports. Trade imbalances in the world’s biggest economy are anticipated to become a focal point of president-elect Donald Trump’s second administration as he returns to the White House in January. Trump has pledged to lower US trade deficits and in his first term from 2017-2021 engaged in a bruising tariffs war with the world’s second-biggest economy, China. Overall in October, the US trade gap was down 11.9 per cent to $73.8 billion, from a revised level of $83.8 billion in September, said the Commerce Department. Behind the trend was a $14.3 billion drop in imports to $339.6 billion, the report said, with decreases seen in areas ranging from semiconductors to crude oil and consumer goods. US exports also dipped though by a smaller amount of $4.3 billion to reach $265.7 billion in the month. Declines in goods exports, such as those of autos, consumer goods and industrial supplies contributed to the trend, the Commerce Department added. ‘A narrowing trade deficit supports national income growth, and GDP growth too,’ economists at High Frequency Economics (HFE) said in a note. They added that this outcome is positive for economic indicators. ‘However, the decline in export volumes is a drag on industrial production and services output,’ HFE said. The economists also warned that the future of bilateral trade with China ‘is unclear as trade sanctions are piling up already’ even before the incoming Trump administration takes charge of trade policy. Among countries and regions, the US goods deficit with the European Union and Vietnam both decreased. Weeks before he takes office, Trump has already threatened steep levies on neighbors Canada and Mexico, and on competitor China.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/trade-commerce/252345/us-trade-deficit-narrows-in-oct-as-imports-fall
"Russian economy shows signs of slowdown, top banker warns","The Russian economy is showing ‘significant’ signs of a slowdown in some sectors as it grapples with waning growth and high inflation, the head of the country’s biggest lender warned Friday. Russia’s central bank has taken interest rates to a two-decade high of 21 per cent as Moscow battles to stem the economic fallout from its military offensive on Ukraine and a barrage of Western sanctions. Inflation is running at more than twice the government’s four per cent target, in part due to huge spending on the offensive, while the value of the ruble has slumped in recent months. ‘We are now seeing significant signals of economic slowdown, particularly in housing construction and investment,’ German Gref, the CEO of state-run Sberbank, was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies at an investor forum. He cautioned the central bank against ‘overshooting’ on its rates policy, making it ‘harder to return to the rails of economic growth’. The regulator is set to decide on borrowing costs at a meeting on December 20, with some analysts suggesting the bank could hike interest rates to as high as 23 per cent. Russia has massively ramped up military spending on its Ukraine offensive — expenditure that has helped the economy defy predictions of a lengthy recession, but also led to deep labour shortages and persistent inflation. Central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina has called interest rates a ‘powerful instrument for the fight with inflation’. But economists say that because inflation is being driven by record state spending on the Ukraine conflict, higher borrowing costs have less of an impact on reining in price rises than in a more market-based economy.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/252344/russian-economy-shows-signs-of-slowdown-top-banker-warns
AB Bank MD Tarique Afzal resigns,"Tarique Afzal has resigned as managing director of AB Bank, citing health reasons, according to AB Bank officials. They said that he resigned while he was on leave and staying abroad. Syed Mizanur Rahman, an additional managing director of the bank, has been given current responsibility of the MD position. Afzal joined AB Bank as a deputy managing director in 2018 and was promoted to MD in July 2019. His resignation has come at a time when the bank is grappling with serious financial challenges, including allegations of corruption and mismanagement by senior officials and unethical advantages taken by sponsor-directors. The bank’s non-performing loans surged to Tk 10,115 crore, accounting for 31 per cent of its total loan disbursements of Tk 32,625 crore, in September 2024 compared with those of Tk 5,940 crore in September 2023. Afzal’s tenure also saw his political involvement as a member of the Awami League’s international subcommittee. Following the government’s change in August, he left for Canada on a 15-day leave in the past month.

Keeping faith in bowlers pays off for Jr Tigers,"Bangladesh Under-19 cricket team captain Azizul Hakim said that keeping faith in his bowlers paid off in their 59-run victory over India in the ACC U-19 Asia Cup final at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium in the UAE on Sunday. Bangladesh was bowled out for just 198 runs in 49.1 overs, but the low total couldn’t deter their spirit. The junior Tigers clawed back strongly by dismissing India for 139 runs in 35.2 overs to retain the title. The pacers, who were instrumental throughout the tournament, stood up for Bangladesh in the final as well. Right-arm pacer Iqbal Hossain Emon took three vital wickets, whereas captain Azizul wrapped it up with the figures of 3-8 with his off-spin. Emon was adjudged player of the final for his figure of 3-24 from seven overs. The right-arm pacer also won the player of the match award with the figures of 4-24 when Bangladesh blew away Pakistan in the semi-finals. In the final, Emon first broke the crucial partnership between captain Mohammed Amaan and KP Karthikeya by dismissing the latter. Nikhil Kumer became his second victim one ball later. And in his next over, Emon scalped the wicket of Harvansh Pangalia. Emon dented the Indian middle order heavily, and they couldn’t recover from that. In fact, all the pacers did their jobs beautifully. Two other pacers, Al Fahad and Maruf Mridha, made early inroads by dismissing the Indian openers. ‘I was confident with our bowling. You saw it in the semi-finals that they’re capable. So I was confident with our bowling side,’ said captain Azizul, who was seen wrapping the national flag around his back in the presentation ceremony. Azizul also revealed what their plan was against the Indian batting line-up, who chased down 173 runs in just 21.4 overs in their seven-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the semi-finals. ‘Indian batters are very good, but they may have been struggling with scoring on the off side,’ said Azizul. ‘So I and our coach planned that we would hit the fourth stump line.’ Azizul’s counterpart Amaan also admitted that the lack of a big partnership cost them in the final. ‘Wickets fell at regular intervals,’ said Amaan. ‘We do have a lot of depth in our batting but couldn’t make big partnerships.’ It was all a festive occasion for the Bangladesh side, though, as they got the lion’s share of the support from the spectators on the ground. ‘I just want to say to all the supporters and the people back in Bangladesh that, Thank you. We appreciate all the support,’ said the Bangladesh captain. The Bangladesh captain also said that they would now turn their focus onto the U-19 World Cup, which is scheduled to be held in Zimbabwe and Namibia in 2026. ‘We’re now a positive and happy side,’ said Azizul. ‘Insha’allah we will do good in the World Cup.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252340/keeping-faith-in-bowlers-pays-off-for-jr-tigers

Damascus embassy of Iran vandalised,"Iran’s embassy in Syria was vandalised on Sunday, an AFP photographer said, after Islamist-led rebels declared the fall of Tehran ally Bashar al-Assad following a sweeping offensive that culminated in Damascus. The AFP photographer saw ransacked offices, with shattered glass on the floor and broken furniture in the building in Damascus’s upscale Mazzeh area, also home to other embassies and United Nations offices. People loaded looted items onto trucks outside, the photographer said. Filing cabinets and drawers sat open while papers, files and other contents, including Iranian and Syrian flags, were strewn around the premises. A safe sat in the middle of one room, whose tiled floor was littered with broken posters including of the Islamic republic’s founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and current supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the AFP photographer saw. Also on the ground was a destroyed picture of Lebanon’s former Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs in September, and of Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani, who died in a US drone strike in the Iraqi capital Baghdad in January 2020. ‘Unknown individuals have attacked the Iranian embassy, as you can see in these images shared by various networks,’ an Iranian state television broadcaster said, showing footage from Al Arabiya, said to be from the diplomatic compound. Iranian newspaper Tehran Times reported online that Iranian diplomats had left the embassy before it was stormed, citing foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei. The report accused rebel forces of being behind the attack, a claim that could not be independently verified immediately. Later Sunday, Baqaei said in a statement that Tehran has taken the ‘necessary measures’ to ensure the ‘security and safety of the employees of the embassy’. He added that ‘the ambassador and employees are in perfect health’. Online footage verified by AFP showed men outside the embassy overnight, tearing down a poster showing Nasrallah and Soleimani. On Saturday, as the rebels pressed their lightning offensive but had not yet taken Damascus, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called on ‘the Syrian government and legitimate opposition groups’ to enter negotiations. Araghchi visited Damascus on December 1, days into the rebel offensive, meeting with Assad in the Syrian leader’s last public appearance alongside an Iranian official. A day later, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian reiterated Tehran’s support in a telephone call with Assad. The deposed Syrian leader last visited Iran in May, shortly after the death of former president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash. Iran has supported Damascus during Syria’s civil war, which began in 2011, sending ‘military advisers’ at Assad’s request. Numerous Iranian Revolutionary Guards commanders have been killed in Syria, in combat and in Israeli strikes.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252338/damascus-embassy-of-iran-vandalised

Celebrations across Syria as Assad flees,"Celebrations erupted around Syria and crowds ransacked President Bashar al-Assad's luxurious home on Sunday after Islamist-led rebels swept into Damascus and declared he had fled the country, in a spectacular end to five decades of Baath party rule. Assad's whereabouts were not immediately clear, but his key backer Russia said he had resigned from the presidency and left Syria. Residents in the capital were seen cheering in the streets as the rebel factions heralded the departure of ‘tyrant’ Assad, saying: ‘We declare the city of Damascus free.’ AFPTV footage showed a column of smoke rising from central Damascus, and AFP correspondents in the city saw dozens of men, women and children wandering through Assad's luxurious home after it had been looted. The rooms of the residence had been left completely empty, save some furniture and a portrait of Assad discarded on the floor, while an entrance hall at the presidential palace not far away had been torched. ‘I can't believe I'm living this moment,’ tearful Damascus resident Amer Batha told AFP by phone. ‘We've been waiting a long time for this day,’ he said, adding: ‘We are starting a new history for Syria.’ Assad's reported departure comes less than two weeks after the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group challenged more than five decades of Assad family rule with a lightning offensive. ‘After 50 years of oppression under Baath rule, and 13 years of crimes and tyranny and (forced) displacement... we announce today the end of this dark period and the start of a new era for Syria,’ the rebel factions said on Telegram. While there has been no communication from Assad or his entourage on his whereabouts, Prime Minister Mohammed al-Jalali said he was ready to cooperate with ‘any leadership chosen by the Syrian people’. The head of war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Rami Abdel Rahman, told AFP: ‘Assad left Syria via Damascus international airport before the army security forces left’ the facility. AFP has been unable to independently verify some of the information provided by the different parties, including the reported departure. Prisoners set free Around the country, people toppled statues of Hafez al-Assad, Bashar al-Assad's father and the founder of the system of government that he inherited. For the past 50 years in Syria, even the slightest suspicion of dissent could land one in prison or get one killed. As rebels entered the capital, HTS said its fighters broke into a jail on the outskirts of Damascus, announcing an ‘end of the era of tyranny in the prison of Sednaya’, which has become a by-word for the darkest abuses of Assad's era. The rapid developments came just hours after HTS said it had captured the strategic city of Homs, where prisoners were also released. Homs was the third major city seized by the rebels, who began their advance on November 27, reigniting a years-long war that had become largely dormant. US President Joe Biden was keeping a close eye on the ‘extraordinary events’ unfolding in Syria, the White House said. US president-elect Donald Trump said that Assad had ‘fled his country’ after losing Russia's backing. Assad's rule had for years also been supported by Lebanese group Hezbollah, whose forces ‘vacated their positions around Damascus’, a source close to it said Sunday. Syria is ours Rebel factions aired a statement on Syrian state television, saying they had toppled the ‘tyrant’ Assad and urged fighters and citizens to safeguard the ‘property of the free Syrian state’. State TV later broadcast a message proclaiming the ‘victory of the great Syrian revolution’. According to the rebels, the Islamist leader of HTS, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, arrived in Damascus on Sunday. HTS is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda. Proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Western governments, it has sought to soften its image in recent years, and has told minority groups living in areas it now controls not to worry. Before Sunday's announcements, Damascus residents had described to AFP a state of panic as traffic jams clogged the city centre, with people seeking supplies and queueing to withdraw money. But morning saw chants and cheering, with celebratory gunfire and shouts of ‘Syria is ours and not the Assad family's’. Before Damascus, a string of towns and cities, including the northern city of Aleppo, had fallen from Assad's hands. The commander of Syria's US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which controls much of northeast Syria, hailed ‘historic’ moments with the fall of Assad's ‘authoritarian regime’. In a sign of the complexity of Syria's war, Israel struck Syrian army weapons depots Sunday on the outskirts of Damascus, according to the Observatory, which relies on a network of sources around the country. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the overthrow of Assad was a ‘historic day in the... Middle East’ and the fall of a ‘central link in Iran's axis of evil’. ‘This is a direct result of the blows we have inflicted on Iran and Hezbollah, Assad's main supporters,’ he added. The rebel offensive began the very day a ceasefire took effect in Lebanon after nearly a year of war between Israel and Hezbollah. The UN envoy for Syria said Syria was at ‘a watershed moment’, while Turkey, which has historically backed the opposition, called for a ‘smooth transition’. Iran, a key backer of Assad throughout the civil war years, said it expected ‘friendly’ ties with Syria to continue, even as its embassy in Damascus was vandalised. Jordan urged its citizens to leave neighbouring Syria ‘as soon as possible’, as have the United States and Russia, which both keep troops in Syria. Since the rebels' offensive began, at least 826 people, mostly combatants but also including 111 civilians, have been killed, the Observatory said. The United Nations said the violence has displaced 370,000 people.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252336/celebrations-across-syria-as-assad-flees

Somali pirates demand ransom for Chinese vessel,"Somali pirates who hijacked a Chinese fishing boat have demanded a ransom payment for the vessel and its 18 crew members, police and local officials said on Saturday. It was not immediately clear when the ship was taken hostage by gunmen wielding AK-47 assault rifles but the European Union’s anti-piracy force drew global attention to the incident on Thursday. ‘The pirates are moving the ship off the coast they are looking for a safe haven,’ Mohamed Dini, a police officer in Eyl, a traditional pirate stronghold on Puntland’s east coast, said. The boat was hijacked by men who had been contracted to provide ‘protection’ before later being reinforced by other pirates, Dini said, adding that they had demanded payment for its release. Ali Warsame, a local elder familiar with the case, said a Somali company acting on the boat’s behalf had offered to pay a $3,00,000 ransom. But the proposal was declined by the pirates. Local fishermen said the boat came close to Eyl on Friday, but the pirates pushed back into the sea out of fear of Puntland’s coast guards. But ‘they cannot move deeper towards the ocean because they are afraid of the foreign military ships,’ said fisherman Abdirahman Said. EU’s anti-piracy naval force Atalanta on Friday said it was closely monitoring the event ‘classified as armed robbery at sea’. ‘The crew remains safe, with no injuries,’ it added. The incident is the latest episode in a surge of Somali pirate activity after years of lull. In March, Somali pirates hijacked a Bangladeshi cargo ship transporting more than 55,000 tonnes of coal from Mozambique to the United Arab Emirates. The bulk carrier MV Abdullah was freed after its Bangladeshi owners, KSRM Group, paid a hefty ransom that was air-dropped over the vessel in sackloads of US dollars. The ransom amount was not disclosed by the company. A series of incidents since then has fuelled concerns about a resurgence of Indian Ocean raids by opportunistic pirates exploiting a security gap after the redeployment of international forces.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/252333/somali-pirates-demand-ransom-for-chinese-vessel
Notre Dame holds first mass after five-year restoration,"Newly restored Notre Dame cathedral held its first mass on Sunday, with Christians celebrating the return of the French capital’s most famous place of worship after a historic re-opening ceremony. The beloved Paris monument nearly burned down in 2019, but has been fully renovated inside and fitted with a new roof and spire during a frenzied five-year refit. The inaugural mass was led by Paris archbishop Laurent Ulrich with 150 bishops and more than 100 priests from the capital in attendance, as well as French president Emmanuel Macron. The archbishop led prayers and consecrated a new altar which replaced the old one that was destroyed five years ago. ‘Whether you are here in person in the cathedral or in front of a screen, including perhaps under the rain, I greet you with intense emotion,’ Ulrich told the congregation, referring to the small rain-drenched crowds outside watching events on public screens. In a nod to France’s ongoing political turmoil, he added that he ‘prayed also for our country that is looking to the future with worry.’ A second mass in the evening at 6:30pm (1730 GMT) will be open to the public, with roughly 2,500 people who secured free tickets this week expected to attend. The cathedral will open fully to visitors on December 16 via an online reservation system. During a re-opening service on Saturday attended by world leaders including US president-elect Donald Trump, Macron expressed the ‘gratitude of the French nation’ for the restoration work since 2019. ‘We have rediscovered what great nations can do — achieve the impossible,’ he said. Macron is under intense political pressure having called snap elections in June that led to a hung parliament, with the main parties now struggling to form a stable government. One of the most moving moments on Saturday came when firefighters in their protective gear walked through the congregation to thunderous applause as the word ‘Merci’ (‘Thank you’) was beamed on the intricate facade and famous belltowers of the Gothic masterpiece. The architectural wonder had been in danger of collapsing during the April 2019 blaze and was saved only by firefighters pumping vast quantities of water onto the flames from the nearby River Seine. Groups of worshippers huddled under umbrellas on Sunday beyond a strict security perimeter set up outside Notre Dame. ‘Beyond the reconstruction work, it’s beautiful because it shows that the church still has a role, discreet and small, but it still has a role to play in France,’ 21-year-old engineering student Jacques told AFP. Monique Kashale, a 75-year-old from the Democratic Republic of Congo, said she was ‘very cold but for Jesus Christ I can put up with it, for the Virgin Mary it is bearable.’ Saturday’s re-opening service began with the archbishop Ulrich, dressed in brightly coloured new vestments designed by fashion designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, knocking on the doors of the cathedral three times. Trump was placed on the front row as guest of honour next to Macron, with invitees marvelling at the freshly cleaned walls, new furniture and state-of-the-art lighting installed as part of the overhaul The reconstruction effort cost around 700 million euros ($750 million), financed from donations, with the five-year re-opening deadline met despite predictions it could take decades. Part of the cathedral’s lead roofing base still needs to be finished and the statues of the apostles and saints, removed before the fire to allow for their restoration, will only be reinstalled in the first half of 2025. The exact cause of the 2019 blaze has never been identified despite a forensic investigation by prosecutors, who believe an accident such as an electrical fault was the most likely reason. Notre Dame welcomed around 12 million visitors a year before the fire, but expects to receive an even higher figure of ‘14 to 15 million’ after the reopening, according to the church authorities.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252332/notre-dame-holds-first-mass-after-five-year-restoration
Ghana’s ex-president Mahama wins election,"Ghana’s former president John Dramani Mahama won a historic comeback election victory on Sunday after voters appeared to punish the ruling New Patriotic Party over its management of an economic crisis. NPP candidate vice president Mahamudu Bawumia on Sunday conceded defeat in the weekend presidential election after failing to shake off widespread frustration over high costs of living. Defeat in Saturday’s election ended eight years in power for the NPP under president Nana Akufo-Addo, marked by the west African state’s worst economic turmoil in years, high inflation and a debt default. For Mahama, president from 2012-2017, it was his third attempt to reclaim the nation’s top post after falling short in 2016 and 2020 elections. ‘The people of Ghana have spoken, the people have voted for change at this time and we respect it with all humility,’ Bawumia said in a press conference flanked by party officials. In what was a speedy concession with official vote tallies still coming in, Bawumia said he had called National Democratic Congress candidate Mahama to congratulate him. Blaring horns, waving flags and cheering, Mahama supporters were already celebrating outside the party campaign headquarters in the capital Accra. Mahama has yet to speak publicly since Bawumia’s concession. But on his X account, Mahama confirmed he received Bawumia’s congratulatory call over his ‘emphatic victory’. Ghana’s economic woes dominated the election, after the continent’s top gold producer and world’s No. 2 cacao exporter went through a crisis of default and currency devaluation, ending with a $3 billion IMF bailout. Earlier, NDC spokesman Sammy Gyamfi told reporters the party’s internal review of results showed Mahama won 56.3 per cent of the vote against 41.3 per cent for Bawumia. Political parties had agents at polling stations to observe and tally the initial vote counts before the ballots were sent for official collation by the election commission. Earlier, Commission Deputy Commissioner Bossman Asare told reporters regional results had yet to arrive at the national centre. The commission had said official results were likely due by Tuesday. With a history of democratic stability, Ghana’s two main parties, the NPP and NDC, have alternated in power equally since the return to multi-party politics in 1992. Under the slogan ‘Break the 8’ — a reference to two terms in power — Bawumia had sought to lead the NPP to an unprecedented third term. But he struggled to break away from criticism of Akufo-Addo’s economic record. Though inflation slowed from more than 50 per cent to around 23 per cent, and other macro-economic indicators are stabilising, economic struggles were still a clear election issue for many. That frustration opened the way for a comeback challenge from Mahama. But during campaigning, the former president also faced criticism from those who remember his government’s own financial problems especially the massive power cuts that marked his time in office.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/252331/ghanas-ex-president-mahama-wins-election
28 killed in shelling of Khartoum fuel station,"A Sudanese network of volunteer rescuers said that 28 civilians were killed Sunday when a fuel station in an area of Khartoum under paramilitary control came under shelling. The Sudanese army, which has been fighting the Rapid Support Forces since April 2023, has been advancing towards the capital in recent weeks, in a bid to regain control of Khartoum. On Sunday, a fuel station in RSF-held southern Khartoum was hit by shelling, said the South Belt Emergency Response Room. The youth-led volunteer group said ‘28 people were confirmed dead’ and ‘the number of injured reached 37, including 29 burns cases’ and some shrapnel injuries. Early in the war, which has pitted army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan against the forces of his former deputy, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, the paramilitaries had largely pushed the army out of Khartoum. The government, loyal to Burhan, is based in Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast, where the army has retained control. The war has killed tens of thousands of civilians and displaced over 11 million, creating what the United Nations has described as the world’s largest displacement crisis. In late November, the Sudanese army said it had retaken the Sennar state capital, Sinja, south of Khartoum, five months after paramilitaries had seized it. Sinja is a strategic area as it lies on a key road linking army-controlled areas of eastern and central Sudan. The RSF meanwhile has taken control of nearly all of the vast western region of Darfur, rampaged through the agricultural heartland of central Sudan and pushed into the army-controlled southeast.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252330/28-killed-in-shelling-of-khartoum-fuel-station
Lebanon boosting troops on Syria border,"The Lebanese army said on Sunday it was reinforcing its presence on the border with neighbouring Syria, after the government of president Bashar al-Assad fell and rebels took the capital Damascus. ‘In light of rapid developments and delicate circumstances that the region is going through units tasked with monitoring and controlling the northern and eastern borders have been reinforced, in conjunction with tightening surveillance measures,’ the army said in a statement. On Sunday, Syrian rebels swept into Damascus declaring they had toppled ‘tyrant’ Assad, whose current whereabouts are unknown after he reportedly fled the country. An AFP correspondent saw dozens of cars lining the main Masnaa crossing between the two countries as Syrian families returned home, with crowds cheering and chanting anti-Assad slogans. Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati said he discussed the situation at the Syrian border in a call with army commander Joseph Aoun and security forces chiefs. Mikati insisted ‘in these calls on the priority of tightening control over the border and distancing Lebanon from the repercussions of the developments in Syria’, his office said in a statement. Authorities say Lebanon currently hosts around two million Syrians, while more than 800,000 are registered with the United Nations — the highest number of refugees per capita in the world. Many fled Syria after its civil war began following the repression of anti-government protests in 2011.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252329/lebanon-boosting-troops-on-syria-border

Teknaf ex-OC Pradeep’s convicted wife granted bail,"The High Court on Sunday granted interim bail to Chumki Karan, wife of former Teknaf police station officer-in-charge Pradeep Kumar Das, in a corruption case where she was sentenced to a total of 21 years in prison for amassing illegal wealth. The bench of Justice AKM Asaduzzaman and Justice Syed Enayet Hossain issued the bail, considering her gender and the fact that she had already served two and a half years in prison, according to her lawyer Abdullah Al Mamun. Earlier the bail application was moved by lawyer Mahbub Shafique after being rejected multiple times by other High Court benches during the pendency of her appeal against the jail term. Abdullah Al Mamun moved Chumki’s fresh bail prayer after the Awami League government was toppled through a student-led mass uprising on August 5. Anti-Corruption Commission lawyer Asif Hassan vehemently opposed the bail stating that Chumki assisted Pradeep in amassing the wealth beyond the known sources. He told New Age that the ACC was not in a position to appeal the decision immediately, as it has yet to be reconstituted. Hassan said that he urged the office of Attorney General to challenge the bail order. According to her lawyer, there are no further legal barriers to Chumki’s release. Chumki was convicted on July 27, 2022, by a Chittagong court, which sentenced her to 21 years in prison and her husband, Pradeep Kumar Das, to 20 years. She would need to suffer in jail for 10 years as her 21 sentences were concurrent, lawyer said. The couple was found guilty of illegally amassing more than Tk 23.41 crore beyond their known sources of income, along with concealing assets worth Tk 4.21 crore. Chumki had surrendered to the court on May 23, 2022, in the graft case. Her husband, Pradeep, gained notoriety after being sentenced to death in January 2022 for the murder of retired army major Sinha Md Rashed Khan, who was fatally shot in July 2020. A Cox’s Bazar court handed death sentences to both Pradeep and his accomplice, Liakat Ali, in the high-profile murder case.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252326/teknaf-ex-oc-pradeeps-convicted-wife-granted-bail
"Tarique urges steps to recover stolen wealth, prosecute perpetrators","Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting chairman Tarique Rahman on Sunday urged the interim government to recover stolen wealth and take quick action against the ‘unprecedented scale of corruption’ under the Sheikh Hasina government. ‘The government must act immediately to recover the stolen wealth and prosecute those responsible for these crimes and justice must be swift and uncompromising to restore the people’s faith in governance and to ensure that such abuse of power will never recur,’ said Tarique in a Facebook post. Referring to the findings from a recent report by the White Paper preparation committee on the state of Bangladesh economy, he also said that the findings painted a grim picture, exposing then prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s administration as a kleptocracy defined by systematic looting of public resources. Tarique said that the White Paper revealed an unprecedented scale of corruption under Sheikh Hasina regime, underscoring the dire state of the nation’s financial health. The BNP leader further said that over the past 15 years, an estimated $240 billion was siphoned off from Bangladesh mentioning that among the most glaring examples of this plunder were 29 megaprojects from which $8 billion was misappropriated through inflated budgets. The so-called ‘quick rental’ energy projects promoted as solutions to infrastructure challenges, proved to be schemes for rapid profiteering at the expense of the public, he said. The BNP acting chairman also referred to a warning of the analysts that a deeper investigation into the banking sector would likely uncover an even darker reality. ‘These revelations reaffirm the urgent need for sweeping reforms to address corruption and rebuild the economy. Our party, the BNP, along with our allies, has proposed a 31-point reform agenda to tackle these systemic failures,’ he said. ‘Central to this agenda is the establishment of an effective Anti-Corruption Commission, as outlined in the 13th point. If this point is implemented this institution will play a critical role in ending the rampant misappropriation of public funds and ensure accountability across all sectors.’ ‘The 15th point of our proposal advocates for the creation of an Economic Reform Commission to bring transparency to the economic governance, strengthen public institutions, and foster a corruption-free administration led by competent and accountable leaders,’ he added. ‘The BNP remains committed to building a transparent, accountable, and equitable system for all Bangladeshis. The time for change is now—our nation cannot afford further mismanagement,’ Tarique Rahman said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/252321/tarique-urges-steps-to-recover-stolen-wealth-prosecute-perpetrators
Exhibition spreads message of peace,"A day-long art exhibition titled Artivism for Peace aimed at spreading message of peace was held at Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed Park in Gulshan in the capital on Sunday.

5 injured in BNP factional clash in Natore,"At least five individuals were injured in a clash between two factions of Bangladesh Nationalist Party leaders and activists over control of a canal at Bashila village in Naldanga upazila of Natore on Sunday. The injured are Entaz Ali, general secretary of Madnagar Union BNP’s ward no-8 unit, Abdur Razzak, organising secretary of ward no-9, and fishermen Habibur Rahman, Salim, and Ujjal. Witnesses and police reported that a longstanding dispute between the residents of Bashila and Halti villages over the Zia Canal, which flows through Halti Bil, escalated as water levels in the canal decreased. For the past two weeks, BNP leaders and activists from both villages have been vying for control of the canal for fishing purposes. On the day, a group from Halti village, led by BNP activist Md Folen, went to Bashila village armed with sticks to seize control of the canal. When Bashila villagers, including BNP members, resisted, a clash broke out, leaving five injured from both groups. Naldanga police station officer-in-charge Mostafizur Rahman stated that they intervened to bring the situation under control. However, no formal complaints had been lodged as of Sunday evening. Meanwhile, Naldanga upazila BNP general secretary Sakhawat Hossain denied the incident’s connection to the BNP, asserting it was a conflict between villagers rather than a political dispute.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252317/5-injured-in-bnp-factional-clash-in-natore
Dhaka-Delhi FS-level talks today,"Dhaka is likely to raise the issue of extradition of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina in the Bangladesh-India Foreign Office Consultation scheduled for today in the capital amid a tension between the two neighbours over the Hindu minority issues. Besides, the long-pending issues like water sharing treaty for Teesta and other common rivers, killing of Bangladeshi civilians by Indian Border Security Force, issuance of Indian visas and the connectivity would also be discussed during the meeting to be held at the Foreign Service Academy, said officials concerned. Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri is scheduled to arrive in Dhaka today to lead his side in the routine meeting with his Bangladeshi counterpart Md Jashim Uddin, according to the officials. ‘This kind of face-to-face meeting is crucial in overcoming any deadlock in communication although the foreign secretary-level meeting is a routine matter,’ said foreign adviser Md Touhid Hossain at a discussion in the city on Sunday. He hoped that the two foreign secretaries would have a fruitful discussion. The FOC is taking place days after Bangladesh shut its mission at Agartala in India on security ground on December 3 just a day after it came under attack by a group of Indian protesters during a violent demonstration. Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Verma was also summoned by the foreign ministry in Dhaka over the ‘heinous attack’ on its mission in Agartala, capital of Tripura state. India has been witnessing widespread protests over the arrest and detention of a Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das, a former leader of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, in Chattogram on November 25. ‘Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri is coming to Dhaka tomorrow. We hope that his visit would help resolve ongoing tension between the two countries,’ chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam told reporters at a press briefing at the Foreign Service Academy on Sunday. Describing Bangladesh’s relation with India as multifaceted, he said that it would be better in coming days. ‘We want that our relation with India would be based on fairness, equality and dignity,’ Shafiqul said, responding to a question. Officials said that Dhaka would raise the issue of extradition of Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India for shelter amid a student-led mass uprising on August 5. The last FOC was held in Delhi in November, 2023. After a diplomatic briefing at state guest house Padma earlier on December 2, foreign adviser Touhid Hossain said that the interim government wanted a ‘normal and good relation’ with New Delhi while maintaining mutual interests of both nations. He said that Dhaka’s relation with New Delhi before the August 5 situation was not the same since the fall of Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India bringing an end to her over 15-year autocratic rule.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/252316/dhaka-delhi-fs-level-talks-today

SC upholds HC judgment scrapping 5 cases against Yunus,"The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on Sunday upheld a High Court judgment that scrapped five labour law cases against Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, also the incumbent chief adviser of the interim government. A three-member apex court bench headed by Justice Md Ashfaqul Islam passed the order, dismissing a leave to appeal petition filed against the High Court judgment. Senior advocate Mustafizur Rahman Khan took part in the hearing for Muhammad Yunus, while additional attorney general Aneek Rushd Haque stood for the state. The High Court on October 24 scrapped the five cases against Yunus filled for allegedly violating labour law as the then chairman of Grameen Telecom. The state later filed the petition against the judgment. A few former employees of Grameen Telecom filed the cases with Dhaka 3rd Labour Court against three, including Muhammad Yunus on July 3, 2019. Yunus filed a petition with the High Court in 2020, pleading to quash the proceedings of the cases. The court after holding hearing on the plea, issued a rule in this regard. The High Court on October 24 ultimately scrapped all the five cases.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252314/sc-upholds-hc-judgment-scrapping-5-cases-against-yunus
Prof Yunus asks Meta to address disinformation campaign against Bangladesh,"Chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus on Sunday asked Meta, the parent company of Facebook, to address the disinformation campaign against Bangladesh run from certain countries to undermine the July-August mass uprising. ‘There’s a massive disinformation campaign, and we are the sufferers,’ the chief adviser told Meta’s director for human rights policy, Miranda Sissons, when she called on him at the state guest house Jamuna in Dhaka. At a press briefing by the chief adviser’s media wing on the day, meanwhile, press secretary Shafiqul Alam iterated the government’s commitment to bring back ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina from India to make her accountable for the genocide perpetrated during the July-August student-led mass uprising. At her meeting with the chief adviser, Miranda Sissons explained to Yunus the human rights policy of Meta saying that they remained alert to prevent anyone from using their platforms to spread disinformation. Yunus also asked Meta to make its technology more user-friendly for young entrepreneurs. ‘Technology is a tool to make things happen. But technology doesn’t decide what we want to do with things. So, we have to reengineer it to make it perfect,’ he said. ‘With Facebook you have a tremendous amount of possibility. Facebook could be used to turn young people entrepreneurs,’ he said. Yunus said that the Bangladesh government would remain engaged with Facebook for the benefit of the country’s young population. Besides, Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, an adviser of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank and a former head of the United Nations Development Programme, on Sunday called on the chief adviser at Jamuna. During the meeting, the chief adviser said that reform was the key word of the July-August student-led mass uprising, and his government was committed to carrying out major reforms before holding a free and fair election. The hour-long talks covered wide-ranging issues, including the mass uprising in July-August, development issues, interim government’s reform initiatives, disinformation campaign targeting the student-led movement, healthcare, social business and microcredit. Press secretary to the chief adviser Shafiqul Alam, meanwhile on the day, at a press conference at the Foreign Service Academy in Dhaka city invited the Indian media to come to Bangladesh instead of spreading false information. ‘We invite them for coming to Bangladesh and report from the ground because the accuracy of any report cannot be confirmed without going to the spot,’ he said. ‘We believe that if they come here, the misinformation being spread on the Indian TV and other media outlets will largely reduce,’ he added. In reply to a question, Shafiqul Alam also said that the government would bring Sheikh Hasina back and hand her over to the law. ‘Sheikh Hasina was the mastermind behind the genocide during the July mass uprising while enforced disappearances and public money laundering occurred during her tenure.’ ‘The government’s commitment is to bring her to justice and we must do it,’ he said. Referring to the prisoner exchange agreement with India, the press secretary also said that the government was currently working on the procedures. ‘The government is working to fulfil those procedures. After that, we will formally ask India to extradite her,’ he added.

"Principles of judgement, values of justice destroyed in past years: CJ","Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed on Sunday said that the people’s principles of judgement and values of justice were destroyed and distorted under the judicial process in the past years. ‘Right now we are standing on rubble,’ he said, adding, ‘dishonesty instead of integrity, deprivation instead of rights, oppression instead of justice, and torture instead of shelter were made normal.’ The remarks from the chief justice came while he was attending as the chief guest an event titled Citizen’s Conference 2024 at the Bangabandhu International Conference centre in the capital. He said that people had to start a new journey from this rubble and re-establish the values which had been destroyed, distorted and polluted. ‘This is a big challenge,’ he said and added that right from that day all would get a people-oriented and people-centric judicial system at their side in every good, pure and welfare-based work. He also said, ‘We are all aware that in this crisis situation the judicial system is not free from the damages.’ ‘But at this point I want to assure you by saying unambiguously that the judicial system has taken some bold steps for institutional reform and already started a new journey to overcome this situation,’ he continued. The chief justice also said that they had got a golden opportunity to help the oppressed at the moment of the historic victory of the students and people. ‘We have to be fully careful to make the full use of this opportunity,’ he added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252311/principles-of-judgement-values-of-justice-destroyed-in-past-years-cj
DUCSU elections likely early next year: DU proctor,"The long pending elections to Dhaka University Central Students’ Union and its hall unions are expected to take place by late January or early February next year, after a six-year gap since the last DUCSU polls in 2019. ‘There are a lot of things to do with DUCSU, including amending its constitutions and bringing reforms. However, we want to arrange the elections to DUCSU by the end of January and the beginning of February,’ Dhaka University proctor Saifuddin Ahmed said on Sunday while responding to a journalist’s query at a press conference at his office. ‘We use to face complexities in getting students’ opinions on different issues and know their problems and thus, conducting DUCSU polls is very crucial as it will simplify the process of understanding students’ opinions,’ he said. Proctor Saifuddin acknowledged several issues, including bringing reforms to the DUCSU constitution, as well as its charter as objections raised over the current structure. Debate also arose from the students about the vice-chancellor’s role whether the VC should serve as DUCSU’s president or not, he said, adding that students also complained over slogans, posters, and other traditional campaign activities. The proctor also informed that the Dhaka University Metro Rail Station would remain closed on December 16, 25, 31, and January 1 to maintain the law and order as a part of strict security arrangement across the country.

Bangladesh beat India to retain U-19 Asia Cup title,"Bangladesh Under-19 cricket team retained the ACC U-19 Asia Cup title with a crushing 59-run win over their Indian counterparts in the final at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday. Bangladesh won their maiden title of this tournament when they defeated hosts UAE by 195 runs in the final at the same venue in 2023. Junior Tigers posted 198 in 49.1 overs after being invited to bat first. In reply, India succumbed to 139 in 35.2 overs. The bowlers, especially pacer Iqbal Hasan Emon, were instrumental in taking three wickets for just 24 runs. Skipper Azizul Haque Tamim grabbed 3-8 while Al Fahad scalped two to secure their second title. Emon was adjudged the Player of the Match and the Player of the Tournament for taking 13 wickets. Pakistan’s Shahzaib Khan became the highest run-getter of the tournament with 336 runs. India never got going in the chase in the final, as they lost both of their openers within five overs. Bangladeshi bowlers continued to keep up the pressure, taking wickets at regular intervals. Emon took two consecutive wickets in the 20th over to reduce India to 73-5, and from there they could never recover. India captain Mohammad Aman showed a bit of resistance and top-scored with 26 runs before being dismissed by his Bangladeshi counterpart, who claimed a wicket maiden in his first over and swept the last two in his successive overs. Earlier, openers Zawad Abrar (20) and Kalam Siddiki (one) were dismissed cheaply to leave the side 41-2, but Bangladesh fell into deep trouble when the skipper Azizul fell for 16 runs. Rizan Hossan was the highest scorer with 47 runs off 65 deliveries, aided by three boundaries, and Shihab James contributed 40 off 67 with three fours and a six. Farid Hossain’s valuable 39 runs off 40 balls towards the end of the innings helped them set a moderate total. Yudhjit Guha, Hardik Raj, and Chetan Sharma grabbed two wickets apiece for India. Bangladesh had beaten Pakistan by seven wickets in the first semi-final in Dubai on December 6. ",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252309/bangladesh-beat-india-to-retain-u-19-asia-cup-title
Cummins warns India that Australia pumped up and back to their best,"Pat Cummins warned India that Australia are pumped up and back to their best as they look to carry the momentum from a commanding 10-wicket win on Sunday into the next Test in Brisbane. After being thumped by 295 runs in Perth, the hosts responded emphatically at Adelaide to wipe out Rohit Sharma's men inside three days and leave the five-match series evenly poised at 1-1. They did so without injured frontline bowler Josh Hazlewood, who appears on track to play the third Test at the Gabba starting on Saturday. ‘Great week, great to level the series. You know, I think we were back to our best,’ said skipper Cummins, who took 5-57 and seven wickets for the match. ‘That's the kind of team that I remember, and how we want to play our cricket. So really satisfying.’ The defeat in Perth and negative media coverage made their eighth consecutive pink-ball win in Adelaide taste even better, he added. ‘I think being one down, no doubt there's a little bit more on it, trying to level up the series,’ he said. ‘And, you know, you get a bit more pumped up for wickets. It's a big series, every Test match is big, every wicket is pretty big. So it's pretty pumped out there.’ After bowling out India for 180 in the first innings, Australia slammed 337 in reply to pile pressure on the visitors, with Travis Head's whirlwind 140 a game-changer. Cummins said it was a luxury having a weapon like him in the middle order. ‘It feels like every time he walks out the game's kind of in the balance, it can go one of two ways,’ he said. ‘And you know, within the space of a session or so, he really took the game out of their hands and just put the pressure right back onto the opposition. ‘If he feels like there's a small opportunity, he'll up the ante... so amazing and he's done it time and time again for us in many different formats. He's super-impressive.’ ",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252308/cummins-warns-india-that-australia-pumped-up-and-back-to-their-best
Stokes hails new generation after thumping NZ,"Captain Ben Stokes said Sunday that England's dominant displays in New Zealand shows they have quality in abundance coming through ahead of next year's Ashes. The visitors clinched the three-Test series with a game to spare, crushing the Black Caps in Wellington by 323 runs to follow their emphatic eight-wicket win in Christchurch. With bowling greats Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad retired, Stokes said he was excited about the strike weapons now at his disposal. Pace bowlers Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson, along with spinner Shoaib Bashir, have all been introduced to Test cricket this year. Along with veteran seamer Chris Woakes, they outplayed their counterparts in New Zealand conditions. ‘When you have a bowling attack like we've been able to field in these first two games, with the point of difference when it's required, is massive for us,’ Stokes said. The lively Carse impressed on debut in Pakistan in October and has taken 25 wickets in his first four Tests at an average below 17. Atkinson, who bagged a hat-trick in Wellington, has been consistently impressive since taking 12 wickets on debut against the West Indies at Lord's in July. ‘It's great to see the guys who we see having a very long future and being the main crop of bowlers for us going forward doing really well and being exposed to different conditions,’ said Stokes. ‘Brydon Carse, Gus Atkinson have been so good for us in the time that they've been out there playing for England. ‘And now they have some unbelievable experience under their belts.’ Meanwhile, Stokes said the decision to bat 21-year-old Jacob Bethell at number three in his maiden Test series had been justified by his performances. Bethell answered critics of his rapid promotion -- without a first-class century to his name -- with a sparkling 96 in his second innings at the Basin Reserve. ‘As a young lad with so much potential and so much talent, why not let him go out there and expose himself to Test cricket at its toughest?’ Stokes said. ‘He's proved a lot to a lot of people and proved why we rate him so highly.’ ",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252307/stokes-hails-new-generation-after-thumping-nz

Bayern compare Musiala to Messi and Ronaldo,"Bayern Munich sporting director Max Eberl said Jamal Musiala was a game-changer like Ballon d'Or winners Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo after yet another star showing for the German giants. Musiala was the difference in Saturday's 4-2 win over lowly Heidenheim, which lifted Bayern six points clear atop the table. Musiala came off the bench with Bayern level 1-1 and had the hosts in front just five minutes later. With the score 3-2 to Bayern and Heidenheim, who are in the relegation playoff spot, pushing for an equaliser, Musiala collected the ball near the half-way line and sprinted all the way to score Bayern's fourth. Eberl said ‘Messi in Barcelona or Ronaldo in Real Madrid, they are simply great players who can decide games. ‘Jamal can do that, we know that.’ Speaking before the game on Friday, Bayern manager Vincent Kompany echoed Eberl's statements when asked if the league leaders were too reliant on Musiala. ‘Weren't Real Madrid dependent on Ronaldo? Weren't Barcelona dependent on Messi? ‘Jamal has so much quality, so it's normal that a lot of things are being said about him. He's definitely a special player and of course he's important for us.’ Musiala was born in Germany but raised in England and came through the Chelsea academy. Despite representing the Three Lions as a teenager alongside friend Jude Bellingham, Musiala elected to switch his allegiance to Germany as a senior player. Eberl lauded Musiala for stepping in for the injured Bayern striker Harry Kane, who has missed the last two games with a hamstring tear. ‘Thank God we have someone else in Harry who can decide games too, but he's injured at the moment, so Jamal steps in for him. ‘It's simply an outstanding quality. ‘We all know what a great footballer he is. There's a reason we are talking about him every weekend and after every game.’ Bayern veteran Thomas Mueller -- who Musiala replaced in the second half -- praised the 21-year-old, telling Sky Germany ‘what he's doing, we expect that from him now. ‘We're happy we've got him.’ The goals were Musiala's seventh and eighth of the league season but remarkably the first he had scored in Munich. ‘I've finally scored again here in the arena - it feels good to celebrate with the fans,’ Musiala said. ‘I think I've played a lot of games back to back’, Musiala said of his benching, adding ‘it was good that I got a break and came back with new energy.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/252305/bayern-compare-musiala-to-messi-and-ronaldo-

Govt to take action aganist foreigners staying illegally in Bangladesh,"The home ministry on Sunday requested the foreign nationals, living and working at different organisations in Bangladesh illegally, to obtain legal residency and work permit documents. Legal actions will be taken against those who would be found working or residing illegally, said a said a warning notice of the ministry’s Security Services Division issued on Sunday. The notice also said that the ministry came to know from different sources that many foreign nationals were staying Bangladesh illegally. The home adviser, retired lieutenant general Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, on the day said, ‘No foreigners will be allowed to stay in Bangladesh illegally….

He said that, after receiving total statistics, they would impose timeframe for foreign nationals to be regular. ‘Border is on alert at all places. Sylhet and Benapole borders are no longer on alert alone,’ said Jahangir when he was asked about the tension between India and Bangladesh along border.

England thrash New Zealand in 2nd Test to win series,"An aggressive England dominated almost from start to finish to thrash New Zealand by 323 runs on Sunday in the second Test and emphatically win the series with a match to go. Joe Root scored a century before England's bowlers knocked over New Zealand for 259 in the final session of day three in Wellington, clinching a series on New Zealand soil for the first time since 2008. As with their eight-wicket loss in Christchurch, New Zealand were outplayed for long periods, although Tom Blundell showed some late resistance with a century as he fought bravely in the unlikely pursuit of a winning target of 583. The wicketkeeper was dismissed for 115 soon after tea, caught brilliantly by slip Ben Duckett off spinner Shoaib Bashir to spark a tail-order collapse. Nathan Smith (42) and Matt Henry (4) both fell to Ben Stokes (3-5) before the England skipper removed Tim Southee (8), caught in the deep in the game's final act. Stokes said it was ‘amazing’ to win the series playing the sort of front-foot style they have made a trademark under his leadership. He praised Harry Brook's ‘bravery’ in his thrilling first-day knock of 123 which swung the momentum after New Zealand's seamers claimed four early scalps. ‘That wicket is what we call a snakepit, especially on day one, it was doing plenty,’ Stokes said at the Basin Reserve. ‘For Brooky to have the bravery and the backing of his own ability -- but to also have the skill to go out and play like that -- was just absolutely phenomenal. ‘Brooky thought that putting the pressure back on the New Zealand bowlers was exactly what was needed, knocking them off their length.’ With England sensing a quick victory, Root set the tone on day three by posting his 36th century before being dismissed for 106, prompting a declaration half an hour after the resumption with England 427-6. New Zealand, who have looked nothing like the side that recently stunned India 3-0 away, limped to 59-4 at lunch in response. Their innings gained some respectability in the middle session through the efforts of Blundell, Smith and Daryl Mitchell (32). Despite his team's plight Blundell was prepared to play shots, compiling 13 fours and five sixes as he achieved a fifth century to end a lean run of form. Stokes, whose side was beaten in Pakistan last time out, said he was always confident they wouldn't need a fourth day to complete a rampant victory. ‘Look, 580 is a lot of runs wherever you are, there's always going to be pressure on New Zealand to chase that down, particularly on that wicket,’ he said. Stokes, who saw seamer Gus Atkinson take a hat-trick on Saturday, added: ‘The bowling performances throughout the first two games have just been exceptional.’ The blustery conditions on Sunday didn't bother England's new-ball attack, with veteran Chris Woakes (2-20) thriving into a strong wind. He clean-bowled out-of-form opener Devon Conway without scoring before claiming the prized scalp of Kane Williamson for four, caught behind. Brydon Carse (2-53) dismissed Tom Latham for 24 with a sharp, one-handed caught and bowled, before enticing Rachin Ravindra (6) into a loose shot which was snicked. Before that, Stokes was 49 not out when he made his declaration, having put on 100 for the sixth wicket with Root off just 13.2 overs. They added 49 to their overnight score, allowing time for Root to complete a classy ton. Root, who resumed on 73, reached three figures with a spectacular reverse lap shot which flew over Blundell's head off paceman Will O'Rourke.New Zealand captain Latham said two heavy losses left his team ‘obviously hurting’ but they would aim to salvage some pride in the third and final Test starting in Hamilton on Saturday. ‘We came here with hopes today of putting up some good partnerships but losing three or four (wickets) early on put us on the back foot,’ he said. ‘England put us under pressure and when they've done that, they've managed to put the foot on the throat. ‘They're playing some great cricket at the moment.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252302/england-thrash-new-zealand-in-2nd-test-to-win-series
Australia thump India at fortress Adelaide to level series,"A resurgent Australia thumped India by 10 wickets to win the second Test on Sunday and level their blockbuster five-match series 1-1 after a batting and bowling masterclass at fortress Adelaide Oval. Chasing just 19 for victory, openers Usman Khawaja and Nathan McSweeney steered the hosts to the meagre target without loss on day three of the pink-ball clash. The visitors resumed at 128-5 after their hopes were left in tatters during a final fiery session on Saturday at the hands of an Australian pace onslaught. They only boosted the total to 175 before meekly surrendering. Danger man Rishabh Pant failed to negotiate the opening over from Mitchell Starc and was out without adding to his overnight 28 while Pat Cummins accounted for Ravichandran Ashwin (7) then Harshit Rana (0). Allrounder Nitish Kumar Reddy made a plucky 42 before he fell to Scott Boland, who then removed Mohammed Siraj (7) to end the innings. Skipper Cummins ended with 5-57 while Boland grabbed 3-51. Starc took eight wickets for the match. ‘That's a great week. We were far from the team we want to be in Perth but this was good,’ said Cummins, whose side was well beaten in the series opener. The captain reserved special praise for Travis Head after his match-winning century. ‘He loves batting here, again one of those momentum-shifts, it could have gone either way when he walked out to bat,’ Cummins said. ‘The ball does a bit more under lights, but the big thing was getting a big lead.’ Defeat was another painful memory of Adelaide for India, who also crashed within three days in 2020 when they were bundled out for 36 -- their lowest-ever Test score. Victory capped a fighting turnaround for Australia after being crushed by 295 runs in the first Test, which sparked fierce criticism over whether the top-ranked but ageing team could still produce the goods. While Khawaja and Steve Smith were again notable flops with the bat, the hosts largely silenced the critics -- at least until the next Test at the Gabba in Brisbane from Saturday. Australia were always odds-on favourites in Adelaide despite the Perth calamity, boasting far more experience of day-night Test cricket. They have now won 12 of their 13 games played under lights, including a perfect 8-0 record in Adelaide. In contrast, India have a 3-2 win-loss record in the format, with both defeats to Australia in the South Australian capital. ‘Disappointing week for us. We didn't play well enough to win the game,’ said India skipper Rohit Sharma. ‘There were times when we could have grabbed the opportunity but failed, which cost us the game. ‘What we did in Perth was great but every game throws a new challenge. Looking forward to the next Test and we will see what we did well in Perth.’ India's problems began on the first ball of the match, when a menacing Starc trapped hot-shot young opener Yashasvi Jaiswal -- a century-maker in Perth -- lbw. They never recovered, all out for 180, with Reddy top-scoring on 42 and Starc ending with a career-best 6-48. India's pace attack were then unable to make the best use of the new pink ball when Australia battled through a difficult phase till stumps for the loss of just Khawaja on day one. The visitors' bowling coach Morne Morkel pinpointed a failure by their young attack to find the right lines and lengths. The next day Head made them pay with a rollicking game-changing 140 while Marnus Labuschagne hit 64 to propel Australia to 337 and an ominous 157-run lead. In contrast to India, Australia then drew on their experience to decimate India's top order when they took the new ball at dusk on Saturday. It left them with just five wickets to mop up Sunday, which they did with minimum fuss. ",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252301/australia-thump-india-at-fortress-adelaide-to-level-series
"One more case filed against Chinmoy, followers","One more case was filed against Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, a leader of Sammilita Sanatani Jagaran Jote, and his followers on Sunday. The case was filed with the Chattogram Metropolitan Magistrate court 1 over the clash involving police and followers of Chinmoy, also a former leader of International Society for Krishna Consciousness, better known as ISKCON, on the court premises. Chinmoy Krishna has been made the prime accused in the case, alongside 164 named individuals and an estimated 400 to 500 unnamed persons. The case was filed in the morning by Enamul Haque, a businessman and an activist of the Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh, with the court of Chattogram metropolitan magistrate Md Abu Bakar Siddique. The court ordered Kotwali police station inspector for investigation to investigate the allegation. According to the case statement, on November 26, while returning home after completing land registry work, Enamul was allegedly attacked by followers of Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari. Enamul claimed that he was attacked for wearing punjabis and a prayer cap, resulting in injuries to his right hand and head. He was rescued by pedestrians and admitted to Chattogram Medical College Hospital. His delay in filing the case was due to his prolonged illness, Enamul said in his case statement. A total of six cases were filed so far over incidents centring the murder of lawyer Saiful Islam Alif in the court building area in Chattogram city. Charges in these cases include, among others, obstructing government officers from performing their duty and vandalism. Of the six cases, three have been filed by the police, while victim families filed two cases, and a businessman filed the rest one. A total of 38 people have been arrested in connection with the killing of Saiful. On Tuesday, the court of Chattogram Metropolitan Sessions Judge Saiful Islam, meanwhile, rescheduled the bail hearing for Chinmoy Krishna Das for January 2 as no defence lawyer appeared on his behalf. Chinmoy was sent to jail after his bail petition was rejected on November 26. He was arrested on sedition charges on November 25 in the Dhaka city.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252300/one-more-case-filed-against-chinmoy-followers

"BNP front wings march towards Indian mission, urge action","Police stopped the joint procession of the affiliated organisations of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party near Rampura Bridge on Sunday as it was marching towards the Indian high commission in Dhaka from the party’s central office at Naya Paltan. Several thousand leaders and activists of Bangladesh Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, Bangladesh Jatiyatabadi Juba Dal, and Swechchhasebak Dal started the march at about 11:30am in front of the party’s central office at Naya Paltan. With this large procession, the countrywide protests against the attack on Bangladesh assistant high commission in India’s Agartala rolled into the seventh consecutive day on Sunday. Huge traffic congestions were created due to the march and people suffered immensely as the blockade near Rampura Bridge created backlog till Malibagh in the south and Natun Bazar in the north. Later, a six-member delegation from the three BNP associate bodies submitted a memorandum to the Indian high commission at about 1:05pm to register their protests against the recent anti-Bangladesh incidents in the neighbouring country. The delegation consisted of Chhatra Dal president Rakibul Islam Rakib and general secretary Nasir Uddin Nasir, Juba Dal central president Monayem Munna, its general secretary Nurul Islam Nayan, Swechchhasebak Dal president SM Jilani and general secretary Rajib Ahsan. The demands in the memorandum include a thorough investigation into the attack on the Bangladesh mission in Agartala and appropriate punitive measures against the perpetrators, to ensure safety and security of all Bangladesh diplomatic missions and personnel in India and stopping misinformation on Bangladesh by leveraging their media. Members of Bangladesh Army, Bangladesh Navy, police and Coast Guard members were seen deployed in and around Indian high commission in Dhaka. Law enforcers and security agency members block road at Bashtola area near Indian high commission and neither vehicle nor people were allowed on the road. Dhaka Metropolitan Police Gulshan Division deputy commissioner Mohammad Tareq Mahmud told New Age that they had increased the security in and around Indian high commission considering the BNP’s march. ‘We have been taking special security measures centering Indian high commission since Tuesday and it will be continued until further notice,’ he said. Earlier, addressing a short rally in front of the BNP’s central office before the march, BNP senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi alleged that the Indian ruling party’s ploy to bring Sheikh Hasina back to Bangladesh was nothing but direct aggression. ‘You [Indian government] do not like the people of Bangladesh. You do not respect the sovereignty and independence of Bangladesh,’ he said. Rizvi unequivocally said that 180 million people of Bangladesh were prepared to resist Delhi’s hegemony. The Bangladesh mission in Agartala came under attack in the afternoon of December 2 by a group of Indians during their protests demanding the release of Hindu community leader in Bangladesh Chinmoy Krishna Das, now in jail in a sedition case.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/252295/bnp-front-wings-march-towards-indian-mission-urge-action
Dhaka becomes 2nd most polluted city on Sunday morning,"Dhaka, the overcrowded capital city of Bangladesh, has ranked the second on the list of cities with the worst air quality with an AQI score of 240 at 9:00am on Sunday morning. Sunday’s air was classified as ‘very unhealthy’ and such air quality continued for the past few days, posing a grave health threat, according to the AQI index. When the AQI value for particle pollution is between 50 and 100, air quality is considered ‘moderate’, usually sensitive individuals should consider limiting prolonged outdoor exertion, between 101 and 150, air quality is considered ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’, between 150 and 200 is ‘unhealthy’, between 201 and 300 is said to be ‘very unhealthy’, while a reading of 301 and above is considered ‘hazardous’, posing serious health risks to residents. India’s Delhi, Egypt’s Cairo and Pakistan’s Karachi and Lahore respectively occupied the first, third and fourth spots on the list, with AQI scores of 369, 213 and 190 respectively. The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. The AQI in Bangladesh is based on five pollutants — particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon. As per World Health Organisation, air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, mainly due to increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/environment-climate-change/252294/dhaka-becomes-2nd-most-polluted-city-on-sunday-morning
Bashar al-Asad leaves Syria as rebels announce entering Damascus,"The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said on Sunday that president Bashar al-Assad had left the country, after losing swathes of territory to a lightning rebel offensive while Islamist-led rebels said that they were ‘entering Damascus’. Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said that ‘Assad left Syria via Damascus international airport before the army security forces left’ the facility. AFP was unable to immediately confirm the report. Gunfire rang out in the Syrian capital Sunday, residents told AFP, as Islamist-led rebels said they were ‘entering Damascus’ in a lightning offensive against government forces. As a war monitor reported the army and security forces abandoned the capital’s international airport, a source close to Hezbollah told AFP fighters from the key Assad ally had left their positions around Damascus. The Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group said its forces were moving into the capital, shortly before they announced an ‘end of the era of tyranny in the prison of Sednaya’ as they broke into the jail which has become a by-word for darkest abuses of the Syrian regime. The major developments in Damascus come only hours after HTS said they had captured the strategic city of Homs, on the way to the capital. The defence ministry earlier denied that rebels had entered Homs, describing the situation there as ‘safe and stable’. Homs lies about 140 kilometres north of the capital and was the third major city seized by the rebels who began their advance on November 27, reigniting a years-long war that had become largely dormant. Sources from the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported Sunday officers and soldiers of government forces withdrew from Damascus International Airport. The monitor also confirmed ‘the doors of the infamous “Sednaya” prison... have been opened for thousands of detainees who were imprisoned by the security apparatus throughout the regime’s rule’. Earlier, Assad’s government denied the army had withdrawn from areas around Damascus. ‘A very strong security and military cordon’ was being established by the armed forces around the capital ‘and no one... can penetrate this defensive line’, interior minister Mohammed al-Rahmoun told state television. Assad has for years been backed by Lebanese Hezbollah, whose forces ‘vacated their positions around Damascus’ according to a source close to the group. Hezbollah ‘has instructed its fighters in recent hours to withdraw from the Homs area, with some heading to Latakia in Syria and others to the Hermel area in Lebanon’, the source also told AFP. A source close to Hezbollah earlier said it had sent 2,000 fighters into Syria, to an area near the Lebanese border, ‘to defend its positions’. The defence ministry earlier insisted, ‘There is no truth to news claiming our armed forces... have withdrawn’ from positions near Damascus. The Syrian army said that, in addition to the area around Damascus, it was reinforcing positions in the south, and operations against the rebels were beginning in the Hama, Homs and Daraa areas. AFP has been unable to independently verify some of the information provided by the government and the rebels, as its journalists cannot reach the areas around Damascus where the rebels say they are present. Residents of the capital described to AFP a state of panic as traffic jams clogged the city centre, people sought supplies and queued to withdraw money from ATMs. ‘The situation was not like this when I left my house this morning... suddenly everyone was scared,’ said one woman, Rania. A few kilometres away, the mood was starkly different. In a Damascus suburb, witnesses said protesters toppled a statue of Assad's father, the late leader Hafez al-Assad. AFPTV images from Hama, Syria's fourth-largest city, showed abandoned tanks and other armoured vehicles, one of them on fire. Hama resident Kharfan Mansour said he was ‘happy with the liberation of Hama and the liberation of Syria from the Assad regime’. The president’s office denied reports Assad had left Damascus, saying he was working ‘from the capital’. The Observatory said government forces had ceded more key ground, losing control of all southern Daraa province, the cradle of the 2011 uprising. The army said it was ‘redeploying and repositioning’ in Daraa and another southern province, Sweida. The Observatory also said troops were also evacuating posts in Quneitra, near the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. Jordan has urged its citizens to leave neighbouring Syria ‘as soon as possible’, as have the United States and Assad ally Russia, which both keep troops in Syria. An AFP correspondent in Daraa saw local fighters guarding public property and civil institutions. In Sweida, a local fighter told AFP that after government forces withdrew ‘from their positions and headquarters, we are now securing and protecting vital facilities.’ An Iraqi security source told AFP that Baghdad has allowed in hundreds of Syrian soldiers, who ‘fled the front lines’, through the Al-Qaim border crossing. A second source put the figure at 2,000 troops, including officers. HTS is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda. Proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Western governments, it has sought to soften its image in recent years, and told minority groups living in areas they now control not to worry. Since the offensive began, at least 826 people, mostly combatants but also including 111 civilians, have been killed, the Observatory said. The United Nations said the violence has displaced 370,000 people. UN special envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, called for ‘urgent political talks’ to implement a 2015 Security Council resolution, which set out a roadmap for a negotiated settlement. US president-elect Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that the United States should ‘not get involved’, after outgoing US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Friday for a ‘political solution to the conflict’, in a call with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. After Fidan and his Iranian and Russian counterparts discussed Syria in Qatar on Saturday, Iran’s top diplomat Abbas Araghchi said they agreed on the initiation of ‘political dialogue between the Syrian government and legitimate opposition groups’. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said it was ‘inadmissible’ to allow a ‘terrorist group to take control’ of Syrian territory. Moscow and Tehran have supported Assad's government and army during the war. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government backs some armed groups in northern Syria, said Saturday that Syria ‘is tired of war, blood and tears’.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/world/252293/bashar-al-asad-leaves-syria-as-rebels-announce-entering-damascus
Pro-EU protesters march on Georgia parliament,"Thousands of protesters marched in the Georgian capital Tbilisi on Saturday for the 10th day of rallies sparked by a disputed election and the government decision to shelve EU accession talks. Demanding fresh elections and a return to European integration, the demonstrators headed towards parliament, undeterred by a police crackdown on pro-EU protesters and attacks on the opposition. The Caucasus nation has been engulfed in turmoil since the governing Georgian Dream party declared victory in a disputed October 26 election. The government past week said it would suspend talks to join the European Union, sparking a fresh wave of demonstrations. Its critics accuse it of creeping authoritarianism and of steering the country back towards Russia. Georgia’s pro-Western president Salome Zurabishvili — at loggerheads with the ruling party — said on social media she had had ‘in-depth discussion’ with the US president-elect Donald Trump and French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in Paris. She said they had discussed the ‘stolen election and extremely alarming repression against the people of Georgia. ‘Underscored the need for a strong US,’ she added. ‘The Georgian people have a friend in Donald Trump.’ Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky — whose country has been at war with Russia for almost three years — said on Saturday he fully backed Georgia's anti-government protesters. Zelensky urged Tbilisi to stop ‘surrendering’ to Moscow in a meeting with Zurabishvili in Paris. He has warned of Russian influence in Georgia for months. Zurabishvili has denounced widespread fraud in October’s parliamentary polls, branding the freshly elected legislature and government ‘illegitimate’. Blowing horns and whistles, pro-European protesters marched Saturday from Tbilisi State University towards parliament, blocking one of the city’s main traffic arteries, an AFP reporter saw. As on previous nights, some demonstrators banged on the metal barriers blocking the parliament entrance. Others pointed laser beams at the building and the police blocking the adjacent streets. ‘They are trying to arrest us, punish us, but we won’t back down, we are not afraid,’ said 19-year-old protester Giorgi Romanadze. ‘This is our last chance to be free, to be happy. We want Europe, and Europe only.’ Some demonstrators held signs reading ‘We demand free and fair elections’ and ‘Free all unjustly arrested,’ as calls for stronger international backing grew louder among the protesters. ‘We are fighting for our freedom... and we want the international community to help us,’ said 32-year-old Teona Chakvetadze. ‘We need the international community to sanction our oligarchs and this illegitimate government.... We can’t win this fight on our own.’ Independent television station Pirveli reported that dozens of masked men had severely beaten its journalists. Police officers stood by without intervening during the incident near the protest venue. The opposition alliance, For Change, released CCTV footage showing the masked men raiding its office and badly beating opposition figure Koba Khabazi. The Georgian Dream government security forces had faced persistent accusations of deploying plainclothes security agents to target and attack political opponents. The crackdown has triggered outrage at home and mounting international condemnation. Officers have made hundreds of arrests, including 48 at a protest on Friday. The country’s rights ombudsman has accused the police of ‘torture’ against those detained, with scores reporting mistreatment or showing visible injuries. With both sides ruling out a compromise, there appeared to be no clear route out of the crisis. The United States, France and Germany are among the Western countries to have denounced the crackdown on protests, but the government has refused to back down. Georgian prime minister Irakli Kobakhidze has praised his security forces after several opposition party offices were raided and their leaders arrested. ‘We have won an important battle against liberal fascism in our country,’ he told journalists, using language reminiscent of Kremlin rhetoric against its political opponents. Demonstrators have rejected Kobakhidze’s characterisation of the protest movement. Thousands have also staged daily protests in other parts of Georgia, including the cities of Batumi, Kutaisi, Rustavi, Zugdidi, and Telavi, local media reported. Critics of Georgian Dream are enraged by what they call its betrayal of the country's bid for EU membership, enshrined in the constitution and supported by around 80 per cent of the population. Georgian Dream, in power for more than a decade, has advanced controversial legislation in recent years, targeting civil society and independent media and curbing LGBTQ rights. Brussels has warned that such policies are incompatible with EU membership, while domestic detractors accuse the government of copying Russia’s playbook.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252292/pro-eu-protesters-march-on-georgia-parliament
Musiala to the rescue as Bayern go six clear,"Jamal Musiala came off the bench to rescue an injury-hit Bayern Munich, scoring twice in a 4-2 win over lowly Heidenheim, sending his side six points clear in the Bundesliga on Saturday. With the top four sides all playing teams in the bottom half in this round, second-placed Frankfurt let a one-goal lead slip to draw 2-2 at home with Augsburg. Bayern dominated proceedings but were unable to turn pressure into points, with Harry Kane's absence telling. The German giants were one goal up at half-time after Dayot Upamecano headed from a corner 18 minutes in. The France defender turned villain early into the second period when he passed directly to Mathias Honsak, who gleefully accepted the invitation to equalise. Bayern manager Vincent Kompany, whose side were eliminated in the German Cup by Bayer Leverkusen midweek, brought Musiala off the bench and the 21-year-old blasted in five minutes later. Leon Goretzka's late goal put Bayern on course but Heidenheim scored again, this time through Niklas Dorsch, to keep the heat on the home side, Musiala would have the final say, dribbling on the counter from the half-way line and scoring his second. Bayern veteran Thomas Mueller praised Musiala, telling Sky ‘what he's doing, we expect that from him now. ‘We're happy we've got him.’ Borussia Dortmund's away woes continued ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash with Barcelona when they were held to a 1-1 draw with Borussia Moenchengladbach despite another stunning Jamie Gittens goal. Gittens, who scored an excellent solo goal in last week's 1-1 draw against Bayern, dribbled past three Gladbach defenders and blasted a shot in off the crossbar after 64 minutes to put Dortmund ahead. Six minutes later, Pascal Gross held Tim Kleindienst away from a looping cross just inches from goal. The hold was unnecessary as Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel got his fingers to the ball but a penalty was given on VAR review, with Kevin Stoeger converting. Subbed on in the 89th minute, Gladbach's Tomas Cvancara was sent off after picking up two yellows inside one stoppage-time minute, but the hosts held on to grab a point. Dortmund have now drawn two and lost four of six away games this season. ‘It's frustrating to go home with just a point,’ visiting captain Nico Schlotterbeck told Sky. ‘As Dortmund you expect to win here’ he added. In Frankfurt, a goalless first half gave way to four goals in 19 second-half minutes. Hugo Ekitike's 55th-minute goal was cancelled out by a Phillip Tietz strike five minutes later. Augsburg then took the lead through Samuel Essende, before Turkish teenager Can Uzun levelled things up three minutes later. Frankfurt's late efforts to find a winner were to no avail as the hosts dropped points in the league for the first time since late October. Defending champions Leverkusen continued their recent resurgence, beating promoted St Pauli 2-1 thanks to first-half goals from Florian Wirtz and Jonathan Tah. Injuries to Victor Boniface, Patrik Schick and Amine Adli deprived Leverkusen coach Xabi Alonso of a centre-forward. Wirtz however filled in nicely, finishing calmly in front of goal after eight minutes before Tah headed in from a cross midway through the second half. Pauli's Morgan Guilavogui scored late but it was not enough as Leverkusen held on to win their fifth straight game. RB Leipzig got back to winning ways, defeating promoted Holstein Kiel 2-0 away, their first victory in the league since October. Benjamin Sesko put the visitors in front 27 minutes in and Andre Silva converted a penalty to seal the game, his first Leipzig goal since January 2023. Kiel fans unfurled a banner before the match depicting incoming Red Bull head of football Jurgen Klopp in crosshairs and saying the energy drinks company was ‘digging the grave of German football’. Fans in Germany have been critical of Red Bulls' involvement in the game, particularly their ownership of RB Leipzig. Jens Stage scored the only goal as Werder Bremen won 1-0 at struggling Bochum, who have only two points in 13 games this season.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/252291/musiala-to-the-rescue-as-bayern-go-six-clear
Bellingham and Mbappe strike as Madrid beat Girona,"Jude Bellingham guided champions Real Madrid to a comfortable 3-0 victory at Girona on Saturday in La Liga, with Kylian Mbappe also on the scoresheet after two high-profile penalty misses in recent games. Los Blancos cut the gap on league leaders Barcelona to two points after the Catalans drew 2-2 at Real Betis, with Madrid having played one fewer match. Bellingham opened the scoring before half-time and set up Turkish playmaker Arda Guler for Madrid’s second, before Mbappe produced a clinical finish for their third. Both Bellingham and defender Ferland Mendy were replaced with apparent knocks in the second half ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League clash at Atalanta. Coach Carlo Ancelotti confirmed Bellingham was ‘available’ for the game but said Mendy had suffered a muscular injury. After Madrid’s fifth defeat across all competitions in midweek against Athletic Bilbao, having lost just twice last season, Ancelotti pledged his team would improve and they were significantly better against Girona. ‘Bellingham scored his fifth goal running (in La Liga), Mbappe scored, Brahim (Diaz) did good work, Arda scored a great goal,’ Ancelotti said. ‘We have to bear the moment out and as I said, bit by bit we will come back (to form).’ With Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo sidelined, Ancelotti selected Bellingham and Diaz in support of Mbappe. The French forward has been the focus of criticism in recent weeks after blowing penalties against Liverpool and Athletic Bilbao, and struggling to find the form which made him a star with Paris Saint-Germain and his country. Girona, who ran Madrid close for the Spanish title for much of last season before eventually finishing third, started the stronger but Madrid soon clicked into gear. Bellingham pounced after 36 minutes when Diaz’s cross was blocked and the ball fell kindly to the England international to drill home. It was Bellingham’s fifth goal in his last five La Liga games, finding the form which powered Madrid to a Champions League and La Liga double last season. Los Blancos got their second in the 55th minute when Bellingham threaded through a fine pass for Guler to finish. Mbappe rattled in Madrid’s third from a tight angle after Bellingham hobbled off with a knock after Luka Modric played him in down the right. Ancelotti will hope Madrid can carry some momentum into the vital Champions League visit to Atalanta, for which Vinicius is expected to return from a hamstring problem. Girona, eighth in La Liga, welcome Liverpool in the Champions League on Tuesday. Earlier Real Betis twice came behind to stop Barcelona from triumphing in Seville. Assane Diao levelled in the 94th minute to stun Barcelona, who opened the scoring after 39 minutes through Robert Lewandowski. After Giovani Lo Celso levelled for the mid-table hosts from the penalty spot, substitute Ferran Torres struck what seemed the winner before Diao’s late intervention. Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said his team had to improve on the road, where most of their set-backs have come this season. ‘We have the quality to win every match but we also have to show that,’ said Flick. ‘(In) the away matches we have to be much stronger than we played here.’ Real Betis started strongly, with Raphinha forced to clear Diego Llorente’s header off his own goal-line. The electric Yamal helped Barcelona get on top as Betis sat deep and the Catalans found the breakthrough shortly before the break with a slick move finished by Lewandowski. It was the 36-year-old striker’s 16th league goal of the campaign and he leads the charts in Spain. The hosts levelled with a penalty converted by Lo Celso, when Frenkie de Jong stepped on the heel of Vitor Roque, on loan at Betis from Barca, with Flick sent off for protesting. ‘I’m really disappointed about (my red card), I thought that would never happen to me,’ Flick told reporters. Torres netted his second goal in two games to put Barca back in front before Diao struck late on. ‘I’m very happy with the goal,’ said the 19-year-old forward. ‘Now I want to go for more.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/252290/bellingham-and-mbappe-strike-as-madrid-beat-girona
United problems deepen as City stumble again,"Ruben Amorim's Manchester United honeymoon is truly over after Nottingham Forest inflicted a second straight Premier League defeat on his side on Saturday while Manchester City stumbled again. Leaders Liverpool maintained their seven-point lead at the top of the table even though their match at Everton was postponed because of storms on Merseyside. Amorim replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford last month after a terrible start to the season. He  began brightly, with a draw and two wins in his first three games. But reality is starting to bite hard after a 2-0 Premier League defeat at Arsenal in midweek followed by Saturday's chastening 3-2 loss to high-flying Forest, who capitalised on United's defensive blunders. United forward Rasmus Hojlund cancelled out Nikola Milenkovic's early goal at Old Trafford, but Morgan Gibbs-White and Chris Wood put the visitors in charge. Forest kept the home side at bay after Bruno Fernandes pulled one back. United's Andre Onana was embarrassed by a swerving Gibbs-White strike for Forest's second while the goalkeeper, Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs De Ligt all failed to deal with a looping Wood header for the third. The win lifts Forest to fifth in the Premier League table. United are languishing in 13th spot. ‘Tough game in a tough moment but we have to continue the job,’ a disappointed Amorim told the BBC. ‘This is a long journey. We are improving in some aspects. We have to win games to help us improve the team. ‘We are in the start of something so big that we pay attention to every detail. We already know it's a big job so we have to continue.’ Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo said ‘I'm very proud of the way we work together, build things together, from the owner to everyone else in the club. ‘It's a moment to celebrate. But for me, I'm thinking about (next week's match against) Aston Villa.’ Manchester City failed to win for the eighth time in nine games in a 2-2 draw at Crystal Palace. Pep Guardiola's men had the chance to go second in the table but failed to build on an encouraging 3-0 win over Forest in midweek. Daniel Munoz fired the home team ahead early but Erling Haaland's towering header levelled the score. The visitors started the second half strongly but were hit with a sucker punch when Maxence Lacroix powered home Will Hughes' corner. Rico Lewis found the top corner to level once more for City, but was then sent off six minutes from time. ‘We fought incredible. We came back twice,’ said Guardiola. ‘We gave everything and we take a point.’ Fourth-placed City are eight points behind Liverpool and a fifth straight Premier League title is looking increasingly unlikely. The final league derby between Everton and Liverpool at Goodison Park will be rescheduled after Storm Darragh battered western regions of England with high winds and heavy rain. Brentford enjoy the best home record in the division and made it seven wins from eight games at the Gtech Community Stadium with a thrilling 4-2 victory over Newcastle. Bryan Mbeumo, who has been linked with a move to the Magpies, opened the scoring with a sensational individual effort. Newcastle quickly levelled twice in the first half through Alexander Isak and Harvey Barnes, either side of Yoane Wissa's second for Brentford. But calamitous defending cost Newcastle in the second period when Nathan Collins prodded home from goalkeeper Mark Flekken's long ball forward. Kevin Schade then sealed the points for the Bees. ‘The players are growing, a lot of the players here for a while have taken another step up,’ said Brentford boss Thomas Frank, whose team are seventh in the table. ‘I would like to carry on this home form but some wins on the road would be welcome too.’ Aston Villa beat bottom-of-the-table Southampton 1-0 thanks to Jhon Duran's goal in his first Premier League start of the season. Liverpool's postponement means Arsenal and Chelsea have the chance the cut the gap at the top to four points on Sunday. The Gunners travel to Fulham while Chelsea are at Tottenham.

Inclusive education for all children demanded,"Government officials, educators and rights activists at a workshop on Saturday demanded ensuring inclusive and quality education for all children, including those with disabilities. No children should be deprived of education due to teacher crisis, lack of adequate educational materials and infrastructure, gender and cultural issues, they also mentioned.

Syria rebels say encircling Damascus,"Rebels on a lightning advance through Syria said on Saturday they have begun to encircle Damascus as government forces denied they had withdrawn from areas near the capital. ‘Our forces have begun the final phase of encircling the capital, Damascus,’ said rebel commander Hassan Abdel Ghani, with the Islamist-led alliance that launched the offensive. The defence ministry flatly denied the army had fled positions near the city. ‘There is no truth to news claiming our armed forces, present in all areas of the Damascus countryside, have withdrawn,’ it said. Earlier, a war monitor and Abdel Ghani said rebels were within 20 kilometres of Damascus as government forces fall back in the face of the offensive gathering even more momentum. The Syria Observatory for Human Rights said government forces had ceded more key ground, losing control of all of southern Daraa province and evacuating posts in Quneitra, near the Israel-annexed Golan Heights. The monitor said government forces were also pulling out of towns as little as 10 kilometres (six miles) from Damascus. Abdel Ghani said earlier that ‘our forces were able to control the Saasaa (security) branch in the Damascus countryside. The advance towards the capital continues.’ Air strikes and shelling by government forces and their ally Russia killed at least seven civilians near the city of Homs, as the army sought to slow the rebel advance there. The astounding rebel gains have brought the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and its allies to the doorstep of President Bashar al-Assad’s seat of power, just over a week into a renewed offensive in a conflict that had long seemed frozen. As the rebels seize more territory, they have also sought to reassure those living in areas now under their control. Abdel Ghani in a statement on Telegram Saturday recognised that the rebels had taken areas where ‘different religious sects and minorities’ live. ‘We ask that all sects be reassured... for the era of sectarianism and tyranny has gone away forever,’ he said. Minorities have often been persecuted during Syria’s long conflict, and HTS’s precursor Al-Nusra Front, which was linked to Al-Qaeda, launched deadly attacks on Assad’s Alawite minority in Homs early in the war. The army said it was redeploying in the south where the Observatory said the government had lost control of Daraa province and the key city of the same name, cradle of the 2011 uprising. An AFP correspondent in Daraa saw local fighters guarding public property and civil institutions on Saturday. In the central Homs area, a key stepping stone to the seat of power in Damascus, the Observatory said government forces had brought ‘large reinforcements’ and stopped the rebel advance. An army statement carried by state media said government forces were ‘redeploying and repositioning’ in the southern provinces of Sweida and Daraa. But both the Observatory and rebels said that government forces no longer controlled any of Daraa province. After the rebels seized Aleppo and Hama, Daraa was taken by local armed groups, the Britain-based monitor said. In nearby Quneitra province, government forces ‘evacuated military and security positions while civil servants left their posts, leaving the province... free of the Syrian army for the very first time’, said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. Daraa and Quneitra are near the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, where Israel said it was boosting its troop presence, and Jordan, which late Friday urged its citizens to leave Syria ‘as soon as possible’. Russia and the United States, which has troops in Syria as part of an anti-jihadist coalition, have also advised their nationals to leave. Syria’s civil war, which began with Assad’s crackdown on democracy protests, has killed more than 500,000 people and forced more than half the population to flee their homes. The HTS-led alliance has made rapid gains in the west since launching its offensive on November 27. By Friday, the government was also pulling its troops out of Deir Ezzor in the east, with Kurdish-led forces saying they had moved in. The HTS leader, known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, said in an interview published Friday the offensive’s aim was to oust Assad. ‘The goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime. It is our right to use all available means to achieve that goal,’ he told CNN. HTS is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda. Proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Western governments, it has sought to soften its image in recent years. The Kurdish-led and US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, which control territory in the east, expressed readiness for dialogue with rival rebels and Turkey, saying the offensive heralded a ‘new’ political reality for Syria. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for a ‘political solution to the conflict’ and for the protection of civilians and minorities, his spokesperson said Friday, in a call with Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan. In Hama, an AFP photographer saw residents set fire to a giant poster of Assad on the facade of city hall. ‘The rebels entered Hama, it was a great joy for us—something we had been waiting for since 2011,’ said Maymouna Jawad, expressing her hope that anti-government forces would ‘liberate’ the whole country. Online footage verified by AFP showed residents toppling a statue of Assad’s father Hafez, under whose brutal rule the army carried out a massacre in Hama in the 1980s.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252285/syria-rebels-say-encircling-damascus

Betis snatch late leveller to deny Liga leaders Barca,"La Liga leaders Barcelona dropped two points in the title race as Real Betis twice came from behind to snatch a 2-2 draw in an entertaining battle on Saturday. The Catalans moved five points clear of second-placed champions Real Madrid, who visit Girona later Saturday and also have another game in hand. Assane Diao levelled in the 94th minute to stun Barcelona, who opened the scoring after 39 minutes through Robert Lewandowski. After Giovani Lo Celso levelled for the mid-table hosts from the penalty spot, substitute Ferran Torres struck what seemed the winner before Diao's late intervention. ‘We weren't able to finish the game when we went ahead and defend the result,’ Torres admitted to Movistar. Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said his team had to improve on the road, where most of their set-backs have come this season. ‘We have the quality to win every match but we also have to show that,’ said Flick. ‘(In) the away matches we have to be much stronger than we played here.’ Real Betis started strongly, with Raphinha forced to clear Diego Llorente's header off his own goal-line. Former Barcelona winger Ez Abde should have sent Betis ahead moments later when played through but Inaki Pena produced a fine save. After Betis' early attacking flurry Barcelona began to take control of the game. The electric Yamal fired off-target from Raphinha's cross as both wingers threatened, with Betis sitting deep to try and protect themselves. The Catalans found the breakthrough shortly before the break with a slick team move. Pedri teed up Jules Kounde to slide across a low ball which Lewandowski stroked home from close range. It was the 36-year-old striker's 16th league goal of the campaign, leading the scoring charts in Spain.Betis began the second half in the same fashion as they started the first and came millimetres from an equaliser when Sergi Altimira's header flashed past Pena but also the far post. Barcelona goalkeeper Pena made a fine save to thwart Chimy Avila as Manuel Pellegrini's side held on to the initiative and eventually levelled with a penalty. Frenkie de Jong stepped on the heel of Vitor Roque, on loan at Betis from Barca, and after a VAR review the referee awarded the hosts a spot kick and sent off Flick for his protests. Lo Celso buried his penalty to set up an entertaining finale as both sides sought to claim three points. ‘I'm really disappointed about (my red card), I thought that would never happen to me,’ Flick told reporters. ‘But here, maybe it's like that, and I have to accept it. ‘It was really only a reaction (for) myself, nothing else -- I said nothing to anyone.’ Barcelona's winner arrived when 17-year-old starlet Yamal crossed for Torres to turn home, although the strike was initially flagged offside. However a VAR review showed Aitor Ruibal was late to step up and had played Spain international Torres onside for his second goal in two games. Barcelona thought they had sealed victory but deep in stoppage time Diao, left unmarked by Inigo Martinez, tucked home from Ruibal's cross as the full-back made amends for his earlier error. ‘We lost two points, we didn't play a good game, we didn't do everything we needed to bring (the points) home,’ Kounde told Barca One, the club's streaming platform. Betis coach Pellegrini felt his team, provisionally 11th, could have gone one better. ‘I think today we lost two points, we deserved more,’ said Pellegrini. ‘The performance leaves me very happy, but the result is bitter.’ ",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/252282/betis-snatch-late-leveller-to-deny-liga-leaders-barca
Indian media spreading rumours about Sunamganj incident,"National Citizens Committee member Manzoor Al Matin on Saturday blamed the Indian media for spreading rumours about the incident of Dowarabazar in Sunamganj. He said that Bangladesh was now a country of unity of different national minority communities, including Hindu and Muslim communities. When a group of local people was trying to attack houses of Hindus at Monglargaon under the Dowarabazar upazila over an incident of dishonouring the Holy Quran, the local Islamic scholars, including imams of mosques, protected them, Manzoor said. ‘This incident of communal harmony would be an example for entire Bangladesh,’ Manzoor claimed. He came up with comments while talking to journalists after visiting the Monglargaon village at noon. ‘The Indian media is spreading many lies and rumours about the attack on the Hindu community in Monglargaon,’ the NCC member Manzoor said, adding that the police administration should find out the truth over the incident and bring those involved in the attack to book. They wanted Akash Das, who insulted the Qur’an, punished, he said, adding that at the same time, the government must compensate those whose houses were damaged in the incident, Manzoor said. National Citizens Committee members Pritam Das and Tajnubha Jabin along with local leaders of the platform were present there at that time. On Tuesday evening, Akash Das, 21, son of Profulla Das of the Monglargaon village, allegedly posted a derogatory photo insulting Islam, and the status went viral quickly inciting reactions from among the people. Later, the police and army along with local Muslim clerics and political leaders brought the situation under control.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252281/indian-media-spreading-rumours-about-sunamganj-incident
Tarique for creating environment of accountability,"Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting chairperson Tarique Rahman on Saturday said that the party wanted to create an environment of accountability in every sector. Everyone from the union parishad member to the prime minister must be brought under accountability to address corruption and establish the rule of law, he said while virtually addressing a workshop held in Faridpur on the party’s 31-point state reform outline. The workshop was held at the Sadar Upazila Complex. Warning the party people against any misdeeds, Tarique said, ‘Some of us are making mistakes, but we need to correct them.  Otherwise, we have to be tougher.’ Saying that the biggest achievement of a political party was the trust it gained from people, he warned that if that trust was destroyed, the party could no longer exist. Addressing the party leaders and activists, he said, ‘Whatever strategy is needed to maintain the trust of the people, we must adopt it. This should be our pledge today.’ Referring to the fascist regime of the Awami League, he said, ‘Incidents of money laundering and corruption happened, and Tk 2,000 crore was laundered due to lack of political and other accountability during the Awami League tenure.’ ‘We want to ensure accountability at every stage, including for union parishad members, chairmen, lawmakers, ministers and the prime minister,’ he said. Stressing that BNP was a democratic political party, Tarique said, ‘As a political party, we want a fair and impartial election so that people can vote safely without fear.’ ‘We will definitely accept the verdict of the people in the elections, but everyone has to play a role in the polls, and we have to convey our 31-point state reform outline to all people, including the grassroots,’ he added. He further said, ‘Now various political figures and famous people are talking about state reforms, but everything is in our 31-point reform proposal.’ ‘We have forced the dictator to flee. The BNP did not do it alone, all the political parties and people from all classes and professions together did it,’ he said. He also added that collective efforts needed to do good work which could not be done alone.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/252280/tarique-for-creating-environment-of-accountability

JP seeks national unity to face aggression,"The Jatiya Party on Saturday sought an all-out national unity of political parties to face any aggression and overcome the current political situation in the country. Chairman of the party, Ghulam Muhammed Quader, came up with the call at a discussion arranged by the Jatiya Party at the chairman’s Banani office in Dhaka marking Constitution Protection Day.

"Govt offers land, interconnection for rapid solar expansion","The interim government has come up with a lucrative package for the expansion of solar energy, offering land and interconnection to the national grid, said energy adviser Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan. ‘We have big plans for solar energy expansion,’ said the adviser at a discussion organised by the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry at its auditorium on Saturday morning. Solar energy is viewed as the most potential solar energy source for Bangladesh. But the potential remained untapped, with the past Awami League government frequently citing land scarcity hindering solar expansion. The Bangladesh Power Development Board, Fouzul said, would soon start publishing open calls for 40 renewable energy projects, mostly solar power projects. The 40 projects had been initially rewarded by the immediate past government without bidding. The interim government has cancelled the approval for all of them and is going for open invitation. ‘Participating in the project would be like plug and play,’ said Fouzul, explaining that the investors would get land and the project ready. The solar power project would also enjoy tax exemption for 15 years, he said. Renewable energy currently accounts for less than 2 per cent of electricity consumption. Bangladesh’s current installed electricity generation capacity is 27,740MW. About 60 per cent of power generation in the country is dependent on imported fuel. Fuel imports, mainly liquefied natural gas import, drained the country’s foreign reserve, mostly since 2018. Energy experts at the discussion said that solar power could easily replace fuel oil consumption, particularly during summer, when up to 4,000MW is sourced from oil. Energy shortage has reduced production in industries by 35 per cent, said energy expert Mohammad Tamim in his keynote presentation in the discussion. ‘We have to keep importing fuel to minimise the energy crisis,’ he said. He predicted the gas crisis to persist for years to come and advised that the government could consider coal mining. Business leaders present at the discussion urged the government to supply gas to industries on priority. They argued that the industry sector ensures the best use of energy. Energy expert Ijaz Hossain reminded that disrupted industrial production meant drop in foreign currency income which would reinforce the ongoing energy crisis. Former Dhaka University teacher Badrul Imam said that Bangladesh was not supposed to have an energy crisis given its geological construction, indicative of sitting on a huge gas reserve. ‘Bangladesh could be sitting on one of the world’s largest gas reserve,’ said Badrul. ‘We don’t see any end in sight to the energy crisis because of our inactivity,’ he said. Bangladesh has one of the world’s highest gas discovery rates per drilling. Still, the country carried out almost no gas exploratory programme despite daunting energy crisis over the last decade. Instead, the country began importing LNG in 2018, causing energy prices to astronomically rise and eventually a prolonged spell of inflation aggravating the hardship particularly of the low-income people.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252272/govt-offers-land-interconnection-for-rapid-solar-expansion
Indian citizen held with bird nails at HSIA,"An Indian citizen, carrying four kilograms of bird nails, was arrested Friday night by customs officials and the forest department at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. The detained Jakir Hossain from West Bengal, holds an Indian passport. Wildlife inspector Ashim Mallick informed New Age on Saturday that a case was filed against Jakir with airport police station under the Special Powers Act, 1974, and Section 34(b) of the Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act, 2012. According to the case details, Jakir attempted to smuggle the bird nails disguised as ‘artificial’ cloth accessories, bypassing customs clearance. Upon receiving a tip-off from customs officials, the wildlife crime control unit of the forest department confiscated the nails and handed Jakir over to the police. During preliminary questioning, Jakir claimed the nails were destined for Dhaka’s Mirpur area. However, officials suspect they were ultimately bound for China. ‘The seized nails have an estimated market value of Tk 2.20 lakh, according to the case statement. Jakir is scheduled to be presented before a Dhaka court today,’ Ashim added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252271/indian-citizen-held-with-bird-nails-at-hsia
Int’l media unfairly portrays Bangladesh’s minority issue: press secy,"Chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam on Saturday said that the Bangladesh’s minority issue was unfairly portrayed in international media and influential nations’ top parliamentary hearings. He also urged secular newspapers and international rights groups to open probes into the alleged religious violence cases in Bangladesh. ‘When the Netra News debunked the Bangladesh Hindu Buddha Christian Unity Council’s report on the attacks on the Hindu community in the post-revolution days, I expected the group to make a statement,’ he said in a statement posted on his verified Facebook account. ‘After all, they were challenged by a top investigative website, which built its reputation by covering some of the biggest corruption and human rights violation stories in Bangladesh,’ he added. The press secretary said that the Netra News report showed almost all nine Hindu death, who the minority council claimed to have been killed in communal hatred-related violence, were connected to other reasons such as political, personal and other causes. ‘Our expectations were that the unity council would respond to the Netra News report, for it raises serious questions about the way the council collects and files reports on violence against minorities in Bangladesh,’ he said. He said that the unity council also made a similar controversial report on the attacks of minorities in Bangladesh in July last. ‘It said in the 2023-24 financial year, beginning on July 1, 2023, at least 45 people of minority faiths - mostly Hindus - were killed in the country. Again, Bangladeshi newspapers carried the story in their front and back pages. And not a single media outlet challenged the report despite there being serious questions about the veracity of unity’s claims,’ Shafiqul mentioned. Yet, according to the Ain o Salish Kendra, the country’s largest human rights group, no one was killed in anti-minority violence in 2023 and only two persons were killed in 2024, he said. Claiming that the Unity Council’s reports had a far-reaching impact, the press secretary said that when a British MP recently spoke about the attacks on minorities in Bangladesh, it seemed he quoted the council’s report. ‘What I’ve learnt is that the powerful and deep-pocketed Hindu American groups, Indian national and regional newspapers, and top Indian commentators cite its report to portray the state of minorities in Bangladesh. Experts told me the Unity Council’s reports have been the single biggest source of misinformation on anti-minority violence in Bangladesh,’ he added. The Human Rights Watch did an excellent investigation into the massacres of Hefazat activists in 2013, he mentioned, hoping that the rights group would do a similar probe. ‘Some even call for sending UN peacekeepers to Bangladesh - or intervening in the country - based on these reports and that is why the interim government wants fair investigations into the alleged cases of minority repression,’ he added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252270/intl-media-unfairly-portrays-bangladeshs-minority-issue-press-secy

Justice for climate change victims demanded,"Green activists and advisers to the interim government on Saturday at a conference demanded justice for climate change victims as it already had impacted life and livelihood of people. Green organisation Dhoritri Rokkhai Amra organized its two-day long second conference at the capital’s Liberation War Museum, said a press release. On the opening day, social welfare adviser Sharmeen Murshid said that if climate change could not be checked, it would destroy the civilisation. She said that the interim government would take proper measures to combat effects of climate change. ‘We are committed to implementing the law to save our water bodies and the environment,’ she said. Fisheries and livestock adviser Farida Akhter said that agricultural production and life and livelihood of people were highly impacted by climate change. She explained that for lack of inadequate rain on time production of hilsha declined. ‘We must give priority to agricultural production over the industrial one,’ she said. Dhoritri Rokkhai Amra adviser Mujibur Rahman Hawlader preferred renewable energy over coal-based power. The event organising committee member, Sharif Jamil, said that Bangladesh was one of the most vulnerable victim countries of the world due to climate change but Bangladesh was not responsible for it. Asian People’s Movement on Debt and Development coordinator Lidy Nacpil in a keynote paper said that climate change increased food insecurity and economic pressure on the people.

The event aimed to provide financial assistance to the families of those killed and injured during the uprising.

"Active family, community involvement sought against child trafficking","Child rights activists at a workshop on Saturday demanded active involvement of families and communities to prevent child trafficking. Nari Unnayan Shakti and the Bangladesh Shishu Adhikar Forum organised the event to raise awareness among adolescents about child rights, safety, and trafficking prevention, and to prepare them to play a leadership role in their respective communities.

Forum for Culture and Human Development executive director Sultan Muhammad Razzak called for everyone’s participation in ensuring child protection. Nari Unnayan Shakti executive director Afroja Parvin said that child abuse and trafficking are humanitarian crises. By raising awareness and enhancing the capacity of adolescents, a strong resistance to these issues can be built. Gram Bangla Development Committee director Khondkar Riaz Hossain said that to prevent abuse and violence against children, community-based child protection activities should be implemented, involving individuals from all levels — family, society, and the state.

South Korea president escapes impeachment,"South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol escaped impeachment Saturday over his brief declaration of martial law, after lawmakers from his ruling party boycotted a vote despite huge protests outside parliament. Yoon stunned the nation and the international community Tuesday night by suspending civilian rule and sending troops to  parliament, but was forced into a U-turn after lawmakers nixed his decree. Opposition parties proposed the impeachment motion, which needed a two thirds majority to pass, but a near-total boycott by Yoon’s People Power Party (PPP) doomed it to failure. ‘The number of members who voted did not reach the required two-thirds majority,’ National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik said, saying that as a result, the impeachment vote was ‘not valid’. The country—and the world—was watching, he said, adding it was ‘very regrettable that a vote could not even be held on such a significant national issue’. He said it signified ‘a failure to engage in the democratic process’ on the part of the ruling party. The PPP claimed after the vote that it had blocked the impeachment to avoid ‘severe division and chaos’, adding that it would ‘resolve this crisis in a more orderly and responsible manner’. The outcome disappointed the huge crowds—numbering 150,000 according to police, one million according to organisers—demonstrating outside parliament for Yoon’s ouster. Demonstrators booed while some sighed or even wept in frustration as the ruling party lawmakers walked out of the chamber. ‘Even though we didn’t get the outcome we wanted today, I am neither discouraged nor disappointed because we will get it eventually,’ said Jo Ah-gyeong, 30. ‘I’ll keep coming here until we get it,’ she told AFP. The opposition has already vowed to try again as soon as Wednesday, and many protesters vowed to continue demonstrations next weekend. ‘I will impeach Yoon Suk Yeol, who has become the worst risk for South Korea, at any cost,’ opposition leader Lee Jae-myung said. Before the vote, Yoon, 63, apologised for the turmoil but said he would leave it to his party to decide his fate. ‘I caused anxiety and inconvenience to the public. I sincerely apologise,’ he said in the televised address, his first public appearance in three days. He said he would ‘entrust the party with measures to stabilise the political situation, including my term in office’. The backing of PPP lawmakers came despite party head Han Dong-hoon—who was allegedly on an arrest list on Tuesday night—saying Yoon must go. Only three PPP lawmakers—Ahn Cheol-soo, Kim Yea-ji and Kim Sang-wook—voted in the end. The failure of the impeachment motion ‘means a more protracted political crisis,’ Vladimir Tikhonov, professor of Korean Studies at the University of Oslo, told AFP. ‘We will have a politically dead president—basically unable to govern any longer—and hundreds of thousands coming to the streets every week until Yoon is removed,’ he said. Had the motion passed, Yoon would have been suspended from duties pending a ruling by the Constitutional Court. An opinion poll released Friday put backing for the president at a record low of 13 percent. ‘The public will not forgive him,’ 63-year-old retiree Lee Wan-pyo told AFP at Seoul’s main train station before the vote. ‘I just want him to step down,’ said Han Jeong-hwa, a 70-year-old housewife. Regardless of the vote, police have begun investigating Yoon and others for alleged insurrection. In his address declaring martial law late Tuesday, Yoon claimed it would ‘eliminate anti-state elements plundering people’s freedom and happiness’. Security forces sealed the National Assembly, helicopters landed on the roof and almost 300 soldiers tried to lock down the building. But as parliamentary staffers blocked the soldiers with sofas and fire extinguishers, enough MPs got inside—many climbed walls to enter—and voted down Yoon’s move. Soldiers had been ordered to detain key politicians, officials from both parties have said, with the special forces chief later describing being given orders to ‘drag out’ MPs from parliament. Experts and lawmakers have speculated that the elite special forces soldiers may have slow-walked following orders, after discovering themselves to be involved in a political rather than national security incident. The episode brought back painful memories of South Korea’s autocratic past and blindsided its allies, with the US administration only finding out via television. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yul on Friday that he ‘expects the... democratic process to prevail’.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/252263/south-korea-president-escapes-impeachment
Bangladesh national injured in BSF firing,"A Bangladesh national was injured in firing by the Indian Border Security Force in the Kutirpar border area of Aditmari upazila in Lalmonirhat early Saturday. The injured is Helaluzzaman, also known as Helal Uddin, 36, son of late Shahabuddin of Kutirpar village of Durgapur union of the upazila. The incident took place inside Indian territory in the pillar 925/2 area of Kutirpar border under Durgapur union of the upazila. BGB Lalmonirhat 15 Battalion Commander Lieutenant Colonel Shah Md Shakil Alam said that they protested at the incident and asked the BSF to return the Bangladeshi national. Durgapur union parishad member Abdur Razzak said that Helal often entered Indian territory illegally in search of work. ‘He returned home after working for a few months. While returning home, he was injured when members of Madankura camp of the BSF fired rubber bullets at him,’ he said. Later, he was admitted to Dinhata Sadar Hospital in India by BSF personnel, where he was undergoing treatment, according to local sources. Local sources said that a group of Bangladeshis, including Helal, entered India illegally on Friday night.

BNP urges govt to give election roadmap,"The Bangladesh Nationalist Party on Saturday urged the interim government for a roadmap without delay to hold the national elections and also condemned India saying that it was trying to mislead the global community by spreading disinformation about Bangladesh. Speaking as the chief guest at a discussion organised by the National People’s Party at the National Press Club, BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain urged the interim government to give an election roadmap immediately. Khandaker Mosharraf said that the people must be mobilised towards the elections with a polls roadmap and that is the way to crush   the plots of the defeated forces. Conspiracies and instability would only increase if the government remained in power indefinitely by talking about reforms. Mosharraf warned that the people’s right to vote must be restored immediately, because if the government could not be changed through votes, the people would send them away. It was possible to counter anti-Bangladesh conspiracies if the people were mobilised for elections, he also said. On another occasion on the day, BNP senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said that India was trying to mislead the global communities by spreading false information about Bangladesh, but all their effort would be futile in this era of technology. Rizvi’s remarks came while he was talking to journalists after visiting the patients who were injured during the July-August student-led mass uprising at National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery in the capital. He said that politicians, policymakers and media of the neighbouring country were shedding crocodile tears for the dictator who fled there and trying to mislead the world by spreading disinformation that Hindus were burnt to death along with their homes in Bangladesh. But in this era of technology, their ill attempts would not succeed, he said. ‘We knew India as a democratic country, where many intelligent and talented people live, but now it seems that violent murderers are living in that country,’ the BNP leader said. Rizvi also said, ‘They (India) have torn the flag of our beloved motherland, and they insulted diplomats. According to the Vienna Convention, this is a serious international offence.’ He also slammed Delhi for shedding ‘crocodile tears’ for Chinmoy [Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, a Hindu religious leader], saying that India was doing this only to protect Sheikh Hasina. He stated that it could not continue because Bangladesh was an independent and sovereign country.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/252260/bnp-urges-govt-to-give-election-roadmap
Protests continue,"The Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s associate bodies will bring out a march towards the Indian High Commission in Dhaka city today amid ongoing protests against the attack on Bangladesh mission at Agartala. The party fronts, its student wing Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, youth front Jatiyatabadi Juba Dal and its volunteer wing Jatiyatabadi Swechchhasebak Dal have announced that they will also give a memorandum protesting at the attack and hatching of a conspiracy allegedly to incite ‘communal riots’ in Bangladesh. A joint statement signed by Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal office secretary Md Jahangir Alam read that the procession would march from the BNP’s central office at Naya Paltan towards the Indian  High Commission in Dhaka’s Gulshan. A group of retired Armed Forces officers, meanwhile, under the banner of the ‘National unity and solidarity council,’ on Saturday urged all to unite against what they described as an Indian aggression, United News of Bangladesh reported. Retired Colonel Ahsan Ullah, a freedom fighter and the convener of the organisation, came up with the call while speaking at a rally organised protesting at the attack on the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala, Tripura on December 2. They brought out a procession from Mohakhali’s Raowa Complex that concluded at the same location after marching through Bijoy Sarani area around 10:00am. Expressing deep concern over the attack, the speakers said that since the July-August mass uprising the Indian media launched a propaganda campaign against Bangladesh. The attack on the Bangladesh mission demonstrated India’s policy of dominance and aggression and India must understand that the people of Bangladesh would not tolerate any attempt to undermine the sovereignty of their country, they said. The protest against the mission attack continued for the sixth day running on Saturday in the capital and elsewhere in the country. The Bangladesh mission in Agartala came under attack in the afternoon of December 2 by a group of Indians during their protests demanding the release of Hindu community leader in Bangladesh Chinmoy Krishna Das, now in jail in a sedition case. Amid growing tension between the two neighbouring countries, the Border Guard Bangladesh remains on alert to prevent any untoward situation, according to BGB officials. Security measures of the Indian High Commission in Dhaka and other Indian missions in the country’s other cities have been tightened since the Agartala attack. BNP senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said on another occasion on the day that India was trying to mislead the global community by spreading false information about Bangladesh, but all their attempts would fail in this era of technology. Rizvi’s remarks came while he was talking to journalists after visiting the patients who were injured during the July-August student-led mass uprising at National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery in the capital.

Low teacher pay harms education,"Teachers continue to go underpaid compared with their fellows in other Asian countries which squarely affects the quality of education, the white paper on the state of the Bangladesh economy says. The average salary of a primary school teacher is about 27 per cent less than the average monthly per capita income and the low pay demotivates some university teachers to carry out research. If teachers fail to maintain a modest standard of living with their salary, they cannot be expected to produce an optimum level of intellectual output, states the white paper. Skilled and meritorious teachers, especially at the elementary level, are a must to build the foundation of quality education, educationsists observed. Teachers should be paid the highest salaries and dignities, they said, urging the interim government to reform the sector bypassing partisan opinions. A 12-member committee headed by economist Debapriya Bhattacharya prepared the white paper and submitted it to chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on December 1. In a section titled Career Mobility for Teachers, the white paper highlights that the government is responsible for ensuring primary education for all. Primary education was made compulsory in the country in 1993. The white paper states that the average salary of a primary school teacher in Bangladesh is $170.02, about 27 per cent less than the average monthly per capita income of the country. The monthly per capita income of Bangladesh is $232 as the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics shows the annual per capita income of Bangladesh at $2784 in the financial year 2023-24. The average monthly salary of a primary school teacher is $953.13 in Maldives, $284.64 in India, $250.44 in Sri Lanka, $206.07 in Pakistan and $189.22 in Myanmar, the white paper shows. ‘In terms of primary school teachers’ salaries, Bangladesh ranks 45th among Asian countries and 7th in South Asia,’ it read, adding, ‘in our national pay scale, primary school teachers are placed at a very low level.’ The paper also shows that an entry-level teacher or lecturer at universities in Bangladesh earns between $220 and $482 per month which, in contrast, ranges $770 to $2,420 in India,  $700 to $2,800 in Malaysia and $2,950 to $10,300 in Singapore. ‘Higher salaries, allowances and dignities for the teachers must be ensured for quality education,’ said Rasheda K Choudhury, executive director of the Campaign for Popular Education. She also said that the government should introduce cadre-facility in the primary education level to attract skilled and meritorious students in the teaching profession. BRAC University distinguished professor Mohammad Kaykobad said tha without quality teachers it would not be possible to sustain in the current world. For quality teachers, they should be paid well, he added. ‘Highest salary should be paid to the teachers from the elementary level to the basic level till Class XII to ensure quality of education,’ said Quazi Faruque Ahmed, a member of the Education Policy 2010 formulation committee. The government should reform this sector bypassing all partisan opinions, said Quazi Faruque, also member of the Asia-South Pacific Association for Basic and Education Capacity Support. An assistant teacher at government primary schools in the country receives about Tk 19,000 in monthly salary under the 13th grade of national pay scale, the white paper mentions. Studies show that the monthly food expense for a family of four in Dhaka is Tk 22,664 which is too high for a primary school teacher to manage. Kaykobad also said that the tendency to appoint unskilled teachers with much lower salary at the whim of some private schools also severely affected the quality of education. The primary school teachers are still paid according to the national pay scale 2015, with no adjustment for the inflation which stands at more than 9 per cent after sharp increases in the past couple of years. The low pay also demotivates some teachers from allocating much time to the university while some even stop research after becoming a professor. ‘It is to be noted that, the culture of political criminalisation in the educational institutions has a much deeper social effect, as these teachers will be there for teaching for the next 30 years or so,’ the white paper continues. The whole culture has been nurtured in such a way that the collusive political and bureaucratic decision making process overruled the social dignity of teachers, it says. Teaching is a profession that, the report adds, needs a certain salary without any comparison with other professions.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/education/252258/low-teacher-pay-harms-education
Bangladesh women suffer crushing defeat,"The Bangladesh Under-21 women’s hockey team made a disastrous start in the Women’s Junior Asia Cup when they conceded a 19-0 defeat to China in the Pool A first game in Muscat, Oman, on Saturday.

Financial barrier is our biggest hurdle: Taibur,"When the National Sports Council authorised the ad-hoc committee of nine federations in mid-November, FIDE masterTaibur Rahmanwas appointed general secretary of the Bangladesh Chess Federation. In an interview withNew Age’sWahid Ullah Bakul, the 48-year-old chess player and government employee discussed the present state of chess in the country as well as his game development goals. Here are the excerpts: New Age: What challenges are you facing after taking charge of the Bangladesh Chess Federation’s ad-hoc committee? Taibur Rahman:The main challenge is to overcome the financial crisis. Otherwise, I don’t see any big challenges. I have been playing chess for over 30 years; I know what needs to be done for the development of the game, including having a new Grandmaster within a short period. NA: Would you please specify the needs? Taibur:We must host at least four to six international tournaments every year and ensure long-term training at home and abroad. Besides, the organisers must emphasise on the grassroots level, where we hardly focused before. We need to host at least two tournaments in each district every year. And the new players must be groomed through proper arrangements, keeping them engaged for six months of training, four months in home-based competitions, and two months in away competitions in a year. NA: Bangladesh produced South Asia’s first GM in 1987, a year before India. So far now we have a total of five GMs, and India produced over 90 GMs. Why are we lagging behind? Taibur:It is mainly because of our economic structure of chess. It will be an unfair comparison if you look at the Indian chess authority’s support, which includes the availability and access to well-structured venues, the number of chess academies, the quantity of prize money, job opportunities, and other incentives. NA: What is the prospect of chess in Bangladesh, and how could we get more GMs? Taibur:If you provide me with the necessary resources, I can promise you to produce our next Grandmaster by 2025. Currently, we have two potential FIDE masters—Manon Reja Neer and Mohammad Fahad Rahman—in the pipeline to become Grandmasters. To achieve this, we need resources to ensure uninterrupted training facilities and regular participation in international competitions. If we want to have more GMs, we have to bring competitiveness in chess by raising the number of the FIDE-listed players. NA: As you mentioned about the financial crisis, how would you overcome this challenge? Taibur:I am a bit worried about managing the funds. So far now, I have approached the organisers of the Math Olympiad committee to incorporate chess alongside their Olympiad event. I think it will be cost-effective to reach 50 to 60 thousand chess players each year. One of our members pledged financial support to reach 10 thousand school students. NA: What are your other plans? Taibur:We are in search of a sponsor so that we can appoint a foreign coach within a short time for the national players. We want to produce the next Grandmaster soon. I can assure you that we have enough talents; they just need proper nursing. But unfortunately, currently we have no chess academy. Besides, we have only one venue at the NSC old building, which is not even enough to host the national league. I’m looking for more permanent venues and have already written to both [Dhaka North and South] city corporations.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/chess/252255/financial-barrier-is-our-biggest-hurdle-taibur
Soumya fires Rangpur to GSL title,"Soumya Sarkar struck a whirlwind knock as Rangpur Riders clinched the maiden edition of the Global Super League T20 title with a crushing 56-run win over Australian domestic side Victoria at the Providence Stadium in Guyana, West Indies, on Saturday. The victory completed a fairytale finish for Rangpur, who lost their first two matches, including one against Victoria by 10 runs in the group phase that raised their prospect of an early exit from the race. But thereafter they won two straight matches in the group phase and moved to the final on a better run rate before securing the trophy in style. Soumya blasted a 54-ball 86 not out with seven fours and five sixes to lift the side to a decent 178-3 after captain Nurul Hasan Sohan won the toss and elected to bat first. The bowlers complemented Soumya’s effort with an excellent bowling show that wrapped up Victoria’s innings for just 122 in 18.1 overs. A total of five domestic franchisees from five different countries took part in the maiden edition of the tournament. From Australia, Victoria, Pakistan’s Super League team Lahore Qalandars, England’s Hampshire, West Indies’ Caribbean Premier League side Guyana Amazon Warriors, and Bangladesh Premier League side Rangpur participated in the tournament. Soumya was ably supported by his opening partner, Steven Taylor, who hammered 68 off 49 with the help of four boundaries and as many sixes. They put on 124 runs for the opening partnership, Riders’s highest partnership on the first wicket. After the dismissal of Taylor, Soumya single-handedly drove the side to a respectable total as the other batters failed to come to terms. Rangpur bowlers, led by Harmeet Singh’s 3-19, ripped through Victoria to bring the laurel for the side. Off-spinner Mahedi Hasan, leg-spinner Rishad Hossain, and occasional bowler Saif Hassan took two wickets apiece to further derail Victoria. Opener Joe Clarke was the top scorer for the side with a 22-ball 40, while Blake Macdonald was the other notable scorer with 16.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252254/soumya-fires-rangpur-to-gsl-title-

Electing to bat first, Ireland racked up 134-5 before bowling out Bangladesh for just 87 in 17.1 overs with Irish pacer Orla Prendergast taking 3-13. This was Bangladesh’s lowest total against Ireland. Bangladesh captain Nigar Sultana Joty rued her team’s batting performance though she was content with the bowlers’ efforts. ‘We bowled better today. Sobhana and Dilara batted really well in the previous match, it was unfortunate they couldn’t bat well today,’ said Joty after the match. Bangladesh batters had shown promise in the first match, but they failed to carry that momentum, as openers Dilara Akter (10) and Sobhana Mostary (1) were both dismissed by Prendergast in her first two overs. Joty (six) also had a brief stay, getting castled by Arlene Kelly and Alana Dalzell snapped Taj Nehar (two) to leave Bangladesh crawling at 22-4 inside the powerplay. Sharmin Akhter and Shorna Akter then tried to revive their innings with a cautious stand of 48 runs for the fifth wicket until Laura Delany (2-16) broke through in the 13th over. Shorna had to depart for 20 and Sharmin scored team’s highest 38 off 43 balls aided by one boundary. Followed that, Bangladesh ended up losing six of their batters for 17 runs. Joty credited the Irish bowlers for executing their plans well in a sporting Sylhet wicket and lauded batter Sharmin for her mettle. ‘Sharmin batted really well, but we kept losing wickets at regular intervals. The credit goes to Irish team , they bowled according to the plans,’ said Joty. Earlier, Bangladesh women’s restricted Ireland to 134-5, led by left-arm spinner Nahida Akter, who finished with 2-20 in her four overs. Jahanara Alam, Jannatul Ferdous, and Fahima Khatun each took a wicket. Delany was the top scorer for Ireland with 35 runs, while Prendergast added 32. The Irish started cautiously with an opening partnership of 34 runs from 35 balls. Then Nahida’s pivotal wicket of skipper Gaby Lewis (14) came in the final delivery of the powerplay, breaking the partnership. Followed that, Ireland lost wickets at regular wickets and ultimately finished with what appeared to be a below-par total. The third and final T20I will be held at the same venue on Monday.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252253/bangladesh-succumb-to-series-defeat
Tigers out to maintain supremacy over WI,"Bangladesh will be looking to continue their 50-over format supremacy over the West Indies when the two sides face off in the first of the three-match ODI series at Warner Park in Basseterre, St Kitts today. The match starts at 7.30pm Bangladesh Standard Time and T Sports and Nagorik TV televise the match live. Bangladesh have played a very low number of ODI series this year, with the series against the Caribbean side being their third. That means they will play a maximum of nine ODIs—their lowest since 2016. This year has been a mixed bag for them with a 50-50 win-loss ratio. Bangladesh won the series 2-1 against Sri Lanka in March at home while losing 1-2 to Afghanistan in the UAE last month. But when it comes to the West Indies, Bangladesh have an 11-match winning streak against the Caribbean side stretching back to December 2018. They have won the past four ODI series against the West Indies. Bangladesh will also certainly be motivated with the recent result in the Jamaica Test, where they turned things around to win by 101 runs and that too, with the absence of the likes of Mushfiqur Rahim and Najmul Hossain Shanto—the regular captain. They both continue to be absent as Mehidy Hasan Miraz will again lead the side. Bangladesh will miss Towhid Hridoy, as he was also declared unfit by the BCB’s medical team due to a groin injury. Not only that, senior pacer Mustafizur Rahman is also unavailable as he’s on paternity leave. There is also no Shakib Al Hasan, as the former captain’s future remains uncertain. Despite the absence of the big names, some players are making a comeback. Liton Das and Tanzim Hasan missed the Afghanistan series due to injuries, while Afif Hossain last played in the format a year ago. Tanzim and Afif recently took part in the inaugural Global Super League in Guyana. Tanzim played for the Guyana Amazon Warriors, whereas Afif represented eventual champions, Rangpur. Tanzim, the 22-year-old pacer, is excited to represent the national team again. ‘I came here after a minor injury, but I don’t feel like I›ve come back from an injury,’ said Tanzim. ‘I’m feeling well, Alhamdulillah. My bowling is okay now;  my mentality is good.’ Nahid Rana, the new pace sensation, will also be ready to stir a storm as he did in the second Test. The 22-year-old fast bowler remains unperturbed with all the hype around him. ‘I don’t think about what’s going on the internet,’ said the speedstar from Chapainawabganj. ‘I’m just focusing on my performance. Learning is a never-ending process. I’ve learnt how to bowl in these kinds of conditions.’ The Warner Park also holds happy memories for the Tigers, as it is where the winning streak against the West Indies started for the Tigers in 2018. In fact, the Warner Park hasn’t hosted an ODI since then. The ground is typically a high-scoring one, as the average winnings score in the first innings has been 313 so far. The teams batting first also dominated as they won 13 out of 18 matches played here.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252252/tigers-out-to-maintain-supremacy-over-wi-
Gaza genocide and Israeli hasbara,"THE ongoing war and genocide in Gaza is unprecedented. Nothing that Israel and its supporters can say or do will avoid the historical accountability of the extermination of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip. The above assertion is critical, both for ending the Israeli occupation of Palestine and achieving Palestinian freedom. This is why. In all past wars and adjoining war crimes, Israel managed to push the reset button in its relationship with occupied Palestinians. Following each war, the Israeli hasbara, propaganda machine, would start — utilising the always-willing western mainstream media — to paint Palestinians in a negative light and to present Israel, a country that is supposedly in a permanent state of self-defence, as the victim, or even the lone defender of western civilisation. This campaign is always paralleled with the whitewashing of Israel in popular entertainment, from Hollywood movies to TV sit-coms, to magazine covers with such titles as ‘Gorgeous Photos Capture The Unseen Lives Of Female Soldiers In Israel.’ Generally, western politicians of varied ideologies, along with intellectuals, news talking heads and church leaders all praise, in tandem, the miracle that is Israel. At the beginning of Israel’s genocidal war in October 2023, for example, British playwright Tom Stoppard said that ‘before we take up a position on what’s happening now, we should consider whether this is a fight over territory or a struggle between civilisation and barbarism.’ He, of course, leaned towards the latter. This Israeli tactic always includes the demonisation of Palestinians as well, where the victim becomes the ‘terrorist’ and those under siege become the besiegers. This last claim, in particular, was expressed in the words of former US secretary of state Madeline Albright who said, in an interview with NBC in August 2000, that ‘the Israelis feel under siege from the Palestinian rock throwers and the various gangs that have been roaming around.’ Why will those same Israeli tactics fail this time? Indeed, they will fail, not due to Israel’s lack of trying. In fact, Israel is already bracing for the fight of a lifetime. One new tactic that Israel is already employing in ‘friendly’ countries, like the United States, is the passing of laws to block the mere conversation on the Israeli genocide in Gaza, so that it will have exclusive access to the American public. On November 14, the US House of Representatives passed two bills: HR6408 and HR9495. The latter, in particular, aimed at giving the Treasury secretary the authorisation to revoke an organisation’s tax-exempt status and decide when the designation would end. Once these bills pass the Senate and are approved by the president, the most democratic and peaceful expressions of rejecting the Israeli occupation of Palestine and demanding sensible US foreign policy will be equated to a direct violation of the law and, in some cases, to terrorism — as defined by the Department of Treasury, at the behest of the pro-Israeli lobby. But even these desperate attempts will not quell the anger or distract from the conversation, for the following reasons: One, not only did Israel commit genocide in the Gaza Strip, but this genocide and extermination are being investigated and are acknowledged by the world’s largest legal institutions, namely the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court. Two, unlike previous investigations, for example, the Goldstone Report probing the 2008–09 war on Gaza, the international community has already taken some practical steps to hold Israeli war criminals accountable, including an arrest warrant issued on November 21 against Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant. Three, those who routinely come to Israel’s defence, the US and other western governments, are now directly clashing with the very international law they helped articulate after World War II, depriving them of any credibility as ‘neutral’ parties in this conflict. For example, Biden said that the warrants were ‘outrageous’ while the French ministry for Europe and foreign affairs claimed that Netanyahu and other ministers enjoy immunity since Israel is not a party to the ICC. Four, despite the inherent bias of western media, Palestinian journalists, isolated and killed in large numbers, managed to communicate the genocide to the rest of the world, making it impossible for Israel to hide its crimes. Five, the impact of the Israeli genocide on Gaza has already penetrated the various layers of public opinion, unprecedented in history. Typically, the conversation on Palestine is confined to specific strata of society, reaching academics, social justice activists and other groups interested in politics and global issues. Today, ordinary people have been made aware of the conversation, to the extent that it is widely believed that anger over Gaza has contributed in determining the outcome of the latest US elections. In Africa, the growing political and public interest in the Palestinian struggle have re-enlivened the spirit of anti-colonial, liberation struggles on the continent, bringing many countries, from South Africa to Algeria, back to the frontlines of global solidarity. No amount of Israeli propaganda, unjust laws, unfair categorisations of Palestinians or the hardly-clad models of the IDF, will ever succeed in reversing these realities. Now, there can be no reset buttons. Rather, the global momentum of Palestine’s liberation will accelerate in the coming months and years. The price exacted from the Palestinian people for this earth-shattering moment has been high and painful, but the history of all national liberation struggles, Palestine included, demonstrates that the price for freedom is always high.

Reclaiming Bangladesh’s promise,"BANGLADESH stands at a pivotal moment in its history, having embarked on a bold and transformative journey following the July-August 2024 uprising. This historic uprising was not merely a spontaneous event but a culmination of the people’s long-suppressed aspirations for justice, equity, and democratic governance. For years, the nation endured systemic corruption, autocratic rule, and economic mismanagement under the previous regime, leading to widespread discontent. The uprising became a symbol of hope and resilience, as citizens from all walks of life came together to demand a better future, one rooted in fairness, accountability, and the rule of law. Amid this period of transition, the appointment of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as the head of the interim government on August 8, 2024, marked a turning point. Known globally as a pioneer of microfinance and an advocate for poverty alleviation, Yunus brings to the role not only his visionary leadership but also an impeccable reputation as a statesman committed to empowering the underprivileged. His stature and credibility on the world stage have inspired confidence both within Bangladesh and internationally, enabling the country to navigate this complex and challenging period with renewed optimism. Yunus, supported by a team of capable advisors, has wasted no time in addressing the urgent issues left by the fallen regime. The challenges are monumental — ranging from economic instability and deteriorating law and order to systemic corruption and weakened institutions. Yet, the interim government has shown remarkable determination in tackling these problems head-on, implementing reforms aimed at stabilising the economy, restoring peace, and rebuilding the nation’s image on the global stage. This government’s efforts represent more than just governance; they symbolise a collective commitment to reclaim the values of democracy and justice that have been the backbone of Bangladesh’s national identity. As the country charts its course toward sustainable development and democracy, the leadership of Yunus embodies the aspirations of a people yearning for a fresh start. His global reputation, built on decades of advocacy for inclusive growth and social justice, positions him uniquely to steer Bangladesh through this transformative era. By combining visionary policymaking with a grassroots approach to empowerment, the interim government has set the stage for a new chapter in Bangladesh’s history — one that promises hope, progress, and a brighter future for all.  Steps taken by government Economic revitalisation: The interim government has prioritised the revival of Bangladesh’s struggling economy, which had been pushed to the brink of collapse by years of mismanagement and corruption. Comprehensive measures have been implemented to stabilise the financial sector, including stringent fiscal policies, reorganisation of banking institutions, and initiatives to curb inflation. Special focus has been placed on fostering entrepreneurship by creating a conducive environment for small and medium-sized enterprises and startups to thrive. The government has also actively sought to attract foreign direct investment by offering incentives, simplifying bureaucratic processes, and showcasing the country’s potential in sectors such as textiles, technology, and renewable energy. Additionally, the interim administration has reinvigorated the microfinance sector, recognising its historical significance in empowering millions of underprivileged Bangladeshis. Through targeted programmes, marginalised communities are being provided access to affordable credit, enabling them to start small businesses and improve their livelihoods. This approach not only strengthens the economic foundation of the country but also promotes social equity and inclusivity. Reforming governance: One of the most critical steps taken by the interim government has been the introduction of sweeping reforms in governance to dismantle the corrupt systems left by the previous administration. In the education sector, outdated curricula are being revamped to align with global standards, and measures are being implemented to ensure access to quality education for all. The health sector is witnessing a revitalisation through the establishment of new healthcare facilities, improved medical services, and expanded insurance coverage for low-income families. In public administration, the government has taken bold steps to increase transparency and accountability. A robust anti-corruption drive has been launched, with numerous investigations and prosecutions targeting individuals and entities involved in illicit activities. Digital governance initiatives are being introduced to reduce bureaucratic inefficiency and make public services more accessible and user-friendly. These reforms are laying the groundwork for a government that operates with integrity, efficiency, and a focus on serving the people. Besides this, there are six separate commissions that have been formed to carry out reforms in the judiciary, constitution, election commission, civil administration, and police force. Strengthening law and order: Recognising that peace and security are prerequisites for progress, the interim government has empowered law enforcement agencies to restore law and order across the country. Police forces and intelligence agencies have been provided with enhanced training, resources, and technology to address rising crime rates and tackle organised criminal networks. Special task forces have been formed to suppress political unrest, prevent acts of sabotage, and counter any attempts to destabilise the government. Efforts are also underway to ensure accountability within law enforcement agencies themselves, fostering public trust. At the national level, border security measures have been intensified to safeguard sovereignty and prevent cross-border smuggling and infiltration, which have historically posed significant challenges to Bangladesh’s stability. Besides these, the army has also been deployed in aid of civil power with magistracy power to restore the broken law and order situation in the country. Building an international image: Muhammad Yunus’s global reputation as a Nobel Laureate and advocate of economic and social empowerment is being leveraged to repair Bangladesh’s tarnished international image. The interim government has undertaken a proactive diplomatic campaign to strengthen bilateral and multilateral relationships, showcasing the nation’s commitment to reform and progress. Engagements with international organisations, financial institutions, and foreign governments have been prioritised to attract developmental aid, secure favourable trade agreements, and build strategic alliances. The government is also actively countering negative propaganda in foreign media by promoting stories of positive change, highlighting the country’s resilience, and presenting Bangladesh as a stable and emerging economic hub in South Asia. Through these efforts, Bangladesh is gradually regaining its standing as a responsible and forward-looking member of the global community. The interim government’s approach emphasises not only domestic stability but also integration into the broader global framework, ensuring a brighter future for the nation.  Challenges from enemies Internal challenges: The interim government’s ambitious reform agenda has encountered significant internal resistance from entrenched interest groups, political opportunists, and detractors seeking to derail its progress. These internal adversaries have been emboldened by decades of systemic corruption and patronage networks that thrived under the previous regime. As the government works to dismantle these structures, vested interests are actively resisting change to protect their privileges and power. One of the most pervasive threats comes from misinformation campaigns designed to erode public trust in the interim administration. Social media platforms have become a battleground for the spread of fake news, half-truths, and incendiary propaganda. These campaigns exploit the general public’s frustrations and uncertainties, creating confusion and division. False narratives are being crafted to question the legitimacy of the government’s actions, downplay its achievements, and amplify dissent. Moreover, elements loyal to the previous regime are collaborating with criminal networks to disrupt law and order, staging protests, strikes, and violent demonstrations to destabilise the country. This orchestrated unrest not only threatens peace but also diverts government resources away from critical reforms and development initiatives. Foreign-backed internal sabotage: Certain groups within Bangladesh have also aligned themselves with foreign powers to undermine the interim government. These alliances often stem from ideological sympathies or material benefits and pose a serious risk to national sovereignty. By funding protests, spreading disinformation, and supporting extremist activities, these factions aim to discredit the administration and derail its reform agenda. Such actions are not merely political opposition; they represent calculated attempts to create chaos, disunity, and distrust among the population. This environment of unrest weakens the government’s ability to govern effectively and provides justification for external actors to meddle in Bangladesh’s internal affairs. External challenges: On the international front, Bangladesh faces scrutiny and criticism from geopolitical rivals and detractors, particularly within the South Asian region. These critics, often driven by their own strategic interests, exploit the country’s transitional phase to undermine its global standing. Some foreign governments and media outlets have amplified negative narratives about the interim administration, portraying its efforts as authoritarian or ineffective without acknowledging the complexity of the issues it inherited. Regional rivalries further exacerbate the situation. Competing nations view Bangladesh’s rise as a threat to their influence and are leveraging diplomatic channels, economic tools, and covert operations to destabilise the country. For instance, foreign entities may provide financial and logistical support to domestic opposition groups, fund propaganda campaigns, or influence public opinion through biased reporting in international media. Impact of rumours and propaganda: Both internally and externally, misinformation and propaganda have become powerful weapons against the interim government. Unsubstantiated rumours about government policies, fabricated stories of corruption, and exaggerated reports of unrest are being circulated widely to create panic and disillusionment. Foreign media outlets and think tanks with hidden agendas have painted a distorted image of the government, often ignoring its successes or portraying its necessary reforms as repressive measures. These narratives erode confidence among international investors and development partners, hampering the country’s efforts to rebuild its economy and improve global relations. Toxic atmosphere of distrust: The cumulative effect of these internal and external challenges is a toxic atmosphere of distrust. This distrust weakens the national unity needed to implement reforms and achieve stability. Citizens, caught between competing narratives, may become disillusioned, apathetic, or even antagonistic toward the government, making it harder to foster collective action and resolve.  Path forward TO COMBAT these challenges, the interim government must adopt a multipronged strategy. Internally, it must strengthen its communication channels to provide accurate information, counter misinformation, and engage with the public transparently. Collaboration with civil society, community leaders, and independent media can help amplify the truth and foster trust. Externally, diplomatic efforts should focus on building strong alliances with supportive nations, engaging with global institutions, and countering negative narratives through credible platforms. At the same time, it is essential to remain vigilant against foreign interference and to enhance the nation’s cybersecurity and intelligence capabilities to thwart attempts at destabilization. Unity among patriotic citizens, along with steadfast government action, will be crucial to overcoming these internal and external adversities and ensuring that the reforms achieve their intended goals.  People’s role AT THIS pivotal moment in Bangladesh’s history, the role of its citizens cannot be overstated. The success of the interim government’s reform agenda and the country’s transition toward a brighter future depend on the collective resolve, unity, and active participation of the people. Here’s how citizens can contribute to this transformative journey: Support the government: In times of transition, unwavering public support for the interim government is vital to ensure stability and progress. Citizens must recognise that the government’s efforts to rebuild the economy, reform governance, and restore peace are in their best interests. Supporting these initiatives means cooperating with government policies, respecting the rule of law, and encouraging others to participate in nation-building activities. Public support can also manifest in simple yet impactful ways, such as participating in community programs, providing constructive feedback on reforms, and standing against actions that disrupt progress. By rallying behind the interim government, citizens can help create an environment where reforms can be effectively implemented and long-term goals can be achieved. Reject misinformation: In today’s digital age, misinformation spreads faster than ever, often leading to confusion, fear, and division. At this critical juncture, citizens must take responsibility for verifying the accuracy of information before sharing or acting upon it. This involves cross-checking facts, relying on credible news sources, and being cautious of sensationalist narratives on social media platforms. Education and awareness campaigns about media literacy can empower people to discern truth from falsehood. Rejecting misinformation not only protects individual understanding but also weakens the influence of those who seek to destabilise the government through propaganda. When citizens act as gatekeepers of truth, they contribute significantly to national stability. Uphold patriotism: True patriotism lies in prioritising the nation’s interests above personal or political biases. At this juncture, citizens must remain vigilant against foreign influences and conspiracies that aim to exploit internal divisions for their benefit. This involves identifying and opposing individuals or groups that collaborate with external powers to undermine the government or disrupt national unity. Patriotism also calls for active participation in initiatives that protect national sovereignty, such as supporting local industries, volunteering for community programs, and promoting positive narratives about Bangladesh domestically and internationally. A collective display of patriotism sends a powerful message of resilience to both internal detractors and external adversaries. Foster unity: National unity is the cornerstone of progress during a transitional period. Citizens must rise above political, religious, and ethnic differences to work toward shared national goals. This requires engaging in constructive dialogue, building bridges between communities, and fostering mutual respect. Unity can also be cultivated through grassroots initiatives that bring people together for common causes, such as community development projects, educational programs, and environmental conservation efforts. By focusing on shared aspirations rather than divisive issues, citizens can strengthen the social fabric and create a supportive environment for reform.  Conclusion BANGLADESH is undergoing a period of profound transformation, with immense potential to emerge as a stronger, more united nation. Under the visionary leadership of Muhammad Yunus, the interim government is working tirelessly to rebuild the country, restore democratic values, and uplift its people. However, success depends not only on the government’s efforts but also on the collective resolve of its citizens. Together, through unity, resilience, and a commitment to truth, Bangladesh can overcome its challenges and fulfil the aspirations of the July revolution, creating a brighter future for generations to come. The people hold the key to the nation’s future. By standing united, rejecting falsehoods, prioritising patriotism, and supporting the government’s efforts, they can help ensure a successful transition to a stable, prosperous, and democratic Bangladesh. In these challenging times, every citizen has a responsibility to contribute, not only as a beneficiary of progress but also as an active participant in shaping the country’s destiny. The collective strength, resolve, and determination of the people will be the driving force behind a brighter and more hopeful future for Bangladesh.

No more printing money,"In the short run, efforts could be made to integrate off-channel money into the formal economy, target black money and recover misappropriated funds to address the current liquidity problem in the conomy and the banking sector, writesMd Jafor Ullah IN SEPTEMBER, amidst a highly volatile economy after the overthrow of Awami League government, the newly appointed governor of the Bangladesh Bank announced a decisive policy: no new money would be printed to address the ongoing liquidity issues, particularly within the banking sector. The government largely attributed the rampant inflation to sudden money printing and the resulting increase by Tk 60,000 crore in the money supply under the previous administration. The bank emphasised its commitment to controlling inflation by refraining from printing additional currency. The announcement led to cautious optimism among the people, who hoped for economic stability. However, by November, in only two months, the government retracted its stance, giving a clarification that the retraction was only partial. Confronted with an acute liquidity crisis in banks and fearing that people might lose confidence in the banking system, the government resorted to the extraordinary measure of injecting liquidity. A total of Tk 22,500 crore was allocated to six banks in trouble to alleviate the crisis. The central issue remains whether this approach is prudent and serves the best interests of people, especially when particularly lower income groups are already strained by high inflation. While the current official inflation rate hovers around 11.35 per cent, many perceive it to be significantly higher in several instances. Authorities defended their decision, arguing that this liquidity injection was a necessary and a temporary measure to support the banking sector. They asserted that the money would be quickly withdrawn and would not impact the overall money supply or inflation. However, the debate continues over the wisdom of this policy shift and its potential implications for inflation and economic stability. According to the central bank’s report, as of September, the base money supply stood at Tk 311,014 crore, accounting for 6.16 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product. With the recent injection, this ratio has increased to 6.61 per cent. In comparison, major economies have relatively higher base money-to-gross domestic product ratios. In the Untied States, it is 18.97 per cent, in China 37.11 per cent, in India 20.75 per cent and in Japan 20.13 per cent. This context suggests that Bangladesh’s base money ratio remains comparatively low, providing a rationale for the decision to increase liquidity. However, to begin with, the money supply in an economy is directly correlated with inflation. Fundamental economic theory suggests that an increase in the money supply without a corresponding increase in goods and services typically exacerbates inflation. This applies to all forms of money supply, from base money to broad money. The recent infusion of money into the banking system, intended to be distributed to depositors, could augment the base money supply. As the funds potentially convert into hard currency, this increase in the monetary base is expected to contribute to inflationary trends. Moreover, the new money supply will increase the base money by approximately 7.23 per cent, raising Bangladesh’s base money to 16.29 per cent of the intermediate money supply. Compared with major economies that actively combat inflation, the figures are relatively high. For instance, the base money-to-intermediate money ratios in the United Kingdom, China, Japan, and Canada are 3.19 per cent, 3.96 per cent, 8.99 per cent and 6.55 per cent. This indicates that Bangladesh will have a higher proportion of hard currency in circulation. Given that a significant portion of Bangladesh’s population engages in economic activities outside formal banking channels, this influx of hard currency is expected to intensify inflationary pressures. Furthermore, to manage inflation, the government of Bangladesh primarily relies on monetary policy. Historically, fiscal policy has been characterised by deficit budgets and a narrow tax base. Consequently, without complementary fiscal measures, any increase in the money supply, from base money to broad money, is likely to result in inflation. Economic theory suggests that effective inflation control requires a balanced approach that integrates both monetary and fiscal policies. Without adjustments in fiscal policy such as increasing tax revenues and reducing budget deficits, relying solely on monetary measures can lead to inflationary pressure, especially when the money supply expands without a corresponding increase in goods and services. To conclude, the new money supply will inevitably exacerbate inflation to a greater or lesser extent, a reality well understood by policymakers. Given the fragile state of the banking industry, it is understandable why the government has resorted to this measure despite being fully aware of its consequences. Nevertheless, it is crucial that they refrain from taking such action in the future, regardless of the economic challenges faced. The country’s people, particularly the poor, cannot withstand a further inflation. Moreover, failures to manage inflation effectively will have far-reaching consequences, extending beyond the economic sphere. Therefore, controlling inflation should be the top priority for this interim government. Under no circumstances should additional money be printed. To address the current liquidity problem in the economy and the banking sector, it might be beneficial for the government to focus on several key measures. In the short run, efforts could be made to integrate off-channel money into the formal economy, target black money and recover misappropriated funds. In the- medium to long- runs, expanding the tax base, implementing prudent fiscal policies and ensuring stringent budgetary discipline could prove helpful.

India’s turn to shore up damage,"THERE is no hide and seek that India has huge discomfort and embarrassment about the political changeover in Bangladesh that took place on August 5. Developing events suggests that India considers the changeover as its ‘political defeat in Bangladesh’ and unleashing vengeful plots in hegemonic arrogance to destabilise the country to put back the government of its choice in power. Besides employing political and non-political moles and agents to create social chaos, the play was the posting of the minority card. Playing the minority card was started by the Indian prime minister in a message on his X handle urging the chief adviser to Bangladesh’s interim government on August 8 to ensure the safety and protection of the Hindus and all other minorities in Bangladesh. Since then, India’s ministry of external affairs and both traditional and non-traditional media embarked on allout disinformation campaign against Bangladesh. To add impetus to the disinformation campaign, India thought that the minority card could be an effective tool. So, India brought to the fore the Bangladesh Hindu, Christian and Buddhist Unity Council with sit-ins and processions in Dhaka. But the organisation’s movement did not get momentum, understandably because of the opposition from the Christians and the Buddhists. The Christians and the Buddhist, perhaps, did not want to become India’s puppet in the disinformation propaganda and undermine their reputation in the country. Then the International Society for Krishna Conscience, or ISKCON, was brought in to replace the Bangladesh Hindu, Christian and Buddhist Unity Council. Chinmoy Krishna Das, head of Sri Sri Pundarik Dham in Chattogram, took the leadership to divide society along the Hindu-Muslim line. He did not belong to ISKCON but held rallies in Chattogram and Rangpur under the ISKCON banner. Chinmay Das was expelled  from ISKCON Bangladesh in July 2024 for sexually abusing children in the temple. Charu Chandra Das Brahmachari, the secretary general of ISKCON Bangladesh and the director, said in a press conference on November 28 that Chinmay Das did not belong to ISKCON Bangladesh as he was expelled. The organisation declined to shoulder any responsibility ‘over his statements and speech.’ But the Indian ministry of external affairs and the media across India branded him as the leader of ISKCON in Bangladesh. Chinmay Das was arrested on November 25 on sedition charges, a case filed by a Bangladeshi citizen. Irked by the legal proceedings against Chinmay Das, India’s external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, referring to the case against Chinmoy Das, on November 29 said, ‘Our position on the matter is very clear. The interim government must live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities.’ The statement carried the message that legal proceeding cannot be initiated under the law of the land against any one belonging to the Hindu community in the event of the commission of a crime. Chinmoy was produced in a court in Chattogram on November 27. The court denied him bail and sent him to jail. On the refusal of bail, his followers ransacked the court premises and its surroundings. Saiful Islam Alif, an assistant public prosecutor, was killed. The killing of the lawyer made the situation extremely delicate. Yet, the Indian media went on saying that ‘Islamists’ killed Saiful Islam Alif as he was the lawyer of Chinmay Das and defended him in court which was a blatant lie. The Indian media have the notoriety of carrying misinformation and disinformation globally. The Global Economic Forum conducted a survey in 2023 in 34 countries where the Indian media ranked in the first position for its infamy in propagating fake news. Realising the sensitivity of the situation ISKCON Bangladesh cleared Chinmoy’s position in the organisation at the press conference. ISKCON’s clarification on Chinmay came too late and at the cost of a life. ISKCON should have made clear Chinmoy’s position in ISKCON at the outset while he was manoeuvring to create public nuisance using ISKCON’s banner. After the court had denied bail and ISKCON Bangladesh had made public Chinmoy’s position in the organisation, Indian media made him a leader of Hindu Mahajagaran Mancha overnight. India’s external affairs ministry issued a press note, expressing concern about the denial of bail to Chinmay. Such undiplomatic overture was deliberate interference into Bangladesh’s judicial system. Since the denial of the bail to Chinmay, the Indian political circle and the media became more aggressive. Three months’ disinformation campaign impacted the Indian political leadership, especially in the bordering Indian states. It successfully turned sections of Indian population against Bangladesh. Bhartiya Janata Party activists staged violent demonstrations in front of Bangladesh deputy high commission in Kolkata on November 29. Three days later on December 2, 2024, BJP activists barged into the assistant high commission in Agartala. Activist started to assail Bangladeshis visiting India. Bangladeshis were thrown out of hotels and their belongings were snatched away. Hotels declared a boycott of Bangladeshi visitors. A couple of hospitals in Kolkata announced that they would not treat Bangladeshi patients. Twenty-one hospitals in Kolkata cancelled Bangladeshi patients’ schedule. Both the Indian government and the Indian media were successful in creating acrimonious situation against Bangladeshis. All this will have damaging impact on relation between the two countries than the temporary leverage in local politics that the politicians expected to gain. Bangladesh’s interim government has since the changeover been very positive about pursuing harmonious relation with India. Bangladesh’s foreign ministry offered a dialogue between the chief adviser to the interim government and the Indian prime minister on the sidelines of the 79th session of the UN General Assembly on September 10. India rejected the offer as an expression of displeasure about the political change. There is no denying that the relation between India and Bangladesh has hit the lowest in 50 years. Despite all negative narratives from India, Bangladesh has maintained a positive attitude towards an improved relation. The chief adviser was quoted as saying on December 5 that, ‘Relations between the two countries must be very close. This is essential from any angle, whether it’s about economics, security or water. Just as we need them in our interest, they need us in their interest. So, we have to forget certain transient matters… The main thing is to maintain good relations. We have to use everything in our power to advance towards that.’ The Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Kumar Verma speaking at a conference in October said that relations between the two countries are ‘multifaceted’ amid ‘sustained and positive momentum’ in trade and economic ties and ‘people-to-people engagements.’ To confirm this commitment in the context of political changeover in Bangladesh, India needs to show in deeds that it has made a policy shift to work with the interim government and value the people and its government and that its land is not used for creating instability and violence within Bangladesh. The ball is in India’s court. Let us see how does India play the ball to shore up the damage it has done in the bilateral relations.
