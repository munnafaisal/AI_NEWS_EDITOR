Pakistan nat’l airline to resume flights to Europe after ban lifted,"Pakistan’s beleaguered national airline will resume flights to Europe on January 10 after European Union authorities lifted a four-year ban on the carrier, the company said in a statement on Saturday. The statement from Pakistan International Airline (PIA), which was at the centre of a pilot license scandal, said a ‘PIA flight will depart from Islamabad to Paris on January 10’. ‘Initially, two flights will be operated weekly (on Friday and Sunday), which will gradually be increased.’ PIA was barred from flying to the EU in June 2020, a month after one of its aircraft plunged into a street in the southern city of Karachi, killing nearly 100 people. The disaster was attributed to human error by the pilots and air traffic control, and was followed by allegations that nearly a third of the licences for its pilots were fake or dubious. The airline remains banned from operating in the United States. After Europe’s ban was lifted last week, a spokesman for the carrier said they would ‘strictly adhere to EASA’s regulations and guidelines’, referring to the European Union’s aviation authority. PIA, which employs 7,000 people, has long been accused of being bloated and poorly run -- hobbled by unpaid bills, a poor safety record and regulatory issues. Pakistan’s government has said it is committed to privatising the debt-ridden airline and has been scrambling to find a buyer. Last month, a deal fell through after a potential buyer reportedly offered a fraction of the asking price. The sale was also part of IMF demands in exchange for aid programmes, including the privatisation of public companies, establishing a broader tax base and ending subsidies for the 40 percent of Pakistanis who live below the poverty line.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/252245/pakistan-natl-airline-to-resume-flights-to-europe-after-ban-lifted
Nobel laureates urge strong AI regulation,"Physics Nobel Prize winner Geoffrey Hinton and chemistry laureate Demis Hassabis on Saturday insisted on a need for strong regulation of artificial intelligence, which played a key role in their awards. ‘AI is a very important technology to regulate but I think it’s very important that we get the regulations right and I think that’s the hard thing at the moment is it’s such a fast moving technology,’ Hassabis told a news conference in Stockholm. Hassabis, who jointly won with Americans David Baker and John Jumper for revealing the secrets of proteins through AI, said such evolutionary speed posed a giant challenge. But the underlying issue, he said, is ‘about what do we want to use these systems for, how do we want to deploy them and making sure that all of humanity benefits from what these systems can do.’ British-Canadian Hinton, considered the ‘Godfather of AI,’ conceded that ‘I wish I’d thought about safety earlier,’ in allusion to his fears about the potential for AI to ramp up the arms race. Hinton, who made headlines when he quit Google last year and warned of the dangers machines could one day outsmart people, was awarded his Nobel along with American John Hopfield for work on artificial neural networks. ‘Governments are unwilling to regulate themselves when it comes to lethal autonomous weapons and there is an arms race going on between all the major arms suppliers like the United States, China, Russia, Britain, Israel. Hassabis said he was recommending governments come up with ‘fast and nimble regulations.’ He said he had been advising governments and civil society to build on regulations in domains such as healthcare and transport ‘and see how the technology develops and then quickly adapt to the way that’s going.’ He told AFP he had had discussions with Elon Musk about the ‘existential threat’ posed by inappropriate use of AI and indicated the tech billionaire was concerned at the potential for AI to wrest control from humans. He added that he was confident Musk would ‘communicate that to Trump and his administration’ when Donald Trump returns to the White House in January. But he warned that he was not sure if all of Trump’s team would necessarily be sufficiently attuned to the risks entailed, adding that he believed Musk himself is not a ‘particularly moral’ person.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/telecom/252244/nobel-laureates-urge-strong-ai-regulation
"Businesses seek stable law, order","Business leaders on Saturday called on the government to take immediate actions to ensure a stable law-and-order situation in industrial areas, and secure the safety of factories, particularly in the garment sector. A meeting held at the BGMEA Complex at Uttara in the capital Dhaka, leaders of the country’s key industry associations said that a secure environment was vital for safeguarding jobs and fostering economic development. Escalating safety risks in industrial areas are a key concern, business leaders said citing a recent attack on a deputy managing director of Mahmud Denim Limited. They warned that ongoing security issues could discourage investment and entrepreneurship, undermining Bangladesh’s business climate and harming the national economy. Business leaders emphasised the importance of maintaining a secure environment to protect employment and drive economic growth. Industry leaders urged the government to act swiftly to enhance safety conditions, especially in the garment sector, to ensure the stability of Bangladesh’s industrial landscape. Another major concern discussed at the meeting was the ongoing gas supply shortage. Business leaders expressed frustration over banking challenges, particularly issues with access to financing and liquidity, saying that the issues were hindering business operations. The leaders also expressed concerns about a new Bangladesh Bank policy on defaulted loans, saying that it could disrupt private sector investment and employment. Businesses expressed concerns over Bangladesh’s upcoming graduation from least developed country status in 2026, warning that losing trade benefits could harm the country’s global competitiveness. They also recommended a 3-6-year extension for the country’s graduation from least developed status to better prepare for the challenges ahead. The meeting, chaired by the administrator of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association Md Anwar Hossain, was attended by Square Pharmaceuticals managing director Tapan Chowdhury, FBCCI administrator Md Hafizur Rahman, Bangladesh Employers Federation president Ardashir Kabir, Bangladesh Chamber of Industries president Anwar Ul Alam Chowdhury Parvez, Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Mohammad Hatem, Bangladesh Textile Mills Association president Showkat Aziz Russell, and MCCI president Kamran T Rahman, among others.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/trade-commerce/252243/businesses-seek-stable-law-order
Investment promotion ecosystem struggles,"The fragmented structure of investment promotion ecosystem in Bangladesh and poor coordination among investment promotion agencies, regulatory bodies and service providers, outdated laws, weak enforcement of intellectual property rights and a number of other issues were major barriers to attracting investments in Bangladesh. The observation was made in the white paper on the state of Bangladesh economy submitted to chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on December 1. Although the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority was established as the central agency to support investments, its effectiveness was hampered due to insufficient collaboration with other IPAs, regulatory institutions and service providers, the paper said. BIDA’s regional offices also faced infrastructural challenges that hindered the full implementation of its one stop service platform, aimed at streamlining investment procedures. Policy inconsistencies and procedural delays further deterred foreign investments. For instance, the paper said, discrepancies between BIDA’s work permit guidelines and the residency definition under the Income Tax Act 2023 created confusion among investors. Additionally, the work permit approval process could take up to 12 months, frustrating investors. The report recommended integrating visa and work permit procedures, similar to practices in India and Thailand, to improve efficiency. The paper noted that automation efforts in Bangladesh were also incomplete. Initiatives like the VAT online and income tax automation projects still require dual submissions for approvals and registrations, undermining their effectiveness. ‘Furthermore, the monitoring and evaluation system remains weak, as BIDA depends on estimated data from its investor relationship management system, which is not systematically utilised,’ it said. The legislative framework also complicated the investment landscape. Outdated laws such as the Foreign Private Investment Promotion and Protection Act 1989 and the Transfer of Property Act 1882 posed challenges, while the Bangladesh Flag Vessels (Protection) Act 2019 created logistical bottlenecks by mandating 50 per cent of goods be transported via Bangladeshi vessels, despite the limited capacity of national shipping lines. In the pharmaceutical sector, reliance on imported active pharmaceutical ingredients and new regulatory requirements under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 2023 created operational hurdles. Weak enforcement of intellectual property rights further exposed investors to risks. The report urged the government to strengthen IPR protection and train enforcement agencies like customs and police to improve investor confidence. The absence of a centralised master OSS, originally intended to integrate services from agencies such as the Bangladesh Export Processing Zone, the Bangladesh Economic Zone Authority and the Hi-Tech Park Authority, has led to data inaccuracies and coordination issues. Moreover, duplications in registration processes across multiple agencies could be resolved by introducing a unique investor identification system, the paper suggested. The report also pointed out that BIDA’s registration system included numerous small-scale projects with investments below Tk 15 crore, raising questions about their necessity for BIDA registration when a trade licence could suffice. It called for streamlining processes and reducing the excessive number of regulatory approvals required, which currently stands at 150 across 23 government agencies.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/252242/investment-promotion-ecosystem-struggles
"Capital flights, corruption make ensuring equality challenging","Planning and education adviser Wahiduddin Mahmud on Saturday said that building an equitable society in the current reality was challenging, given that huge capital flights, corruption and massive irregularities had constrained investments in education, health, human resource development and other areas. He made the comment at the inaugural session of the Annual BIDS Conference on Development (ABCD) 2024, organised by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies at the Hotel Lakeshore at Gulshan in the capital Dhaka. Wahiduddin, also an economist, inaugurated the four-day development conference titled ‘Equality, Opportunity, Freedom, and Dignity for Equitable and Sustainable Development’. BIDS director general Binayak Sen delivered the opening remarks during the inaugural session. Discussing how Bangladesh could build an equitable society following the student-led mass uprising, Wahiduddin highlighted the severe resource constraints faced by the interim government. He pointed out that significant amounts of money were siphoned off abroad, while domestic funds remained in banks but were inaccessible. Regarding the projects initiated during the previous government’s tenure, he pointed out that several projects were prestige-driven, undertaken primarily for publicity rather than necessity. The interim government is now re-evaluating their purposes and outcomes, he said. ‘We are still trapped in the lower middle-income bracket, far from achieving what the Philippines has, let alone Malaysia,’ the adviser observed. He mentioned that Vietnam’s per capita income in the 1990s was similar to Bangladesh’s. ‘Now Vietnam’s per capita income is 40-50 times of Bangladesh. They secure $20 billion annually in foreign direct investment, while we attract just $2 billion,’ he said. ‘We lack substantial global economic integration and need significant advancements in education and technology,’ he added. Regarding Bangladesh’s LDC graduation, he highlighted the country’s qualification twice for the graduation. Seeking an extension to remain an LDC is seen as regressive, he said. ‘Once qualified, a nation must graduate. We need active global engagement to navigate this shift,’ he added. Wahiduddin Mahmud also expressed hope that Bangladesh would see an elected government in 2025. ‘No country can become rich overnight. It requires collective efforts and a sustained strategy. Our interim government is here for a short term,’ Wahiduddin said. The interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was formed on August 8 following the fall of the authoritarian regime of Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India amid a student-led mass uprising on August 5. Indermit S Gill, the chief economist of the World Bank Group, said, ‘To escape being trapped in slower growth, middle-income countries need to balance the economic forces of creation, preservation and destruction.’ Middle-income countries which are home to six billion people, are in a race against time, he said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/252241/capital-flights-corruption-make-ensuring-equality-challenging
RMG exports to US surge in Oct,"Bangladesh’s readymade garment exports to the United States in October 2024 recorded the highest growth marking a 25-per cent increase in quantity and a 26-per cent rise in value compared with those in the same month of 2023. The US’ apparel imports from Bangladesh in October 2024 surged to 227.5 million square metres worth $731 million compared with those of 181.8 million square metres worth $578 million in October 2023, according to the data released by the Office of Textiles and Apparel under the US Department of Commerce. Bangladesh’s apparel exports to the US in September 2024 also recorded substantial growth of 19 per cent to 216.2 million square metres compared with those of 181.7 million square metres shipped in September 2023. Similarly, the export value in September 2024 climbed to $705.20 million, marking a 19-per cent increase from the $594.44 million achieved during the corresponding month of 2023. Meanwhile, Bangladesh’s RMG exports to the US in January-October period of 2024 decreased by 3.31 per cent compared with those in the same period of 2023. This was a sharper decline compared to the overall world import drop of 0.43 per cent, indicating that Bangladesh’s performance was below the global trend. Other competitor countries, such as Vietnam, India, and Cambodia, experienced positive growth in apparel exports to the US during the period. Bangladesh’s apparel exports to the US in the first 10 months of 20-24 declined to $6.15 billion compared with those of $6.36 billion in the same period of 2023. In terms of volume, Bangladesh exported 1.96 billion square metres of apparel from January to October period of 2024 with 1.6 per cent growth. The OTEXA data showed that Bangladesh retained a substantial share of 9.12 per cent, positioning it as the third-largest apparel exporter to the US after China 20.83 per cent and Vietnam 18.88 per cent. The US’ apparel imports from Vietnam grew by 3.87 per cent to $ 12.70 billion in January-October of 2024, while the imports from China declined by 1.41 per cent to $14.03 billion. The OTEXA data showed that the US’ apparel imports from Cambodia grew by 12.86 per cent to $3.22 billion in the first 10 months of 2024 compared with those of $2.86 billion in the same period in 2023. India’s RMG exports to the US market increased by 2.68 per cent to $4.05 billion, while those of Pakistan grew by 4.44 per cent to $1.80 billion in the same period.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/apparel/252240/rmg-exports-to-us-surge-in-oct
Romania police raid houses after vote scrapped,"Romanian police raided houses on Saturday, a day after the top court cancelled the presidential vote in an unprecedented development following allegations of Russian interference in favour of the far-right frontrunner. The court’s shock move, just before the presidential run-off, opens the way for a new electoral process to start from scratch in the EU and NATO member state bordering war-torn Ukraine. A new government—to be formed after last weekend’s legislative elections that were won by the ruling Social Democrats but saw big far-right gains—will set a new presidential election date. The annulment comes after a spate of intelligence documents declassified this week by the presidency detailed allegations against far-right presidential frontrunner Calin Georgescu and Russia, including ‘massive’ social media promotion and cyberattacks. Police searched three houses in Brasov city in central Romania on Saturday as part of the investigation ‘in connection with crimes of voter corruption, money laundering, computer forgery,’ said a statement from the prosecutor’s office. It said the swoop targeted a person involved in the ‘illegal financing of the electoral campaign of a candidate for the presidency of Romania, through the use of sums of money,’ without naming Georgescu. The prosecutor’s office would not name the person at the heart of the operation either. The investigations also concern the violation of the law on the prohibition of organisations and symbols of a fascist, racist or xenophobic nature, the statement added. Little-known outsider Georgescu, who unexpectedly topped the first round of voting on November 24, was favourite to win the second round on Sunday against centrist pro-EU mayor Elena Lasconi, according to several polls. But the documents drawn up for a top security council meeting after the first round of voting ‘revealed an aggressive promotional campaign, in violation of electoral legislation, and an exploitation of algorithms to increase the popularity of Calin Georgescu at an accelerated pace’. One TikTok user paid $381,000 to those involved in the promotion of Georgescu between October 24 and November 24, according to one of the documents. The document identified that user as businessman Bogdan Peschir, who has compared his support for Georgescu to the world’s richest man Elon Musk’s backing of US president-elect Donald Trump. Another declassified document said Romania was a ‘target for aggressive Russian hybrid actions’, including cyberattacks. More than 85,000 cyberattacks—including ‘on election day’—were identified, according to Romanian authorities. Based on those claims, the constitutional court on Friday unanimously decided to annul the entire electoral process, saying it had been ‘marred... by multiple irregularities and violations of electoral legislation’. The United States said it had faith in Romania’s institutions and called for a ‘peaceful democratic process’. Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., on X branded the cancelation of the vote as an ‘attempt at rigging the outcome’ and ‘denying the will of the people’. Georgescu, a 62-year-old former civil servant, called it ‘a formalised coup d’etat’ and said democracy was ‘under attack’. His team on Saturday declined to comment on the raids, saying they ‘will not comment or provide answers until we have exact data’. A past admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the EU and NATO sceptic in recent days has reframed himself as ‘ultra pro-Trump,’ vowing to put Romania ‘on the world map’ and cut aid for neighbouring Ukraine. Romania’s pro-EU President Klaus Iohannis said Friday that he would stay in his post until a new government can be formed to set a fresh presidential election date. In last weekend’s parliamentary elections, the governing pro-European Social Democrats won the legislative vote, but far-right parties secured a third of the ballots. Since the 1989 fall of Communism, Romania has not seen such a breakthrough by the far-right banking on mounting anger over soaring inflation and Russia’s war in Ukraine. In a joint appeal on Wednesday, the Social Democrats and three other pro-EU parties—together making up an absolute majority in parliament—signed an agreement to form a coalition, promising ‘stability’.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252239/romania-police-raid-houses-after-vote-scrapped
Dozens held in Georgia pro-EU protest,"Georgian police said on Saturday they arrested dozens of people during a crackdown on pro-EU protesters who rallied Friday for a ninth consecutive day against the government decision to shelve talks on joining the bloc. Security forces fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse the thousands of people who had gathered outside parliament in Tbilisi in the evening to demand fresh elections and a return to European integration. ‘Law enforcement detained 48 individuals for disobedience to lawful police orders and petty hooliganism,’ the interior ministry said in a statement. The Caucasus nation has been engulfed in turmoil since the governing Georgian Dream party declared that it had won a disputed October 26 election. The government which critics accuse of creeping authoritarianism and of steering the country back towards Russia, last week said it would suspend talks to join the European Union, sparking a fresh wave of demonstrations. Authorities’ heavy-handed response has triggered outrage at home and mounting international condemnation. Hundreds of arrests have been made. The country’s rights ombudsman has accused the police of ‘torture’ against those detained, with scores reporting mistreatment or showing visible injuries. Friday night’s demonstration had been largely peaceful until riot police moved in to clear the area, AFP reporters saw. Scuffles ensued with police making arrests and protesters launching fireworks at security forces. The interior ministry said authorities dispersed the crowd after the ‘actions of some of the people at the protest took on a violent character,’ with some verbally abusing police officers and throwing stones at them. One policeman was injured by a firework, it added. Rights ombudsman Levan Ioseliani said police ‘had no legal grounds for the dispersal of a peaceful rally.’ After the crackdown, smaller groups of demonstrators marched through the streets of the capital and blocked traffic on a central road, with police chasing after them and snatching some protesters. ‘As long as it takes’ - As on several previous nights, the protest ended at dawn and is expected to resume on Saturday. With both sides ruling out a compromise, there appeared to be no clear route out of the crisis. The United States, France and Germany are among the Western countries to have denounced the crackdown on protests. But the government has refused to back down. Before Friday’s rally, the prime minister had praised his security forces for ‘successfully neutralising the protesters’ capacity for violence’, after several opposition party offices were raided and opposition leaders arrested. ‘We have won an important battle against liberal fascism in our country,’ Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze told a news conference, using language reminiscent of how the Kremlin in Russia targets its political opponents. Yet, demonstrators remained defiant and rejected Kobakhidze’s characterisation of the protest movement. ‘The vast majority of people here are not affiliated with any parties,’ said Alexander Kavtaradze, 35, an academic who attended Friday’s rally in Tbilisi. ‘We’re here because we believe in the European democratic future of this country.’ Thousands have also staged anti-government rallies in the second city of Batumi on the Black Sea coast. ‘People are ready to fight for as long as it takes,’ said Adi, 37, a winemaker, protesting in the capital. Critics of Georgian Dream are enraged by what they call its betrayal of Tbilisi’s bid for EU membership, enshrined in the constitution and supported by around 80 percent of the population. Several ambassadors, a deputy foreign minister and other officials have resigned over the suspension of EU talks. Georgian Dream, in power for more than a decade, has advanced controversial legislation in recent years, targeting civil society and independent media and curbing LGBTQ rights. Brussels warned such policies were incompatible with EU membership, while domestic critics accuse the government of copying Russia’s playbook.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252238/dozens-held-in-georgia-pro-eu-protest
Storm Darragh batters UK,"Tens of thousands of people across the UK were left without power on Saturday morning after Storm Darragh hit the country with strong winds and caused pre-Christmas travel disruption. The UK’s Met Office had issued a rare red alert for high winds overnight to Saturday morning (0300 to 1100 GMT) covering parts of Wales and southwest England. The government warned three million people living in the area with a siren-like alert on their phones to stay at home on Friday night. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the storm posed a ‘challenging situation’. ‘About three million homes will have had the emergency alert system to their mobile phone. I would just encourage anyone who has had that to follow the advice,’ Reynolds told Sky News on Saturday. Darragh, the fourth named storm of the season, is also expected to bring heavy rain through the weekend, with more than 100 flood warnings and alerts in place across the UK. In Wales, the Met Office estimated gusts of up to 150 kmph (93 mph), which knocked out power for over 50,000 people, according to the PA news agency. Power cuts affected 86,000 homes in England, Scotland and Wales, according to the Energy Networks Association. Network Rail Wales suspended trains on the Welsh northern coast due to a ‘fallen tree blocking the line’, and several bridges in southern England and Wales were closed for safety reasons. A separate amber warning, which is less serious than the red alert but still poses ‘potential risk to life and property’, covering a larger stretch of the UK and Northern Ireland is in place until Saturday night. In Northern Ireland, thousands were left without power, and several bus and train services were suspended or delayed. Christmas markets and sporting events were postponed, including the Merseyside derby between Premier League leaders Liverpool and Everton. In Ireland, which issued an ‘orange’ wind warning, 400,000 people were left without electricity, according to the RTE news agency. Dublin Airport said a ‘a number of flights scheduled for Saturday morning have been cancelled by airlines’ due to the storm. Darragh comes two weeks after Storm Bert battered much of Britain, causing ‘devastating’ flooding in parts of Wales and knocking out power to thousands of homes in Ireland.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252237/storm-darragh-batters-uk
Zelensky slams Putin after Russian strikes kill 12,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday slammed Russia and its President Vladimir Putin over two aerial attacks that killed at least 12 people. Moscow has ramped up its strikes on Ukraine as winter sets in, and Zelensky said the attacks showed Russia has no interest in a deal to end its nearly three-year invasion. At least 10 people were killed in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, while two were killed in Zelensky’s hometown of Kryvyi Rig, officials said. ‘Thousands of such strikes carried out by Russia during this war make it absolutely clear that Putin does not need real peace,’ Zelensky said in a post on Telegram. ‘Only by force can we resist this. And only through force can real peace be established,’ he added. Zaporizhzhia governor Ivan Fedorov said a Russian attack had set a car garage and service station on fire in the blast, posting images of a fire blazing with debris strewn across the street. A total of 24 people were wounded there, including a four-month-old girl and at least two other children aged four and eleven, he said. In an update increasing the toll from the strike to 10, Ukraine’s national emergency services said on Telegram that the petrol station blaze was extinguished along with six cars on fire. Another 17 were wounded in the strike on Kryvyi Rig in the centre of Ukraine, Zelensky said. A six-year-old-boy was among the injured, Kryvyi Rig military administration head Oleksandr Vilkul said on Telegram. ‘A three-storey building was destroyed, residential buildings and cars were damaged’ in that attack, the agency said on Telegram. The latest strikes come after weeks of sharp escalation in the conflict, with Moscow stepping up its attacks on Kyiv’s energy infrastructure at the start of the harsh Ukrainian winter. And with Donald Trump’s return to the White House looming, the support of Kyiv’s key ally the United States has been thrown into question. Meanwhile Ukraine’s outgunned and outmanned forces have buckled across the eastern front in the face of a grinding pre-winter offensive from Russia. Moscow said Friday its forces had captured a village near the embattled supply hub of Pokrovsk and another near the industrial town of Kurakhove, gaining further ground in two key areas of the east Ukraine frontline. Analysts expect the next few months to be crucial as both sides jostle for battlefield momentum ahead of what are expected to be peace negotiations imposed by Trump. Zelensky is set to travel to Paris this weekend for the reopening of the Notre Dame cathedral, where he hopes to meet with the US president-elect, a senior Ukraine official told AFP. Trump, a sceptic of US aid to Kyiv, has said he could end the war within 24 hours of coming to office, but has yet to say how he intends to do so. Zelensky has repeatedly said Ukraine would not be able to hold off Russia’s advancing troops without US support, and there are fears in Kyiv that Trump could try to force them to accept peace terms favourable to Russia. Fears in Ukraine that the Republican would press Kyiv to accept major territorial concessions increased after Trump named Keith Kellogg, a retired general and critic of US military aid, as his Ukraine envoy last month. President Joe Biden’s outgoing administration announced an additional $725-million military package for the country on Monday.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252236/zelensky-slams-putin-after-russian-strikes-kill-12
Trump in Paris for reopening of Notre Dame,"US president-elect Donald Trump on Saturday arrived in Paris to join other world leaders for the reopening of the French capital’s Notre Dame cathedral, celebrating the restoration to its former glory half a decade after the devastating fire. Held up as an example of French creativity and resilience by President Emmanuel Macron, Notre Dame’s renaissance so soon after a 2019 blaze that destroyed its roof and spire comes at a difficult time for the country. Macron scored a major coup by attracting Trump, on his first foreign trip since his election, for the re-opening which will officially take place when archbishop of Paris Laurent Ulrich opens the doors to the cathedral at 1800 GMT for an almost two-hour ceremony. The president-elect is to hold talks with Macron and may also meet Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, one of scores of other world leaders descending on Paris for the day. But the sense of national accomplishment in restoring a beloved symbol of Paris has been undercut by political turmoil that has left France without a proper government and in a budget crisis. Macron is hoping that the first full service inside Notre Dame and the sight of around 40 world leaders in Paris might provide a fleeting sense of pride and unity—as the Paris Olympics did in July and August. The re-opening ‘is the proof that we know how to do grand things, we know how to do the impossible and the whole world has admired us for it on two occasions this year,’ Macron said during a televised address on Thursday, referring to the widely praised Olympics. During a visit with TV cameras last week. however, he somewhat undermined the suspense behind the reopening, revealing the cathedral’s freshly scrubbed limestone walls, new furniture and vaulted wooden roof cut from ancient oak trees selected from the finest forests of France. In one last-minute hitch, harsh weather forced officials to move Macron’s planned speech indoors and pre-record a concert Friday night, with forecasts for winds of up to 80 kilometres (50 miles) per hour as Storm Darragh put parts of France on red alert. The reconstruction effort has cost around 700 million euros ($750 million), financed from donations, with the re-opening achieved within five years despite predictions it could take decades. ‘This state-of-the-art restoration, the fruit of a worldwide collective effort and the use of many traditional French skills, has enabled this masterpiece to regain all its splendour,’ said Audrey Azoulay, the head of the UN cultural agency UNESCO, describing the work as ‘dazzling’. Trump accepted an invitation from Macron to attend earlier this week, saying the French leader had done ‘a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so.’ Travelling on a private plane, he landed at Orly airport in the south of Paris Saturday morning. US President Joe Biden will be represented by his wife Jill, while Britain’s Prince William will also be present and will hold talks with Trump and Jill Biden, his office said. Zelensky is expected to seek his first face-to-face meeting with Trump, who has vowed to force a peace agreement to end the war in Ukraine, possibly by withholding US weapon supplies. One surprising absentee will be Pope Francis, the head of the Catholic Church, who is instead visiting the French island of Corsica next weekend. A message from Francis addressed to the French people will be read out to the congregation.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252235/trump-in-paris-for-reopening-of-notre-dame

Saudi slams genocidal Israel,"A senior Saudi royal termed Israel ‘genocidal’ and an ‘apartheid’ state on Saturday, as he called on incoming US President-elect Donald Trump to bring peace to the Middle East. Prince Turki Al Faisal, who was Saudi Arabia’s intelligence chief for more than two decades, also said he hoped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would be brought before the International Criminal Court. ‘Israel today, according to international human rights groups, is not only an apartheid colonial state, but it is also a genocidal one,’ Prince Turki said. ‘It is committing genocide on the people of Gaza.’ He added: ‘It’s about time for the world to... take the necessary steps to bring those who are charged by the International Criminal Court to justice.’ The ICC issued warrants for Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant last month on suspicion of crimes against humanity and war crimes. Saudi’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also accused Israel of genocide at a joint Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit in Riyadh last month. Amnesty International levelled the same charge this week in a new report that was dismissed by Israel as ‘fabricated’ and ‘based on lies’. The war in Gaza was sparked by Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,208 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. Israel’s retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 44,612 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to figures from the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable. Prince Turki, also a former Saudi ambassador to the US, said Trump’s ‘strong mandate’ from American voters ‘can enable him to provide the statesmanship that is highly needed in the world. ‘Friendly countries in the region are hoping that Mr. Trump pursues what he started before, to bring peace with capital letters to the Middle East,’ he said. ‘It is time for America, under your presidency, to change the course of this troubled region,’ he added.

"Iran, Russia, Turkey discuss Syria in Doha","The top diplomats from Iran, Turkey and Russia met in Qatar on Saturday for talks on Syria, where rebel forces have taken parts of the country in a lightning offensive. After the discussions in Doha with his Russian and Turkish counterparts, Sergei Lavrov and Hakan Fidan, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the parties agreed on the initiation of ‘political dialogue between the Syrian government and the legitimate opposition groups’. The three countries have been involved since 2017 in the so-called Astana format talks seeking a political settlement in Syria. However, the situation in the country has changed dramatically in recent days after rapid gains by Islamist-led rebel forces who oppose Iran-backed Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. On Saturday, a commander with the Islamist-led alliance that launched the new offensive said ‘our forces have begun the final phase of encircling the capital’, though the Syrian defence ministry said ‘there is no truth to news claiming’ the army had withdrawn from positions near Damascus. Ahead of the meeting, Araghchi said he had ‘very frank and direct’ talks with his Turkish counterpart and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who this week called on Assad to ‘reconcile with his people’, said Friday he ‘hoped the advance of the rebels would continue without incident’, identifying Damascus as their objective. Qatar, meanwhile, supported the rebels at the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, but is now calling for a negotiated end to the conflict. On November 27, a coalition of rebels led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) launched an offensive from its stronghold in Idlib, seizing dozens of localities and the strategic cities of Aleppo and Hama, among others. Araghchi said during a joint press conference with his Iraqi and Syrian counterparts in Baghdad on Friday that the offensive in Syria poses a ‘threat’ to the whole Middle East. ‘This threat will not be limited to Syria and will affect Syria’s neighbouring countries such as Iraq, Jordan, and Turkey,’ he added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252232/iran-russia-turkey-discuss-syria-in-doha

Crony capitalism created undemocratic attitude: Rehman Sobhan,"Centre for Policy Dialogue chairman professor Rehman Sobhan on Saturday said that over the last decade, crony capitalism had spread from the parliament to the district, upazila and even union levels, fostering an undemocratic attitude within the government. He made the remarks while delivering a lecture at the annual international research conference,  organised by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies. Delivering a lecture titled ‘Agenda for economic and social reform’ during the second session of the conference, chaired by BIDS director general Binayak Sen, professor Sobhan highlighted key structural issues in the country. ‘There is a structural problem in our country. For this reason, sustainable development will not be possible if institutional reforms are not carried out. Our export sector cannot be limited to clothing only,’ he said. He stressed the need for export diversification, saying, ‘When the market does not work in our construction industry and other industries, including the ceramic industry, the state has to intervene. But here the state itself is unable to play an effective role.’ Rehman Sobhan acknowledged improvements in certain social indicators, including sanitation facilities, maternal mortality, and child mortality. The economist, however, expressed concerns over the rise of crony capitalism, which he said has led to undemocratic tendencies in governance. Speaking about anti-discrimination, he shared a personal anecdote. ‘I have been talking about anti-discrimination all my life, but how much progress has been made is a big question because I was a member of the planning commission, when I was going to a function with the status of a state minister, my car’s starter stopped. Then I had to push the car. Now the members of the planning commission need AC in their cars. Even branded cars worth crores of taka are used.’ Professor Sobhan also pointed to regional inequalities, noting that areas like Rangpur suffered from significant disparities compared to Dhaka and Chattogram.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252229/crony-capitalism-created-undemocratic-attitude-rehman-sobhan

Messi named MLS Most Valuable Player after record-setting season,"Lionel Messi was named Major League Soccer's Most Valuable Player on Friday after leading Inter Miami to a record-breaking regular season campaign. The Argentine superstar was handed the accolade after his performances helped Miami to a record regular season points tally, earning the club its first ever Supporters Shield. The 37-year-old maestro finished the regular season with a league-leading 36 goal contributions after netting 20 goals and 16 assists. Messi's MVP award comes despite an injury-hit campaign in which he made only 19 appearances. Miami and Messi's season ultimately fizzled out, when the team suffered a shock first-round defeat in the MLS Cup playoffs. Messi is the 10th South American to win the MVP, and the fifth from Argentina after Luciano Acosta, Diego Valeri, Guillermo Barros Schelotto, and Christian Gomez. Messi was presented with the award in a ceremony at Inter's Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale alongside Miami Academy players. ‘Truly, it is an honor for me to receive this award from all of you,’ Messi told the Academy players in a video posted on the team's website. ‘It's a source of pride to watch you all train. I'm very happy to be here every day. ‘I'm happy to be in this city, in this club that is growing ... I invite you to keep fighting and striving for your dreams.’ MLS commissioner Don Garber said Messi brought an unprecedented touch of football stardom to the league, which will conclude its season on Saturday with the MLS Cup final between LA Galaxy and New York Red Bulls in Los Angeles. ‘To have the best player in the world be the best player in Major League Soccer is something that dreams are made of for all of us,’ Garber said.

Dominant England power 533 runs ahead of NZ after Atkinson hat-trick,"Gus Atkinson claimed a hat-trick before England's batsmen let loose to power the visitors 533 runs ahead of New Zealand on Saturday and in full control of the second Test. The flagging home side will need to chase an enormous score in the fourth innings after England went to stumps at 378-5 in Wellington on day two. Captain Ben Stokes resisted any urge to declare, instead cementing England's position of power as four batters posted half-centuries to build on their first-innings advantage of 155. Joe Root was at the crease on 73 while Stokes struck a whirlwind 35 not out against a tiring attack, after Jacob Bethell and Ben Duckett were both dismissed in the 90s. The fast-moving nature of the Test means the Black Caps should theoretically have ample time to reach any target, as they bid to square the three-match series after losing the opener in Christchurch by eight wickets. However, history is firmly against them. The highest successful fourth-innings chase at the Basin Reserve is 274, achieved by Pakistan against the hosts in 2003. New Zealand's hopes of getting back into the Test were scuppered in the opening 40 minutes of play when they lost their last five wickets to be all out for 125. Atkinson (4-31) removed the last three wickets with successive deliveries to become the first Englishman to claim a Test hat-trick since Moeen Ali against South Africa seven years ago. The 26-year-old seamer was all smiles after bowling Nathan Smith for 14, then having Matt Henry caught in the gully and trapping Tim Southee lbw. ‘It was great. As a bowler you think about getting five-fors and 10-fors and that sort of thing,’ Atkinson said. ‘To get a hat-trick, I wasn't thinking about it too much at all but there's not many chances to do it and I was feeling pretty good when I was running in for that third ball. ‘The plan this morning was to go hard at them. It worked out pretty well and the boys did really well with the bat, and we've got a pretty healthy lead.’ Atkinson said he wasn't aware of Stokes' possible declaration plan but said he would be ready to go when called upon. England made batting look comparatively easy, most notably when Bethell (96) and Duckett (92) combined for an untroubled 187-run second-wicket stand. Bethell fell agonisingly short of a maiden Test ton when edging Southee to wicketkeeper Tom Blundell. The 21-year-old looked crestfallen as he exited after a 118-ball knock which featured 10 fours and three sixes. Atkinson said he felt for the Test newcomer. ‘It's a shame, he batted so beautifully. It would have been nice for him to get his first hundred but he'll take a lot from that. He was outstanding.’ Opener Duckett was closing on his fifth Test ton when he played-on off Southee (2-72), ending an innings of 112 balls. First-Test centurion Harry Brook reached 55 before being caught in the deep off spinner Glenn Phillips while Root put some modest recent form behind him to post another batting milestone. Root became only the fourth player to reach 50 runs in 100 different Test innings. Ollie Pope fell for 10 off seamer Henry (2-76), who earlier dismissed Zak Crawley for eight, continuing a lean series for the opener. In 19 Test innings against the Black Caps, Crawley has scored just 193 runs at an average of 10.15. Henry said New Zealand needed to remain positive. ‘Obviously we'll have a wee reflection overnight and we've got a big job to do tomorrow,’ he said. ‘I think the boys will look forward to getting stuck in and getting into the fight. ‘There's still plenty of time in this game.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252223/dominant-england-power-533-runs-ahead-of-nz-after-atkinson-hat-trick

Australia zero in on victory over India after Head crunches 140,"Travis Head blazed a sparkling 140 before Australia demolished India's top order to close in on victory in the day-night second Test on Saturday. At stumps on day two the visitors were floundering at 128-5, still 29 runs adrift, after a fiery blast under the Adelaide Oval lights from Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Scott Boland. Rishabh Pant was on 28 and Nitish Kumar Reddy 15 as the hosts eye their eighth straight pink-ball victory in Adelaide to level the five-Test series after being crushed by 295 runs in Perth. Australia were all out just after tea for 337 after resuming on 86-1, with Head producing a typically flamboyant knock on his home ground in front of a big crowd. Batting at five, he scored at almost a run a ball, slamming 17 fours and four sixes, while Marnus Labuschagne chipped in a gritty 64 to build a first-innings lead of 157. In reply, India struggled as the sun went down with KL Rahul lasting just 10 balls before Cummins sent a short one to the ribs and he gloved to Alex Carey behind the stumps. Yashasvi Jaiswal, out for a golden duck in the first innings, made 24 this time, but he had no answer to Boland, whose first ball angled away and took a nick to Carey. Boland stunned superstar Virat Kohli (11) in similar fashion, with Carey holding his third of the night to leave India tottering at 66-3. Shubman Gill was next to go after a determined 28, with his middle stump removed by Starc, who thought he had Rohit Sharma out lbw two balls later. The wicket was given, but then ruled a no-ball and the Indian captain survived, but not for long with Cummins bowling him for six. When play started, India got an early breakthrough with Nathan McSweeney adding just one to his overnight 38 before being beaten by Jasprit Bumrah's sheer pace, nicking to wicketkeeper Pant. Bumrah and Pant then combined to remove Steve Smith (2) four overs later, with the former Australia skipper shaking his head in disbelief after falling into a similar trap. At the other end, Labuschagne kept his focus, rediscovering the magic that has recently eluded him with calls mounting for him to be dropped. But the tenacious number three, who resumed on 20, silenced the doubters by reaching his 21st Test 50 off a patient 114 balls in a big confidence booster. With the landmark behind him he began playing more freely before a brilliant catch from Jaiswal at gully ended his reign and Head took charge. Head adopted his usual aggressive posture, blasting two sixes off spinner Ravichandran Ashwin as he reached his half-century from 63 balls. He then ramped up the attack, racing to his second 50 off just 48 deliveries to clock an eighth Test ton, riding his luck along the way after being dropped on 76 by Mohammed Siraj. Mitchell Marsh briefly hung around before feathering to Pant on nine off Ashwin while Carey contributed 15 before he too got a faint edge to Pant, this time off Siraj. Head finally succumbed to the rampaging Siraj, clean-bowled, with the pair involved in a fiery exchange in the aftermath after the Indian quick gave the hometown hero a send-off. When Bumrah, who took 4-61, bowled Cummins the tail was quickly mopped up.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252221/australia-zero-in-on-victory-over-india-after-head-crunches-140

Rizvi accuses India of spreading lies about Bangladesh,"Bangladesh Nationalist Party senior leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi on Saturday accused India of trying to mislead the world by spreading lies about Bangladesh in its attempt to support the ousted Awami League government. ‘Politicians, policymakers and many media figures in neighbouring countries-particularly those who compromise their integrity-are crying over the escape of the despotic ruler (Sheikh Hasina),’ he said while speaking to reporters at the National Burn and Plastic Surgery Institute Hospital. ‘They’re trying to confuse the world by fabricating falsehoods, such as claims that Hindu homes are being torched and Hindus are being killed in Bangladesh. But, in this age of technology, their efforts are failing,’ Rizvi added. As part of the initiative by ‘Amra BNP Poribar’, Rizvi visited patients at the hospital who had sustained injuries during the student-led mass movement. He said the false propaganda being spread by India gives an impression that violent murderers and bloodthirsty people dominate the neighbouring country. The BNP leader also alleged that India has been shedding ‘crocodile tears’ for Sheikh Hasina since it used her to protect its own interests. He strongly condemned the disrespect of Bangladesh’s national flag in India, as well as the recent attack on the Assistant High Commission of Bangladesh in Agartala. ‘They (Indians) have gone so far that they have torn down the flag of our independent beloved motherland. As per Vienna Convention, they have committed a terrible and serious international crime by raising their hands on our diplomatic officials,’ the BNP leader said.

First admitted to Narsingdi Sadar Hospital they were referred to Dhaka Medical College Hospital as their condition deteriorated. Other injured were treated at local hospitals and clinics. Local people said that the clash occurred as a result of a longstanding enmity between Raipura upazila Jubo League leader Abid Hasan Rubel and Raipura municipality Awami League vice president Harun Aur Rashid over dominance in the area.

Some even call for sending UN peacekeepers to Bangladesh—or intervening in the country—based on these reports, he said, adding that ‘We want fair investigations.’ In recent weeks, Alam said, there have been greater efforts by the interim government, political, religious, and civil society leaders urging people to stay calm during religiously tinged incidents. ‘Some of us have shown extraordinary political maturity in these events,’ he said in a Facebook post from his verified account. But the Bangladesh Hindu Buddha Christian Unity Council’s reports have ‘systematically exaggerated’ the violence perpetrated against the minority people, Alam said. He said they hope top secular and liberal newspapers will do their own probe into the alleged cases of religious violence reported by the Council. ‘We also hope international rights groups such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International will also do similar investigations,’ the press secretary added. The HRW did an excellent investigation into the massacres of Hefazat activists in 2013, Alam said, hoping that HRW will do a similar probe. Alam acknowledged that violence against minorities happens in Bangladesh. ‘We are still not the ideal country as far as communal harmony is concerned. We hear reports of discrimination based on religion,’ Alam said, adding that there are also regular bouts of violence triggered by allegedly blasphemous Facebook posts. When the Netra News debunked the Bangladesh Hindu Buddha Christian Unity Council’s report on the attacks on the Hindu community in the post-revolution days, the Press Secretary said he expected the group to make a statement. The Netra News report, Alam said, showed almost all nine Hindu dead who the minority council claimed to have been killed in communal hatred-related violence were connected to other reasons such as political, personal and other causes. The Unity Council also made a similar ‘controversial report’ on the attacks of minorities in Bangladesh in July this year, said the press secretary. Alam said the unity council’s reports have a far-reaching impact. When a British MP recently spoke about the attacks on minorities in Bangladesh, it seems he quoted the council’s report, the press secretary observed. The report on attacks on Hindus was cited more than 11 million times in social media. ‘What I’ve learnt is that the powerful and deep-pocketed Hindu American groups, Indian national and regional newspapers, and top Indian commentators cite its report to portray the state of minorities in Bangladesh,’ Alam said. ‘Experts told me the Unity Council’s reports have been the single biggest source of misinformation on anti-minority violence in Bangladesh,’ he added.

Wahiduddin believes Bangladesh to get political govt next year,"The planning and education adviser Wahiduddin Mahmud on Saturday expressed hope that Bangladesh would see an elected government next year. He made the comment at the Annual BIDS Conference on Development (ABCD) 2024, organised by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, on the day. ‘This is my opinion, but I am not sure what will happen,’ he, however, clarified. ‘No country can become a rich nation overnight. It requires collective efforts and long strategy. Our interim government is here for a short term,’ said Wahiduddin Mahmud, also a prominent economist. ‘We are still trapped in the lower middle-income bracket, far from achieving what the Philippines has, let alone Malaysia,’ the adviser noted. He mentioned that Vietnam’s per capita income in the 1990s was similar to Bangladesh’s. Now, it’s per capita income is 40-50 times of Bangladesh. They secure $20 billion annually in foreign direct investment, while we attract just $2 billion. ‘We lack substantial global economic integration and need significant advancements in education and technology,’ the interim government adviser added. The interim government led by Nobel laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus was formed on August 8 following the fall of the authoritarian regime of Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India amid a student-led mass uprising on August 5.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252211/wahiduddin-believes-bangladesh-to-get-political-govt-next-year
Man killed over land dispute in Moulvibazar,"A 40-year-old man was killed and eight others were injured in a clash between two groups of villagers over the ownership of a piece of land at Sonatiki village in Rajnagar upazila of Moulvibazar district on Friday.

Quoting local people, officer-in-charge of Rajnagar Police Station, Shah Mohammad Mubasshir, said Abdul Hakim, son of Tajmul Mia of the village, had long been at loggerheads with Misrab over the ownership of a piece of land.

South Korea president faces impeachment over martial law fiasco,"South Korea’s embattled president Yoon Suk Yeol stopped short of resigning Saturday over his declaration of martial law, with a vote to impeach him hours away and mass street protests planned in Seoul. Yoon stunned the nation and the international community Tuesday night by imposing martial law for the first time since the 1980s and deploying troops and helicopters to parliament. Lawmakers, however, managed to vote down the decree, forcing Yoon to rescind the order in the early hours of Wednesday in a night of extraordinary drama for a country assumed to be a stable democracy. ‘The declaration of martial law arose from my urgency as the president,’ he said in a televised address, the first time he has appeared before the public since plunging the country into political chaos. ‘However, in the process, I caused anxiety and inconvenience to the public. I sincerely apologise to the citizens who were greatly distressed.’ The opposition and even key members of his own party have called for him to step down, and parliament is set to vote later Saturday on his impeachment, although the opposition leader has told AFP it is not clear the motion can pass. Police have said they expect tens of thousands of anti-Yoon protestors to take to the streets ahead of the vote, with organisers hoping two lakh people will attend. Yoon did not offer to resign in his brief address, saying only that he would ‘entrust the party with measures to stabilise the political situation, including my term in office.’ His party is divided on the issue, with lawmakers late Friday sticking to the official line that they would block impeachment, even after party head Han Dong-hoon said Yoon must go or Seoul risked more political chaos. ‘The normal performance of the president’s duties is impossible under the (current) circumstances, and an early resignation of the president is inevitable,’ Han Dong-hoon told reporters early Saturday. The opposition bloc holds 192 seats in the 300-strong parliament, while Yoon's People Power Party has 108. Just eight ruling party lawmakers need to defect for the vote to get the two-thirds majority it needs to pass. One PPP lawmaker has already publicly said they will vote with the opposition. A successful vote would suspend Yoon from office pending a ruling by the Constitutional Court. Police have begun investigating Yoon and others for alleged insurrection. ‘I will not shy away from the issue of legal and political responsibility regarding the declaration of martial law,’ Yoon said during his address. On Friday night, at least 15,000 anti-Yoon protesters braved the cold weather to gather in Seoul's Yeouido district, where the National Assembly is located. Some camped out all night despite freezing temperatures while opposition lawmakers remained in parliament, fearing Yoon might try some desperate measure to remain in office. An opinion poll released Friday put backing for the 63-year-old president at a record low of 13 percent. In his address to the nation late Tuesday, Yoon said martial law would ‘safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness.’ Security forces sealed the National Assembly, helicopters landed on the roof, and almost 300 soldiers tried to lock down the building. But as parliamentary staffers blocked the soldiers with sofas and fire extinguishers, enough lawmakers got inside – many climbed walls to enter – and voted down Yoon’s move. Soldiers had been ordered to detain key politicians, lawmakers from both parties have said, with one top soldier involved saying this week they had been told to ‘drag out’ lawmakers from parliament. The episode brought back painful memories of South Korea’s autocratic past and blindsided its allies, with the US administration only finding out via television. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yul on Friday that he ‘expects the... democratic process to prevail’.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/252209/south-korea-president-faces-impeachment-over-martial-law-fiasco
Junta chief dissolves Burkina Faso govt,"Burkina Faso’s ruling military leader on Friday dismissed the country’s prime minister and dissolved the government, according to a presidential decree transmitted to AFP. No reason was given for the dismissal of Apollinaire Joachim Kyelem de Tambela, who was named as premier in October 2022 after the coup that brought Captain Ibrahim Traore to power. ‘The prime minister’s official functions are terminated,’ said the decree, adding that members of the dissolved government would ‘carry out ongoing business until the formation of a new government’. The prime minister had served at the head of three successive governments, surviving each reshuffle. The west African country was plunged into instability by a January 2022 coup in which Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba seized power from elected president Roch Marc Christian Kabore. Little more than eight months later, Damiba himself was overthrown by Traore, 36, who now heads the junta regime. Along with fellow Sahel nations Mali and Niger, which are also led by military juntas, Burkina Faso has seen a surge of attacks by jihadist armed groups. Nearly two million of its citizens have been forced from their homes by the conflict, which has killed more than 26,000 people since 2015, including soldiers and civilians, according to monitoring group ACLED.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/world/252208/junta-chief-dissolves-burkina-faso-govt
Syrian govt loses control of Darra,"The Syrian government on Monday lost control of the symbolic southern city of Daraa and most of the eponymous province, which was the cradle of the country’s 2011 uprising, a war monitor said. ‘Local factions have taken control of more areas in Daraa province, including Daraa city... They now control more than 90 per cent of the province, as regime forces successively pulled out,’ the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. In Daraa province, only the Sanamayn area is still in government hands, Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the British-based monitor with a network of sources in Syria, told AFP. Earlier Friday, local factions seized the Nassib-Jaber border crossing with Jordan, the Observatory said, with Jordan closing its side of the crossing, interior minister Mazen al-Faraya said. Daraa province was the cradle of the 2011 uprising against Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s rule, but it returned to government control in 2018 under a ceasefire deal brokered by Assad ally Russia. It was a rebel bastion at the height of the civil war in the early 2010s. Former rebels there who accepted the 2018 deal were able to keep their light weapons. Daraa province has been plagued by unrest in recent years, with frequent attacks, armed clashes and assassinations, some claimed by the Islamic State.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/world/252207/syrian-govt-loses-control-of-darra

Israel accused of  genocide in Gaza,"Amnesty International accused Israel Thursday of ‘committing genocide’ against Palestinians in Gaza since the start of the war last year, saying its new report was a ‘wake-up call’ for the world. The London-based human rights group said its findings were based on satellite images documenting devastation, fieldwork and ground reports from Gazans as well as ‘dehumanising and genocidal statements by Israeli government and military officials’. Israel dismissed the findings as ‘entirely false’, denouncing the report as ‘fabricated’ and ‘based on lies’. Amnesty chief Agnes Callamard accused Israel of treating the Palestinians in Gaza ‘as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them’. ‘Our damning findings must serve as a wake-up call to the international community: this is genocide. It must stop now,’ she said in a statement. Hamas, which has been fighting Israel in Gaza, welcomed the report as a ‘message to the international community... on the need to act to bring an end to this genocide’. Israel’s offensive has killed at least 44,580 people in Gaza. Independent UN human rights experts have accused Israel of genocide several times, and South Africa brought a case against Israel to the UN’s top court in December 2023 accusing it of ‘violating the genocide convention by promoting the destruction of Palestinians living in Gaza’. The case is still ongoing. Callamard insisted at a press conference in The Hague that ‘the existence of military objectives does not negate the possibility of a genocidal intent’. She said Amnesty had based its findings on the criteria set out in the UN Convention on the Prevention of Genocide. But an Israeli army spokesperson said the report’s findings ‘fail to account for the operational realities’ it has faced. Amnesty International said it ‘deeply regrets that some members’ of its Israel branch ‘have chosen to distance themselves’ from the report. ‘Amnesty International stands by its rigorous research and conclusions,’ a spokesperson said. Amnesty’s 300-page report points to ‘direct deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructures where there was no Hamas presence or any other military objectives’ as well as the blocking of aid deliveries, and the displacement of 90 percent of Gaza’s 2.4 million people. Palestinians have been subjected to ‘malnutrition, hunger and diseases’ and exposed to a ‘slow, calculated death’, Amnesty said. The rights group, which is also due to publish a report on the crimes committed by Hamas, cited 15 air strikes in Gaza between October 7, 2023 and April 20, which killed 334 civilians, including 141 children, for which the group found ‘no evidence that any of these strikes were directed at a military objective’. The Amnesty report also referenced dozens of calls by Israeli officials and soldiers for the annihilation, destruction, burning or ‘erasure’ of Gaza. Such statements highlighted ‘systemic impunity’ as well as ‘an environment that emboldens... such behaviour’. ‘Governments must stop pretending that they are powerless to terminate Israel’s occupation, to end apartheid and to stop the genocide in Gaza,’ Callamard said. ‘States that transfer arms to Israel violate their obligations to prevent genocide under the convention and are at risk of becoming complicit.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252204/israel-accused-of-genocide-in-gaza
Normalcy returns in Sunamganj village after protest at FB post,"Normalcy prevails at Doarabazaar upazila in Sunamganj at the prompt intervention by the local administration and social leaders after a tense situation created following a controversial facebook post.

Reopen closed state-run jute and sugar mills: labour leaders,"Leaders of different labour rights organisations on Friday urged the government to reopen 26 nationalised jute mills and nine sugar mills closed during the fascist Awami League regime. They made the urge at a human chain formed jointly by the Jatiya Sramik Federation, the National Garments Workers Federation and the Ekota Garments Sramik Federation in front of the National Press Club to press the demands. Addressing the human chain as the chair, labour leader Amirul Haque Amin said that in the past 15 years of misrule of the Sheikh Hasina regime 26 nationalised jute mills and nine sugar mills were closed under the excuse of cumulative losses in the mills. But, workers were not responsible for the losses, he said and blamed mismanagements for the losses in the mills. As a result, a huge number of workers became jobless and now passing their days helplessly, Amirul said. He called on the interim government headed by Professor Muhammad Yunus to take immediate steps to reopen the nationalised mills and bring back Tk 28 lakh crore that was laundered to different countries during the past 15 years’ misrule of Sheikh Hasina government. Labour leader Abul Hossain said that the mismanagement of Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation was mainly responsible for the losses in the nationalised jute and sugar mills. Besides, 64 private jute mills remained closed during the rule of the Awami League, he said. Labour leaders  ASM Zakaria, Anwar Ali, Lokman Ali, Mohammad Dider Hossain, Monira Munni also spoke. The then Awami League government on June 2, 2020 closed all the state-owned jute mills, rendering around 50,000 workers jobless overnight. Six months later, the AL regime, for the last time, decided to suspend production at six state-run sugar mills to ’minimise the accumulated losses’ of the Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corporation.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252200/reopen-closed-state-run-jute-and-sugar-mills-labour-leaders
IAB leaders demand reforms before elections,"Leaders of Islami Andolan Bangladesh on Friday demanded comprehensive reforms before the next national election. The call was made during the central convention of its student wing, Islami Chhatra Andolan Bangladesh, held at Suhrawardy Udyan in Dhaka. IAB amir Syed Muhammad Rezaul Karim emphasised the need to learn from past experiences, stating that necessary reforms had to be completed before holding elections. He warned that discussions about elections without reforms could lead to falling into conspiratorial traps. Highlighting the shortcomings of previous elections, Rezaul said that past elections had only strengthened fascism. ‘We aim to establish a national government through elections based on a proportional representation system,’ he added. Senior presidium member Syed Mosaddek Billah Al Madani criticised the past regime, claiming that the ousted Awami League economically crippled the country. ‘Banks have gone bankrupt, and massive looting has occurred under the fascist regime. Corrupt individuals, bribe-takers, and collaborators of Sheikh Hasina must be brought to justice,’ he added. Presidium member Ashraf Ali Akon stressed the need for constitutional reforms to transform Bangladesh into a welfare state. ‘A fascist government may fall, but the eradication of fascism requires systemic changes,’ he remarked. Senior joint secretary general Gazi Ataur Rahman expressed hope for uniting all Islamic forces to participate in the upcoming election, ensuring their collective voice is heard.

CJ calls for justice as a universal right,"Chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed on Friday urged legal professionals to stay committed to ensuring justice as a universal right in society. ‘Whether in the courtroom, the classroom, or the community, let us remain committed to building a society where justice is not a privilege but a universal right,’ he said. The chief justice made the call while addressing the Rajshahi University Law Alumni Association council at the Supreme Court Bar Association. ‘Together, we have the power to transform challenges into opportunities and to pave the way for a future defined by equity and integrity,’ he said. Pointing at the alumni, he said that they carried the responsibility of upholding the ideals of justice, equality, and human rights. Their work as legal professionals, educators, and advocates played a pivotal role in shaping a society rooted in fairness and the rule of law. ‘It is imperative that we continue to use our knowledge, influence, and resources to champion the causes of the marginalised, strengthen the legal framework, and promote access to justice for all,’ he said. Pointing at the Supreme Court lawyers, Refaat Ahmed said that they acted as bridges between the judiciary and the people as their role extended beyond the courtroom. ‘You educate citizens about their rights and responsibilities, empowering them to engage with the legal system. Your work ensures that the law is not an abstract concept but a living promise of fairness and equality for all.’ Refaat Ahmed said that when he took the oath as the 25th chief justice of Bangladesh, he was acutely aware of the immense responsibility placed upon his shoulders. From the very moment of his appointment, he recognised the urgency of addressing the challenges that have long impeded the full realisation of the judiciary’s potential. ‘To this end, on September 21, I unveiled a comprehensive roadmap for judicial reform. This initiative is a cornerstone of my vision to strengthen our judiciary and its capacity to serve the people with integrity and efficiency,’ said the chief justice. ‘In reinforcing the judiciary’s independence from the legislative branch, we have restored and strengthened the Supreme Judicial Council following the disposal of the 16th Amendment review case,’ he said. Recognising the critical importance of access to justice, the chief justice introduced a capacity test alongside the existing means test for invoking legal aid services.

Indian police fire tear gas to halt farmers’ protest march,"Indian police fired tear gas Friday at protesting farmers attempting to march to the capital New Delhi to push for their longstanding demand of guaranteed minimum prices for their crops. Farmers this week revived their dormant ‘March to Delhi’ campaign seeking to channel the spirit of a dramatic protest in 2021, when they stormed the capital on tractors. To stop the farmers at Shambhu, about 200 kilometres (125 miles) north of the capital, police set up heavy barricades of concrete blocks and lines of razor wire in advance of  the march. Authorities also suspended mobile internet services along the route of the procession to prevent communication among the protesters. Waving blue and yellow flags, the farmers broke through part of the blockade before they were halted by police. ‘In February, we held four rounds of talks with the government but since then there have been no further discussions on our demands,’ farmer leader Sarwan Singh Pandher told reporters. ‘We want the government to let us exercise our democratic right to protest.’ In addition to price guarantees for their harvest, farmers are demanding a grab-bag of other concessions, including loan waivers and increased compensation for land acquired by the government several years ago. Farmers in India have political influence due to their sheer numbers, and the renewed protests come as the national parliament is in session. Two-thirds of India’s 1.4 billion people draw their livelihood from agriculture, accounting for nearly a fifth of the country’s GDP, according to government figures. Protests in November 2020 against agricultural reform bills lasted for more than a year, a major challenge to efforts by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to reform the sector. A year later, their campaign prompted Modi to repeal three contentious laws that farmers claimed would let private companies control the country’s agriculture sector.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/252196/indian-police-fire-tear-gas-to-halt-farmers-protest-march
Autocracy Resistance Day observed,"Different political parties on Friday observed Autocracy Resistance Day to mark the day of the fall of autocratic ruler HM Ershad. On December 6, 1990, military dictator HM Ershad stepped down in the face of a mass upsurge and handed power over to a caretaker government, ending his nine years of rule which began with his coup on March 24, 1982. This year the political parties observed the day with the aspiration of democratic transition of the country after the fall of fascist Sheikh Hasina government amid student-led mass uprising on August 5. The political parties urged the interim government headed by Professor Muhammad Yunus to hold a free, fair and credible election as early as possible for democratic transition in the country. DUCSU-90 and All Party Students Unity organised a discussion at the National Press Club to mark the day where Bangladesh Nationalist Party standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said that after the fall of fascist Sheikh Hasina, scope for a democratic transition had been created in the country. He called on the interim government to hold next general elections as early as possible for democratic transition of the country. Marking the day of the Fall of Dictatorship and the Restoration of Democracy on Friday, BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman on Thursday night in a statement urged all democratic forces to remain united so that the defeated powers do not rise again. He characterised the Awami League as a tyrannical adversary of democracy. Tarique said, ‘After bringing an end to the fascist Sheikh Hasina’s autocratic regime, we must pursue our relentless struggle to fully restore democracy and embed democratic values in both the state and society.’ ‘The autocratic Ershad-led Jatiya Party, in alliance with the AL, supported fascism for sixteen years, during which time, the rule of law, judicial independence, and fundamental human rights were repeatedly violated in the country,’ he said. ‘They removed the neutral, non-partisan caretaker government system from the constitution,’ he said. Tarique recounted how Ershad, on the  March 24, 1982, betrayed his professional duty and oath by ousting elected president Justice Sattar at gunpoint, thereby destroying democracy, imposing martial law, and derailing constitutional politics. He accused Ershad of undermining democratic institutions, mentioning that on December 6, 1990, democracy was reclaimed with the combined strength of students and the people, concluding the defeat of dictatorship after a nine years mass movement led by Khaleda Zia. The BNP leader also said the students and the people once again triumphed over a violent fascist force on August 5, 2024 through a mas uprising.

Special Magistrate Court judge Kazi Shariful Islam approved the remand for prime suspect Chandan Das, 35, and another accused in the case, Ripon Das, 27, after a hearing at 3:30pm on Friday, said Mofizul Haque Bhuiyan, public prosecutor of Chattogram Metropolitan Sessions Judge Court. Chattogram Metropolitan Police additional deputy commissioner Mofiz Uddin, said, ‘The police sought a 10-day remand in custody but the court granted seven days’ remand for Chandan  Das and five days’ remand for Ripon Das.’ The accused were brought to court under tight security. After the remand application was granted, lawyers gathered on the court premises, raising slogans demanding death penalty for the perpetrators. They also called for a ban on Hindu religious organisation ISKCON. Prime suspect in the case Chandan Das was arrested from Bhairab railway station on Thursday and was handed over to the Chattogram Metropolitan Police the same night. On the same evening, acting on a tip-off, the police arrested Ripon Das from Anwara upazila of Chattogram. Although Ripon was not initially named in the case, the police identified him as a suspect from video footage. The police said that in the viral video of the incident, Chandan, wearing an orange T-shirt, black pants, and a helmet, was seen attacking lawyer Saiful with a knife. Ripon, wearing a blue shirt and holding a knife, was also captured in the footage. So far, 11 individuals have been arrested in connection with the lawyer murder. A total of six cases were filed so far over the incidents centring the lawyer murder near the court premises in Chattogram city.

A grieving father’s visits to hospitals to support injured,"Md Mannan Gazi nowadays visits hospitals whenever he can, offering support to those injured during the July-August mass uprising. The father of two has developed the habit since his only son, Md Shrabon Gazi, was slain during the July-August mass uprising. These visits bring some peace in his unquiet heart. ‘My son is gone forever. At least I don’t have to see him suffer in pain. But those who were injured are enduring endless agony—some have lost limbs, and  some are left with paralysed body parts,’ Mannan, a worker paid on a master roll basis at Savar’s Central Cattle Breeding and Dairy Farm, said on November 20. Shrabon Gazi was hit by a bullet in the head in Savar bus stand area about 2:00pm on August 5 as he joined the ‘Long march to Dhaka,’ a protest demanding the ouster of the Awami League government, just several hours before Sheikh Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled to India. Shrabon returned from Malaysia on July 16, the day six people were killed during the protests against quota system in civil service jobs. He took admission in the software engineering department at Tunku Abdul Rahman University of Management and Technology in February this year. A 2022 Higher Secondary School Certificate graduate from Savar Laboratory College, Shrabon joined the protest with his friends the very next day, on July 17. On the morning of August 5, Shrabon, who was then 19-year-old, embraced his mother, Shahnaz Begum, from behind and said with a playful smile, ‘Ma, I am going to war.’ Known for his cheerful and light-hearted nature, Shrabon’s words didn’t alarm the mother who thought it was his usual frolic. He left home around 10:40am. Later that day, Shahnaz spoke to him for the last time over the phone at 1:30pm, asking him to return home for lunch. ‘He loved eating hot meals. I prepared lunch and was waiting for him, but he never came back,’ said Shahnaz, tears streaming down her face. About 2:30pm, Shrabon’s father received a call telling him that his son had been shot. Later, Gonoshasthaya Samaj Vittik Medical College pronounced Shrabon brought dead at 3:50pm. ‘I, along with my friends, was in the Bus Stand area when the police first started firing tear gas and rubber bullets at us. Around 1:30pm, we saw many people running as the police began firing live bullets, leaving several dead and many injured,’ said Shovon, a Jahangirnagar University student who joined the protest that day. The grieving parents, who live in the residential quarters of the dairy farm, are now left with Shrabon’s 11-year-old only sister Mahima Elahi. Shrabon, who loved to sing and dance, was a source of hope not just for his immediate family but for their relatives also. To prepare him to take on family responsibilities in the future, they collectively raised Tk 7,00,000 to send him abroad for studies, as his father’s monthly income is only Tk 16,000. A murder case was filed with the Savar police on August 22, but the family expressed concerns, stating that many innocent people were wrongly named as accused in the case, which they did not want. Shrabon was buried in the local cemetery in the Dairy Farm area on the same day. The Directorate General of Health Services, on September 24, said that after a preliminary investigation it had listed 708 people, including Shrabon, having died in the uprising. Its listing is still going on. Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on November 17 said that around 1,500 people were killed and 19,931 others injured during the uprising.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252193/a-grieving-fathers-visits-to-hospitals-to-support-injured
Protests against mission attack in India continue,"Protests against the attack on the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in India’s Agartala continued for the fifth consecutive day on Friday in Dhaka city. Different political parties and student bodies staged protests on the day demanding punishment for the perpetrators and an immediate end to propaganda against Bangladesh in the Indian media and repression against Muslims and other minorities in India. Amid growing tension between the two neighboring countries, the Border Guard Bangladesh is prepared and alerted to prevent any untoward situation, according to BGB officials. Bangladesh mission in Agartala came under attack by a group of Indians on Monday afternoon during their protests demanding the release of Bangladesh Hindu community leader Chinmoy Krishna Das, now in jail in a sedition case. The Inquilab Mancha marched towards the Indian High Commission in Dhaka from Gulshan-2 circle on Friday to submit a memorandum to the Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh protesting at the attack on Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala. Minutes after the march began at about 4:00pm, the police intercepted it while a huge number of law enforcers blocked both sides of the road and the police also brought armoured personnel carriers and water cannons. The traffic movement in the city’s diplomatic zone was halted for more than 45 minutes due to the protests. The protesters held a brief rally in the face of interception. Addressing the rally, Inquilab Mancha spokesperson Sharif Osman Hadi said that Hindutva mobs kept attacking Muslim, Christian and Dalit communities as they had not spared the Bangladesh mission in Agatala. ‘Hindutva politicians’ constant threats to demolish religious sites, churches and shrines like Ajmer Sharif has been further fueling  intolerance in the region,’ he said, adding that India largely violated the rights of religious and ethnic minority communities. All the people in Bangladesh live in religious harmony regardless of their ethnicity and religion, he said. The protesters held placards inscribed with slogans, including ‘Babri’s fall a day recall, protect minorities, justice for all’, ‘Minority women are not paraded naked on our streets’, ‘India has become Asian Israel’ and ‘Hindutva Must Stop! Hindutva is Heinous’. Later, three members of the Inquilab Mancha, including its spokesperson Sharif Osman Hadi and two members Fatema Tasnim Jhuma and Abdullah Al Jaber handed over the memorandum to a security official of the high commission. Dhaka Metropolitan Police Gulshan division deputy commissioner Mohammad Tareq Mahmud told New Age that it was a peaceful demonstration and three leaders submitted the memorandum to a security official with the help of the officials of the DMP’s Diplomatic Security Division. He said, ‘We will not allow any anarchy in the diplomatic zone and that is why we have deployed such a number of police members. Anyone can hold peaceful protests considering their rights.’ He said that the tight security measures around the Indian High Commission in Dhaka would be continued until further notice. In the six-point memorandum, the Mancha demanded that the Indian government must ensure safety, security and protection of Bangladesh diplomatic missions, the officials and their family members and property in accordance with the Vienna Convention and bring the perpetrators to justice through a transparent and credible judicial system. It also demanded an immediate end to the killing of Bangladeshis in the Bangladesh-India border and prosecution of the perpetrators of the previous border killings through transparent and credible investigations and end to discrimination against the indigenous tribal populations of Manipur and visible measures to compensate and rehabilitate the victims of religious and ethnic violences at the hands of Hindutva mobs. Hundreds of people on Friday held a procession in Dhaka protesting at propaganda by Indian media against Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Tisri Insaf Dal brought out a procession from the north gate of the Baitul Mukarram National Mosque in Dhaka after Jumma prayers. The protesters said that India kept spreading propaganda against Bangladesh although there was no attack or torture on people of the Hindu community in Bangladesh. They also alleged that Muslims were being constantly tortured in India and India must stop the torture of Muslims first. They also said that the peace-loving people of Bangladesh never attacked Hindu temples and worship places as Bangladesh is a country of non-communal consciousness. If India does not stop telling lies about Bangladesh, the Muslim community of Bangladesh will give a stern response against their propaganda. The Ganosamhati Andolan in a press release on Friday said that fascist Sheikh Hasina was trying to return to the country with an Indian conspiracy. At the central convention of its student wing Islami Chhatra Andolan Bangladesh at Suhrawardy Udyan in the city, Islami Andolan Bangladesh leaders condemned the attack on the Bangladesh mission in Agartala and Indian aggression. Islami Andolan Bangladesh senior nayeb-e-amir Syed Muhammad Faizul Karim said that India was provoking a war. ‘India has never been able to build a true friendship with us and has not treated its own minorities well,’ said Faizul, adding that India insulted and hurt Bangladesh and the people of Bangladesh would not bow down to anyone.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/252192/protests-against-mission-attack-in-india-continue
145 Bangladesh citizens call on Indians to resist sectarianism,"One hundred and 45 eminent citizens of Bangladesh in a statement on Friday called on Indian citizens to resist the menace of sectarianism in India. ‘We will fight against sectarianism in our country, and you [Indian nationals] too will stand against sectarianism in your country,’ said the statement addressing the Indian nationals. ‘You will resist this conspiracy while upholding the aspiration of those who gave their lives in democratic movements and mass  uprisings in your country,’ it said. ‘This struggle is a continuous fight of the people of both countries against the exploitation, plunder, oppression, and domination of the Indian capital. It is our united struggle against division, hatred and religiously driven conspiracies,’ the statement added. It acknowledged that the Indian people expressed solidarity with the July-August student-led mass uprising, which forced fascist Sheikh Hasina to flee to India, leading to the ouster of the fascist Awami League government on August 5. The statement, however, expressed concern that several extremist sectarian forces in India persistently kept provoking tensions to disrupt the friendly relations among the people of the region, particularly at a time when diplomatic relations between Bangladesh and India were at their lowest. The citizens in the statement said that they did not view Indian nationals and the government through the same lens, mentioning that Indian nationals had also been fighting against Hindutva forces and sectarianism. Mentioning that sectarianism is a major problem in the subcontinent, the statement read that the ruling classes of this region used sectarianism as a weapon to hide their failure to ensure crucial rights, including the right to education and healthcare, price hikes of essential commodities, and violence against women. ‘They [the ruling class] use this tactic as a means to secure votes from both majority and minority groups. Repeated attacks on minorities are especially observed to occur during shifts in the political landscape.’ It added that many Indian media outlets had not circulated real incidents that happened in Bangladesh and have continued to do so, citing the example of an accident on the Dhaka-Agartala-Dhaka route in Brahmanbaria on November 30. An Indian media outlet, however, portrayed the accident as a planned attack and in several hours of the circulation of the news the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala came under attack, and the national flag of Bangladesh was desecrated. ‘Although the Indian government expressed its regret, it did not take any effective measures to stop the circulation of such false news,’ the statement reads. It also expressed astonishment over the Indian government’s stance in favor of the recently arrested former ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, who had been fired from ISKCON and was not an Indian national. The statement said that Saiful Islam Alif, a Chattogram court assistant public prosecutor, was stabbed to death during a clash between law enforcement agencies and followers of Chinmoy when he was produced before a court, adding that due to the efforts of Bangladesh nationals, major untoward incidents that could have arisen from this event were prevented. The Hindu community in Bangladesh has always been committed to establishing a non-communal Bangladesh, it added. The signatories of the statement included economist Anu Muhammad, professor and writer Salimullah Khan, Bangladesh Open University pro-vice-chancellor Sayeed Ferdous, writer and activist Rahnuma Ahmed and writer and singer Farzana Wahid Shayan.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/252191/145-bangladesh-citizens-call-on-indians-to-resist-sectarianism-
Govt committee mulls selling 16 BEXIMCO cos,"A high-powered government committee has recommended the selling of Beximco Group’s 16 readymade garment companies to pay the workers’ dues. The advisory council, formed to review labour and business conditions at Beximco Industrial Park, also suggested shutting down of several other companies owned by the group during its first meeting held at the labour ministry on November 28, according to the meeting minutes. The meeting, held on November 28 at the labour ministry and chaired by labour adviser M Sakhawat Hossain, was attended by finance adviser Salehuddin Ahmed, home adviser Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, and industries adviser Adilur Rahman Khan. Also present at the meeting were labour secretary AHM Safiquzzaman, finance secretary Md Khairuzzaman Mojumder, Bangladesh Investment Development Authority executive chairman Ashik Chowdhury,  attorney general Md Asaduzzaman, Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Khondokar Rashed Maksud, Beximco Limited’s receiver Md Ruhul Amin, and Janata Bank managing director Mujibur Rahman. Bangladesh Investment Development Authority executive chairman Ashik Chowdhury suggested categorising Beximco’s 161 companies into three groups. According to his recommendation, the profit making Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd, classified as ‘Category A’ by the advisory council formed for reviewing the Beximco companies, should have legal suspension over the transfer of its shares. Among the 32 companies listed in ‘Category B’ by the advisory council, 16 were currently operational garment and textile factories, the rest of the 16 companies under the category are not currently operational. Ashik Chowdhury for the 16 ‘Category B’ companies, that are not operational, suggested that management rights could be sold to reputable international operators through lending institutions like Janata Bank and IFIC Bank, following their submission of Expressions of Interest. The remaining companies of the Beximco’s 161 companies have been put under ‘Category C’ by the advisory council. The BIDA executive chairman mentioned that for the ‘Category C’ companies, payment of wages and allowances for three months could be discontinued. The advisory council meeting decided that Janata Bank would fund the next three months’ wages and allowances for Beximco Industrial Park workers, and then finalise the Expression of Interest for selling the ownership of the 16 Category B companies that are not operating. The meeting also decided to hire an experienced lawyer to respond to the ongoing writ petition in the High Court, with costs covered by the Ministry of Finance. Also within a week, the authorities would take control of the share transfer process of Beximco companies, to be implemented by Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission and Beximco administrator. At the meeting, finance adviser Salehuddin Ahmed emphasised the responsibility of relevant authorities to ensure workers’ wages and working conditions, noting that recent disruptions, including road blockade demanding unpaid wages, had negatively impacted various sectors, including the garment industries.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/trade-commerce/252190/govt-committee-mulls-selling-16-beximco-cos
"Edn sector reeling from graft, mismanagement","Corruption, mismanagement, politically-driven selections and sexual harassment had reigned the country’s education sector during the immediate past 15-year rule of the now ousted Awami League, a White Paper has revealed. The sector had been infested with corruption in areas, including admission and tuition fees, mismanagement, politically driven selections in the committees to run educational institutions, irregularities committed by public officials, question paper leaks, and sexual harassment, the paper states. Underscoring the significant fiscal opportunities lost to corruption, the ‘White Paper on the state of Bangladesh economy’ also states that halving tax exemptions could double education funding and triple health allocations. Senior educationists have observed that corruption in the sector impacted all the concerned and the government should take immediate actions to curb the identified irregularities. A 12-member committee headed by economist Debapriya Bhattacharya prepared the White Paper and submitted it to chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on December 1. According to the paper, some studies point to specific forms of corruption in the education sector, including the collection of unauthorised fees for school admission, not distributing free textbooks, coercing students to take private tuition, and taking bribes to disburse school stipends and grants. The paper also mentions misconduct, absenteeism and neglect of duties by teachers, inactive school management committees, and a lack of accountability mechanisms. The paper highlights two particular areas—question paper leaks in the public examinations, and sexual  abuse in which female students were sexually harassed and grades were awarded in exchange of sexual favours. The paper has also found corruption in procurement activities, invisible corruption committed by officers assigned to monitor education at the grassroots, politically-driven handpicking of managing committee members leading to the incorporation of unqualified people into the committees. Dhaka University’s Institute of Education and Research director Professor Hosne Ara Begum told New Age that not only the students but the teachers also were affected by the corruption that deeply harmed the quality of education. ‘The government should take initiative to free the sector from corruption,’ she added. Echoing Professor Hosne Ara, BRAC University professor emeritus Manzoor Ahmed also said that the government should take steps to establish an environment free from corruption and mismanagement in the sector. The government’s approaches should be different for the government, non-government and private educational institutions as their problems were different, he added. About the question paper leaks, the White Paper states that the trend became rampant after 2014 when question papers of the public examinations, including Primary School Certificate, Junior School Certificate, Secondary School Certificate, and Higher Secondary Certificate were leaked on a regular basis. Multiple university and medical entrance exam papers were also leaked, it read. Citing a research conducted by the Transparency International Bangladesh, the paper states that the collusion among the officials like deputy commissioner, upazila nirbahi officer and bank officials was responsible for leaking question papers at the local level, adding that at the institutional level, a section of teachers shared photographic images of the papers with the students over cell phones. The paper also states that a nexus among question setters of creative section, business running coaching centres and publishing guide books, and a section of teachers and moderators engaged in the question setting process was responsible for the question leaks. Some unskilled teachers and educational institutions trying to top the performance list also provided leaked questions to the students to secure better results. The relevant authorities’ brazen denial of the question leaks further weakened the enforcement of law and not disclosing the observations of the probe committees encouraged the culprits to go as usual with their business, observes the paper. The paper also mentions that sexual harassment prevention committees have yet to be established at all educational institutions although a High Court directive, years back in 2009, ordered to do so. Those universities that have such committees often have appointed members from within their high-ranking officials inherently curbing its capacity, the report reads. The paper also mentions that private tutoring and ‘high-stakes tests’ are largely undermining learning and depriving economically poor families of the fruits of education. The increasing social inequalities in the country is expanding to the education sector to address which urgent attention is necessary, the While Paper observes. The interim government on August 29 formed the committee to prepare the White Paper.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252189/edn-sector-reeling-from-graft-mismanagement
Probe into high-profile corruption cases stalled,"The Anti-Corruption Commission has failed to file any case against four high-profile corruption suspects, including former inspector general of police Benazir Ahmed and former revenue board official Matiur Rahman, as it has yet to complete its probe into allegations against them. The two other corruption suspects are former army chief general Aziz Ahmed, and former Dhaka metropolitan police commissioner Asaduzzaman Mia. All the four former government high officials face allegations of amassing massive illegal wealth at home and abroad and laundering money. All the four inquiries have by now gone past the 75-day time allowed by the ACC rules to complete an inquiry. The commission, on completion of a probe into allegations against a corruption suspect, files a case against the person on finding adequate evidence. Officials said that the ongoing inquiries had already found information on a huge amount of moveable and immovable assets owned by all the four corruption suspects. Besides the sluggish pace of these much-talked-about probes, allegations of negligence are also there against its officials tasked with these inquiries. Experts say that failure to complete the inquiries in due time would let the corruption suspects find ways out of the ACC net, limiting the commission’s scope to lay claim on the wealth they have gained allegedly through illegal means. The commission during its inquiry found a vast amount of illegal movable and immovable assets of former police chief Benazir and former president of the NBR’s Customs, Excise, and VAT Appellate Tribunal, Matiur Rahman and their family members, but as of December 5 it has not filed any case. Besides, there is also no visible progress in the ACC inquiries against former army chief Aziz Ahmed and former DMP chief Asaduzzaman over allegations of corruption. Refusing allegations of negligence, anti-corruption commission director general (prevention) Md Aktar Hossain told New Age, ‘We are conducting sincere probes against them and are hopeful to complete the inquiries soon.’ ‘We would file case action against them based on the inquiry reports and after the approval of the commission,’ he added. ‘Delays in inquiry, investigation and trial might benefit corruption suspects,’ said Transparency International Bangladesh executive director Iftekharuzzaman. ‘Failure to complete inquiry, and investigation in due time creates many scopes for corruption suspects to find ways out of the ACC net,’ he said. Amid massive allegations of corruption, the commission on April 18 decided to run an inquiry into the assets of Benazir and his family members, but Benazir left the country 15 days after the probe had been launched. Before his departure, the former police chief withdrew Tk 13 crore from his bank accounts and is now staying abroad along with his family. More than seven months have elapsed now since the inquiry had begun, but the ACC inquiry team, led by its deputy director, Hafizul Islam, has yet to complete the inquiry or file a case against him despite available information about his illegal wealth, said commission officials. According to the commission’s findings, Benazir and his family members amassed illegal wealth of around Tk 44 crore. Of the assets, Benazir amassed illegal wealth worth around Tk 9.25 crore, and his wife Jissan Mirza owned Tk 21.34 crore. The couple’s elder daughter, Farheen Rishta has amassed illegal wealth worth Tk 8.10 crore, and another daughter, Tahseen Raisa has become owner and wealth worth Tk 4.76 crore. Apart from this, the inquiry also found that 25 acres of land at Bandarban Sadar was taken on lease in Benazir’s name, two plots in the names of Benazir and his wife Jissan Mirza in Munshiganj, Jissan Mirza also owned a seven-storey building at the capital’s Uttara, and six flats in Dhaka’s Adabar area. The value of these assets was not mentioned anywhere, and the value of these assets has not been determined in the inquiry, according to the findings. Matiur Rahman was first exposed to public scrutiny after video footage had gone viral on social media showing his second wife’s son, Mushfiqur Rahman Ifat, buying a goat for Tk 12 lakh ahead of Eid-ul-Azha this year. The goat scandal involving his son brought his assets under the anti-corruption agency’s scrutiny on June 4 of this year for the fifth time in the past two decades. In 2004, the commission launched the first inquiry against Matiur, while it conducted three more inquiries in 2008, 2013 and 2021 without any breakthrough. The ACC officials allegedly gave Matiur clean chits in each of the four inquiries due to his influence. During the ongoing inquiry, the commission found evidence of 3,523 decimals of land, and shares of 19 companies, and Tk 13.44 crore in 116 bank accounts and 23 beneficiary owner’s accounts owned by Matiur and his family members. The commission also found his eight apartments in Dhaka, a multi-storey building in the capital’s Bashundhara residential area. The anti-corruption commission, on August 18, decided to conduct an inquiry against former Dhaka Metropolitan Police chief Asaduzzaman Mia over allegations of amassing illegal wealth. More than three months have elapsed, but the commission’s inquiry team is yet to complete the inquiry against Asaduzzaman. According to the allegations, Asaduzzaman’s family took advantage of legalising undisclosed money by investing in the real estate sector and hid information to get a Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha plot. His daughter, Ayesha Siddika, legalised Tk 1.72 crore by purchasing a flat in 2020, while his wife, Afroza Zaman, got a 7-katha plot under a special provision by violating the rule. Media reports said that Asaduzzaman and his family members own a huge amount of wealth, including flats, plots, and houses. In Dhaka, his wife owns a house and two flats and his daughter owns a flat. Moreover, 233 decimals of land have been found in the names of Asaduzzaman’s wife and children in Gazipur and Narayanganj districts. The commission, on September 4, decided to carry out an inquiry against former army chief retired General Aziz Ahmed over allegations of amassing massive illegal wealth. No visible progress has been made so far in the probe against the retired general. According to the allegations, Aziz has several houses, including in DOHS at Mirpur and Nikunja in Dhaka. He also allegedly purchased houses and several hundred bigha of land in the names of his younger brothers, including Tofayel Ahmed in Dhaka. Aziz also laundered money through hundi and banking channels for business purposes and purchasing property in Malaysia, Singapore, and Dubai, according to commission officials. Corruption allegations against Aziz came to the fore after the United States imposed sanctions on him and his immediate family members on May 21, citing his alleged involvement in serious corruption.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252188/probe-into-high-profile-corruption-cases-stalled-
Bangladesh look to bounce back,"Bangladesh women’s cricket team pacer Jahanara Alam was optimistic about to bounce back in the three-match T20I series against Ireland after the 12-run defeat in the first match at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium. The second match is scheduled to begin at 2:00pm in Sylhet today. Bangladesh fell short in what could’ve been their record chase after being set a target of 170 runs on Wednesday. They got a brilliant start, but losing wickets in the middle overs and a double-wicket maiden in the 19th over by Orla Pendergast proved costly. But the veteran pacer Jahanara, who made a comeback after almost six months, was hopeful that they would clinch the series by winning the remaining matches. ‘The start was good. The top four batters started well for us. So we are confident that we can clinch the series. We don’t want to let down the people of Bangladesh,’ said Jahanara ahead of the second match. The 31-year-old pacer also pointed out tactics to restrict the touring Irish side, who won their first T20I against Bangladesh in more than six years. ‘We know they’ve three or four key batters in the likes of [Amy] Hunter, [Gaby] Lewis, and [Leah] Paul. If we can dismiss them quickly, then we can bowl them out easily, and a positive result can be achieved.’ The top order hasn’t been consistent in recent times. Now that they got a good start in the series, Jahanara feels more confident moving forward. ‘We’re hopeful with the fact that four batters got their rhythm back; one has been in rhythm. And if one or two can be added to that list, then in this batting track we can post a good total or chase one,’ she added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252179/bangladesh-look-to-bounce-back

A path towards inclusive democracy,"This year in July and August, WE WITNESSED in July and August the end of 16 years’ fascist regime of Sheikh Hasina, which was toppled in a mass uprising on August 5. India’s dominance over Bangladesh has also been dismantled along with this. As Bangladesh embarks on a new democratic journey, systemic reforms are urgently needed to ensure sustainable governance, accountability and justice. The interim government has prioritised these issues. Protesters of the July-August uprising, directly or indirectly, demand a fundamental change in the political culture of the past five decades. One critical aspect of this transformation is to re-evaluate the structure of the government. The adoption of a parliamentary system after the fall of HM Ershad’s regime in the 1990s was groundbreaking. However, today it demands a fresh scrutiny to assess its effectiveness. While it is challenging to confirm whether foreign conspiracies or influences played a role in the shift, the international geopolitical context cannot be overlooked. Many political analysts believe that if the presidential system had remained, Sheikh Hasina would not have won against Khaleda Zia in a direct presidential election. This is because of Khaleda Zia’s stronger grass-roots support and political popularity.  Presidential system IN THE light of the reality, a transition from a parliamentary to a presidential system can enhance stability and leadership. However, even under a presidential system, if power is not balanced between the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary, authoritarian rule could emerge. For instance, if the president assumes control of all branches without checks and balances, power will again converge in one individual. To prevent this, a two-term limit and a five-year tenure are crucial for the president’s role. The measures ensure opportunities for new leadership and maintain the balance and stability of democratic institutions. It will reduce risks of abuse of power and dictatorship, fostering a democratic environment where leadership change happens regularly through established processes.  Breaking dynastic politics SUCH a system is especially vital for countries such as Bangladesh, where political parties often revolve around familial ties and self-interest, leaving little room for merit-based leadership. The parliamentary system exacerbates this tendency as dynastic influence dominates party decisions and leadership succession. This perpetuates ineffective leadership, hindering development and undermining democratic values, as seen in Sheikh Hasina’s autocratic rule. In a presidential system, candidates must earn nationwide support based on personal qualifications, vision and charisma. This shift can weaken dynastic politics and unqualified succession, emphasising merit and democratic values in leadership. It will also foster a political culture rooted in accountability and break the cycle of corruption.  Addressing political violence WHILE transitioning to a presidential system is one solution, addressing political violence is equally crucial. Parties resorting to violence to suppress opponents should be disqualified from elections. An impartial arbitration board under the Election Commission, including a High Court judge and subject experts, will ensure accountability.  Campaign finance reforms EXCESSIVE campaign expenses and nomination trading are root causes of corruption in politics. Imposing strict spending limits and requiring the approval of majority of grass-roots activists for nominations will curb this culture. Violations must result in swift and effective punishment.  Election transparency To protect voter’s rights, election processes must be transparent and technologically advanced. Monitoring by police or military personnel of polling centres is essential. Live closed-circuit television camera broadcasts outside centres can help to identify irregularities or voter harassment in real time. Adopting the Canadian voting model could be transformative where voters verify their ballots by scanning them, ensuring accurate recording. At the end of the day, the machines produce immediate results, with manual counting as an option if objections arise. To ensure transparency, copies of results signed by party agents should be provided to local media.  Bicameral legislature INTRODUCING a bicameral legislature could ensure better representation and policy-making. In such a system, one chamber (the lower house) is elected by the people and has legislative authority while the other chamber (the upper house), composed of professionals and experts, reviews and approves legislation. This balance of power prevents the elected lower house from enacting laws driven solely by partisan interests.  Empowering local government LOCAL governments must be empowered with autonomy to implement developmental projects. Members of parliament should not be involved in project execution or financial decisions. Instead, their role should be limited to proposing and lobbying for regional development projects. Transparent tendering processes should be established to prevent corruption. Additionally, two laws granting members of parliament undue privileges must be abolished. The law allotting government plots to members of parliament in Dhaka should be repealed and previously allotted plots should either be returned or purchased at market rates. And, the duty-free car import facility for members of parliament must be cancelled, with those who have benefited required to pay the applicable taxes.  Reform road map A phased implementation plan is necessary: In the first year, 2025, constitutional amendments for a presidential system, bicameral legislature, term limits, and local government autonomy should be done; and the initial preparation by the Election Commission, including updating the electoral rolle, redefining constituencies and adopting modern election technology should be done. In the second year, 2026, local government elections and national and presidential election dates should be announced. And, in the third year, power should be transferred to the elected president. Implementing such reforms will establish a transparent, accountable, and inclusive governance system. By encouraging peaceful political activities, eliminating corruption and prioritising public welfare, Bangladesh can become a beacon of democracy in the region.

Failure to contain food inflation unacceptable,"This is frustrating that the government measures taken to fight inflation — a cause for serious concern for people, especially low-income people — have yielded no results. The upward trend in inflation reached, as the Bureau of Statistics says, 11.38 per cent in November from 10.87 per cent in October. Food inflation has, meanwhile, reached a record high of 14.63 per cent in urban areas and 13.41 per cent in rural areas. Persistent food inflation was a major issue that aggrieved the people, who were disappointed about inadequate regulatory measures during the Awami League government. Low-income people, one of the major groups that actively participated in the July-August uprising, expected that the interim government would be sincere about containing food inflation by facilitating timely import and breaking market cartels that are largely responsible for food inflation. Unfortunately, the situation has not improved and, in fact, worsened to an extent. Prices of most goods have increased over four months since the interim government assumed office on August 8. Prices of rice, vegetables, eggs and chicken have surged excessively over a couple of months while prices of other goods have remained high. The government has taken some initiatives such as increased market oversight, more import, reduction in import duties on some products and setting prices for some goods. The government has also appointed a special task force up to the district level to monitor and assess the market and goods supplies. Earlier, the authorities reduced import duties on sugar, potatoes and onions, but it failed to influence goods prices. The Department of Livestock Services set prices for eggs and chicken but has failed to make traders follow the prices. The authorisation of egg import, the demand for which is met with local production, has also failed to arrest the price increase. The measures have failed because, as the Consumers Association of Bangladesh says, all longstanding issues in the supply chain, especially market manipulation by business cartels, have persisted. Food inflation and food insecurity have remained two major concerns. The recent food security update of the World Bank put Bangladesh in the red zone in the past year. The update, which covers a year beginning in May 2023, says that the persistent high food inflation has pushed majority of low- and fixed-income people into food insecurity. A further increase in food inflation is believed to have worsened the situation. Weak market management, poor policies, insufficient and untimely imports and errant businesses are what have pushed food inflation up and the government has failed to address the issues adequately and go tough against manipulation. The authorities should show the dynamism needed to contain inflation, especially food inflation. The authorities should establish an effective market oversight mechanism, bust the syndicates and attend to supply issues.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/252174/failure-to-contain-food-inflation-unacceptable
Govt should try people who left food security in peril,"UNCURBED corruption that had plagued the agriculture sector for the 15 years of the authoritarian regime of the Awami League, toppled in a mass uprising on August 5, has put food security in peril. The white paper on the state of the Bangladesh economy, which a committee that the government instituted on August 29 submitted on December 1, lists corruption as one of the eight major reasons that have held back the agriculture sector, which accounts for 14 per cent of the gross domestic product and provides more than 40 per cent of the national work force with jobs. Agriculture had been mired in unbridled corruption, as the white paper says, for the duration whilst challenges of low labour productivity, stagnation in growth production, limited access to finance and the shortage of fertiliser had compounded the sector. The document lists the ‘mechanisation of agriculture work integrated management’ project, meant for the distribution of 51,300 agro-machinery units for the period of 2020–2025 to increase agricultural production as a scandalous event. The project involved Tk 30.2 billion. But, the theft of funds by businesses and officials marred the distribution of agricultural machinery. Leaders of the Awami League are said to have used their political power to expropriate millions of dollars of the project money. The Anti-Corruption Commission initiated an investigation of the corruption in the farm mechanisation project in 2023 after the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division had levelled the allegations of fund embezzlement. Funds for an initiative to provide 50 per cent of the loan earmarked for cottage, micro, small and medium enterprises for the agricultural sector by 2024 to foster rural income are also reported to have been misappropriated. The document says that Awami League leaders in collusion with corrupt bureaucrats have exploited the agricultural sector as a means to legalise their wealth amassed illegally. The white paper notes the case of a former inspector general of police who legalised part of his illegal wealth with investments in fisheries as an example. The document also says that corruption of dealers caused a 59 per cent decline in the marginal productivity of fertiliser in the aman season and an 18 per cent decline in the boro season. The government in 2016–2017 distributed about Tk 176 billion in agricultural loan and 6.82 per cent of the fund went in bribe to bank officials. The document says that about 54 per cent of the fund was spent on agriculture. In 2019, as the document says, the government could meet 25.6 per cent of the rice procurement target with purchase from farmers because of inadequate information dissemination. In 2020, the Anti-Corruption Commission suspected bribery and extortion in rice procurement. It is now imperative for the government to credibly investigate all allegations of corruption that the white paper on the state of the economy has levelled against people in the government and in the ruling quarters who have robbed the agriculture sector and, thereby, harmed food security during the 15 years of the Awami League government and hold them to account.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/252173/govt-should-try-people-who-left-food-security-in-peril
