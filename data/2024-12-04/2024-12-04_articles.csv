Revised DAP proposal prioritises commercial interest: discussion,"Speakers, including urban planners, on Wednesday said that the recent revised proposals for Dhaka’s Detailed Area Plan published by Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha ignored the city’s livability, civic amenities, and the environment while prioritising the commercial interests of housing traders. They made the observation at an online discussion organised by the Institute for Planning and Development on planning and development review, titled ‘Whose Interests Drive the Repeated Revisions of DAP: IPD’s Observations.’ They alleged that initiatives to revise the DAP for 2022–2035 twice within just two years of its finalisation were driven by pressure from business and vested interest groups. The IDP president, Adil Muhammad Khan, said in his keynote speech that RAJUK’s revised proposal for the DAP focused solely on increasing the size and height of buildings, neglecting crucial environmental issues, including protecting floodplains, wetlands, and agricultural land. He alleged that housing traders and a few professionals called for the cancellation or suspension of the DAP solely to increase the Floor Area Ratio, also known as FAR, for building construction. ‘The revised proposal’s area-based and block-based FAR standards could further jeopardise Dhaka’s livability as they fail to adhere to urban planning principles aimed at creating a livable city,’ he added. Akter Mahmud, a professor at the Department of Urban and Regional Planning at Jahangirnagar University, said that several policymakers at Rajuk fail to recognise the importance of urban planning, resulting in their surrender to the unjust demands of vested interest groups. The professor emphasised that decisions must prioritise public welfare to improve Dhaka’s livability. Farhadur Reza, an associate professor at the JU, emphasised the need to conduct research on the impact of a FAR value exceeding three in an area and evaluate how effective the roads would remain. To address the problems of Dhaka, the DAP must be revised using sustainable planning strategies and approaches that prioritise public interest, livability, and environmental preservation, the speakers said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252030/revised-dap-proposal-prioritises-commercial-interest-discussion

Apparel exports up 12.34pc in July-Nov,"Bangladesh’s readymade garment exports increased by 12.34 per cent year-on-year to $16.12 billion in July-November of the current financial year 2024-25 compared with those of $14.35 billion in the same period of FY24, driven by a pre-holiday rush for Christmas, Black Friday and Thanksgiving, as well as the clearing of the backlog of orders. According to the Export Promotion Bureau data released on Wednesday, the country’s overall export earnings in the five months of FY25 also increased by 11.76 per cent to $19.91 billion compared with those of $17.81billion in the same period of FY24. Bangladesh’s export earnings in November 2024 increased by $15.63 per cent year-on-year to $4.12 billion compared with those of $3.56 billion in the same month of 2023. Export earnings from readymade garment in the month also increased by 16.25 per cent to $3.31 billion compared with those of $2.84 billion in the same month of the past year. Mahmud Hasan Khan, a former vice-president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, attributed the rise in apparel shipments to the accumulation of deferred orders from August and September. While he acknowledged that global buyers were placing more orders with Bangladeshi exporters, he pointed out that prices remained low, as manufacturers were compelled to accept orders at reduced rates due to increased production capacity. Mahmud also expressed concerns about the sustainability of this export growth, warning that it could falter without improvements in law and order and adequate banking support. He said that the aftershocks of recent political instability and labour unrests could surface in the coming months, as buyers might reconsider placing orders if the instability persisted. According to the EPB data, that export earnings from the knitwear subsector rose by 12.23 per cent to $8.96 billion in the five months of FY 25 compared with those of $7.97 billion in the same period of FY24. Earnings from woven garments grew by 12.48 per cent in the July-November period of FY25, reaching $7.17 billion, up from $6.38 billion in the corresponding period of the previous financial year. EPB vice-chairman Md Anwar Hossain said that despite challenges from the recent political changeover, Bangladesh’s export earnings had continued to grow, driven by the resilience of entrepreneurs and the dedication of workers. Labour situation has improved in the RMG sector and most of all the factories are running in full capacity across the country, he said while publishing the export earnings data for November at a press briefing held at the EPB office in the capital Dhaka. Anwar also said that export earnings had shown encouraging growth in recent months, driven by the peak season for shipments, which included the completion of the backlog of orders, the pre-holiday rush and the buyers’ end-of-year inventory management. The EPB data showed that the home textile sub-sector registered 5.03 per cent growth in exports in the July–November period, with earnings reaching $326.83 million. Exports of jute and jute goods in in the five months of FY25 totalled at $341.7 million, showing a decline of 9.99 per cent. Earnings from agricultural products such as vegetables, fruits and dry foods grew by 8.34 per cent to $495.38 million over the five months of FY25. Export earnings from engineering products increased by 5.70 per cent to $205.8 million in July-November of FY25. Exports of frozen and live fish rose by 11.62 per cent, amounting to $198.09 million in the period. Earnings from leather and leather goods exports totalled at $466.39 million, registering a growth of 7.61 per cent in the July-November period of FY25. Pharmaceutical exports amounted to $92.58 million, an increase of 13.14 per cent in the period. The EPB data also showed that exports of plastic products grew by 35.38 per cent, reaching $131.82 million in the five months of FY25.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/apparel/252026/apparel-exports-up-12.34pc-in-july-nov

Bashir calls for innovation in textile sector to face post-LDC challenges,"Sheikh Bashir Uddin, adviser to the Ministries of Textiles, Jute, and Commerce, has urged stakeholders to brace for challenges following Bangladesh’s graduation from least developed country status. Speaking at the National Textile Day 2024 seminar on Wednesday, he emphasised the need for unity and strategic planning to address potential disruptions in the sector. ‘We have many challenges ahead as an LDC graduate nation. The decision to reduce incentives is the right step. After LDC graduation, incentives will no longer be available, and we will face export market tariffs,’ Bashir Uddin remarked at the event held at the Jute Diversification Promotion Centre at Farmgate in Dhaka. Bashir Uddin called for increased adoption of solar energy and advanced technologies to reduce costs and enhance efficiency in the textile industry. ‘Solar power is a viable solution to cut expenses in this sector. Additionally, new entrants into the industry must be professionally skilled and academically prepared to drive its growth,’ he said. The seminar, titled ’Overview of the Textile Sector in Bangladesh: Problems, Prospects, and Smart Way Out,’ was organised by the Ministry of Textiles and Jute. It featured notable experts, policymakers and industry leaders addressing the sector’s current state and future. Md Abdur Rouf, secretary of the Ministry of Textiles and Jute, presided over the seminar, while Md Shahidul Islam, director general of the Textiles Department, delivered the opening address. Professor Ayub Khan from BGMEA University of Fashion and Technology highlighted the need for a ‘talent bank’ and skill development to ensure sustainable industry growth. BKMEA president Md Hatem stressed the importance of long-term planning and timely policies to advance the sector. ‘The development of the textile industry requires coordinated efforts and visionary strategies,’ he said. The event brought together senior officials, including additional secretaries of the Ministry of Textiles and Jute Subrata Sikder, Arifur Rahman Khan and Taslima Kaniz Nahida, along with BTMC chairman Brigadier General Md Ziaul Haque. Stakeholders from various sectors also participated, underscoring the importance of collaboration in addressing industry challenges.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/apparel/252024/bashir-calls-for-innovation-in-textile-sector-to-face-post-ldc-challenges
"Govt asks pvt sector to import, sell 3.92 lakh tonnes of rice by Dec 22","The government has allowed the private sector to import 3.92 lakh tonnes of rice within this month, aiming to keep rice price stable on the retail market across the country, according to the food ministry. A total of 92 private rice importers have already got the government approval to import the 3.92 lakh tonnes of rice, which includes 2.73 lakh tonnes of boiled and another 1.19 lakh tonnes of non-boiled ‘Atap’ rice. With this latest order,  the food ministry has given permission to some 277 private sector companies separately for the fourth times to import a total of 14.81 lakh tonnes of boiled and non-boiled ‘Atap’ rice within this month. ‘We have approved 92 private sector companies to import 3.92 lakh tonnes of boiled and non-boiled ‘Atap’ rice aiming to keep rice price stable on the retail market,’ said M Habibur Rahman Hosaini, additional secretary (procurement and supply) of the food ministry. The order has been issued almost two weeks ago to import the amount of rice immediately with a view to covering the gap of current Aman harvest, which is likely to end by the end of this month, said the official. The private importers must supply the rice on th eretail markets within December 22, according to the order. ‘The importers have to sell these amounts of rice in sacks directly on the market instead of re-packaging by the imported companies,’ said the official. While talking to BSS, Rice Arotder Samity general secretary Nirod Baran Saha said, ‘The government’s rice import decision would reduce the rice price further on the market. Even the import also will affect the newly harvested paddy price as the price of per kilogram of paddy is now at Tk 36 to 36.50.’ Earlier, the food ministry had allowed 185 private sector companies to import around 10.89 lakh tonnes of rice – where 7.92 lakh tonnes were boiled and the rest 2.97 lakh tonnes were non-boiled ‘Atap’ rice. The importers were asked to sell those amounts of rice by December 10. The public sector-accumulated food storage till Wednesday was at 10,88,351 tonnes – where some 6,66,728 tonnes of rice , 4,21,171 tonnes of wheat and the rest 681 tonnes of paddy.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/252023/govt-asks-pvt-sector-to-import-sell-3.92-lakh-tonnes-of-rice-by-dec-22
"BB relaxes loan classification, provisioning rules for CMSMEs","The Bangladesh Bank has relaxed the rules of loan classification and provisioning for the cottage, micro, small and medium enterprises sector to create more employment opportunities through increasing investment. The central bank on Wednesday issued a circular to this end. As per the circular, financial institutions will have to keep 5 per cent provision on the outstanding amount of loan or lease kept in the ‘Special Mention Account’ after netting off the amount of interest suspense. But, 0.25 per cent provision will have to be kept for regular loans in the CMSME sector. For CMSME, financial intuitions will have to keep 5 per cent provision for sub-substandard loans, 20 per cent provision for doubtful loans and 100 per cent provision for bad and loss-classified loans or lease. For all other loans or lease, financial intuitions will have to keep 20 per cent provision for sub-substandard loans, 50 per cent provision for doubtful loans and 100 per cent provision for bad and loss-classified loans or lease.

OECD warns of protectionism weeks before Trump return,"The OECD warned Wednesday that protectionist trade measures pose a major risk to disrupting the world economy, just weeks before Donald Trump is set to return to the White House. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based body that advises industrialised nations on policy matters, never named Trump in its updated analysis of the world economy. But with the president-elect vowing to slap tariffs on US trading partners after his return to power next month, it was abundantly clear that the OECD was warning about Trump’s possible measures. While the organisation raised its 2025 global growth forecast to 3.3 per cent, it cautioned that ‘greater trade protectionism, particularly from the largest economies’ poses a ‘downside risk’ along with geopolitical tensions and high public debts. On the campaign trail, Trump threatened blanket tariffs of at least 10 per cent on all imports and since his election has vowed to slap 25 per cent import tariffs against Canada and Mexico, top US trade partners. ‘Increases in trade-restrictive measures could raise costs and prices, deter investment, weaken innovation and ultimately lower growth,’ the OECD warned in its economic outlook. ‘Further increases in global trade restrictions would add to import prices, raise production costs for businesses and reduce living standards for consumers,’ it added. During his first term in office from 2017 to 2021, Trump slapped tariffs on certain products from China and other trading partners, including the European Union, but on a smaller scale than the measures he has pledged to take upon his return to the White House. A recent study by the Roland Berger consultancy calculated the cost of the US measures and likely countermeasures by China and the EU at more than $2.1 trillion through 2029. Trump is far from the only risk in terms of protectionist measures. The Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine showed the dependency of many countries upon global trade, but instead of facilitating the exchange of goods and service many countries have sought to shorten certain supply chains and protect markets. A spat has also broken out between Brussels and Beijing after the EU imposed import tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. China has retaliated with tariffs on EU brandy, including cognac. The OECD noted ‘the global economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience despite being subject to major shocks such as the pandemic and an energy crisis.’ It even raised its global growth forecast for next year to 3.3 per cent, an increase of 0.1 percentage points from its previous outlook in September, due in large part to the strong performance of the US economy. The OECD now sees the US economy expanding by 2.4 per cent next year, up from its September forecast of 1.6 per cent growth. It also raised its forecast of British growth next year by 0.5 percentage points, to 1.7 per cent, due to higher public spending planned by the new Labour government. China’s economy is now expected to expand by 4.7 per cent next year, an increase of 0.2 percentage points, while India’s growth forecast was raised 0.1 percentage points to 6.9 per cent. But both France and Germany saw to 0.3 percentage point cuts to their 2025 growth forecasts, to 0.9 per cent and 0.7 per cent, as both countries face political crises amid mounting fiscal pressure. The downgraded forecast comes as France’s new minority government faces being brought down Wednesday by lawmakers after it forced through the adoption of the social welfare budget.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/business-economy/252021/oecd-warns-of-protectionism-weeks-before-trump-return

Joyful Tigers earn memorable win,"Taijul Islam bagged his 15th five-wicket haul in Test cricket while Jaker Ali played his career-best knock as Bangladesh registered a memorable series-levelling 101-win over the West Indies on the fourth evening of the second and final Test at Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica, on Tuesday. This was Bangladesh’s first win in the Caribbean in 15 years and their third away win in 2024, their highest in a year. Bangladesh thus completed a remarkable turnaround after being dismissed for 164 in the first innings of the Test. This was the lowest first innings total for them where they have won, with the previous lowest being 220 against England at Mirpur in 2016. ‘It is something that these young players were looking forward to. It is nice to see them come back in their way after losing the first Test match. It is a total joy for me,’ an overjoyed Bangladesh head coach, Phil Simmons, told TV broadcasters after the match. The win came when Nahid Rana, who captured five wickets in the first innings, clean bowled Shamar Joseph with a yorker. Simmons was full of praise for the 22-year-old pace sensation who bowled above 140 kph regularly and hit the length consistently. ‘We underrated the young fast bowler’s ability to assess the situation. The things he tells me before taking the field make me wonder if this is his fourth or fifth Test match,’ said Simmons. ‘He is impressive with pace, but also with his hunger to learn. He keeps growing, and I am sure we will see a lot more of him,’ added the former West Indies opener. But it was the experienced left-arm spinner Taijul who demonstrated all his variations to get the better of the home team batters. He grabbed four of the first five wickets that fell when they were chasing a big target of 287 on a difficult pitch. Taijul’s scalps include Kavem Hodge (55) and Kraigg Brathwaite (43)—the hosts’ two top scorers. Simmons hailed Taijul as a thinking bowler. ‘Taijul loves hitting the stumps, so he bowls more arm balls than (conventional) spinners. He seems to be getting better every game. You could see that there was more thought in his bowling here in every session,’ he said. Stand-in captain Mehidy Hasan Miraz rotated his bowlers effectively as Bangladesh got their expected breakthroughs before the hosts could pose any threat. Taskin Ahmed, who was later adjudged joint player of the series along with West Indies’ Jayden Seales, took two wickets. Another pacer Hasan Mahmud also grabbed two. All of those came on the back of a superb innings by Jaker, who unleashed everything against the West Indian bowlers in his 91 off 106 balls. He scored 62 out of the team’s 75 runs in the first session of the fourth day. Jaker now has as many fifty-plus innings in his first three Tests—second Bangladeshi after Zakir Hasan to do so. Jaker hit eight fours and five sixes—also the second highest for a Bangladeshi batter in an away Test innings. ‘Jaker scored three fifties in successive Tests, so he knows his game,’ said Simmons. ‘We saw that he can also take on every bowler. He needs to take what he gets from here and try to improve on it. This is not always going to be the way it is.’ Jaker finished what Shahadat Hossain, Shadman Islam, and Mehidy started on the third day with an aggressive intent to put the hosts under pressure. Simmons loved that too. He said, ‘I loved the way the batters came out with a positive attitude. They had a survival attitude in the first few games.’ ‘Yesterday [Monday], you saw that they were saying, “I have come to play the game.” I loved and enjoyed it. I made sure that they know that it is the way we have to play from now on,’ Simmons added. The teams will now move to St Kitts, where the three-match ODI series will be played with the first match on December 8.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252017/joyful-tigers-earn-memorable-win
Rana rattling his way into lore,"The West Indies players came out with a visible fury on the third day afternoon. The umpires had to warn them. ‘He talked a lot,’ one of the close-in fielders said, pointing at Bangladesh opener Mahmudul Hasan Joy. Three balls later, he got out for a duck, edging one to second slip. The celebrations were ecstatic. If someone started watching the game at that point, they would end up wondering what had happened for the Caribbeans to get so angry. Well, something did not happen. Someone did. Bangladesh had never beaten a full-strength West Indies side on Caribbean soil. They were the perennial victims of the pace and bounce the West Indian quicks dished out, including the infamous 43 six years back. For all they could do, Bangladesh could never threaten them. There was no reason for an outrage on their part—they knew there was no need for that. The wins would come anyway. Well, until they got to bat in Jamaica. And until a certain 22-year-old came to bowl from the Michael Holding end. In his first over in Sabina Park, the tall, lanky, not-so-well-built pacer broke the 150 kph barrier twice. For the first time against Bangladesh, West Indies felt threatened. From the end named after the guy who was called ‘Whispering Death,’ Nahid Rana suddenly showed them that they had to face the chin music they were only used to throwing at the Tigers. Rana made them uncomfortable. While they managed to see him off with just a wicket on the second day, there was no stopping him on the third as he ran through them, picking up his first five-for. And for all his pace and terror, the standout image from his spell was a big smile on his face and a thumbs up for Zakir Hasan after he managed to bounce Kraigg Brathwaite out. And as West Indies crumbled, handing Bangladesh an 18-run lead despite a meagre first innings total, they suddenly felt the need to talk. In hindsight, they should have asked someone from Pakistan—then all of it wouldn’t have been that big a surprise. Because just months back, in his first away series, Rana had walked up to the home of Shoaib Akhtar—the Rawalpindi Express—and made the Pakistani batters fear for their lives with raw pace. The Pakistan batters were visibly uncomfortable, and Bangladesh fans truly delighted. This was new for them. They were at the wrong end of pace for all two decades of their red-ball lives. This time they were chanting for it. Bangladesh never had an express pacer. Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, probably the pioneer of fast bowling in the country, was reportedly fast, hitting 90 miles an hour early in his career. Injuries made sure it was not the case for long. Rubel Hossain was considered fast but could never be consistent in red-ball cricket, and even his pace was never consistently breaking past the 140 kph mark. Taskin Ahmed was quick in his early days too before injuries saw him focus on other things. Ebadot Hossain showed some promise before settling on accuracy rather than pace, and now, following an ACL injury, it’s unlikely he will ever hit the erratic high speeds he displayed early on. Thus, Rana came as a revolution. Even when he focuses on his accuracy, he hits 145 kph easily. Guess what he could do if he decided to just bowl fast. Bangladesh fans, while relishing what Rana has done with the red cherry, will still be wary of hope. Injuries reducing their pacers is something they have seen happen to the best they have produced—Mashrafe, Talha Jubair, Taskin, Mustafizur Rahman, and Ebadot. The silver lining, though, is that the Tigers now have a deep enough pace contingent that ensures that Rana doesn’t need to be strained, especially across formats. All Bangladesh needs to do is protect the revolution they have found. Then, they will find themselves at the receiving end of the fury from the opposition again, because Rana, with his everlasting smile, would rattle them to their bones again.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252016/rana-rattling-his-way-into-lore
Bangladesh look to carry on ODI momentum into T20s,"An in-form Bangladesh women’s team would look to carry on the momentum of their ODI series sweep in the T20I series against Ireland that starts at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium in Sylhet today. Bangladesh has struggled in the shortest format this year, winning only three out of 16 games. They had a dismal World Cup, with their single victory coming against Scotland. But a dominating 3-0 series sweep over the Irish in the ODIs boosted the team’s confidence. ‘Of course we want to win the series as we are on the peak of our form,’ Bangladesh captain Nigar Sultana Joty told reporters in the pre-series press conference in Sylhet on Wednesday. ‘If we can carry on the momentum, then it will be good for us. We are positive and confident but not overconfident’, she added. Bangladesh has had a pretty good record against the Irish. They won eight out of their 11 matches and lost three. This will be the first meeting between the two sides in two years in the 20-over format. Bangladesh have a new-look squad as the likes of batter Sharmin Akter and all-rounder Jannatul Ferdus are making a comeback. But Joty’s focus will be on maintaining the consistency. ‘Supta [Sharmin] apu played so well, and she had that intent; that’s why she got the chance. I’m confident with my team. Players are in touch. Now the important factor is to maintain consistency,’ said the Bangladesh captain. Bangladesh last played in Sylhet in May when they were swept by India in a five-match series. Joty now wants a fresh start from every aspect. ‘This is a different format; the condition is different too. Of course we have to play carefully. The first match is important. If we can start well, then it will have an impact on the whole series.’ The trophy of the series was unveiled in a unique way on Wednesday. Both captains appeared with the traditional attire of a tea-garden worker in the 175-year-old Malnicherra Tea Estate. Joty appreciated the initiative of the BCB. ‘It’s beyond our imagination. It will promote women’s cricket in a different way.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252015/bangladesh-look-to-carry-on-odi-momentum-into-t20s
Syrian forces launch counterattack against Islamist-led rebels,"Syrian government forces launched a counterattack against Islamist-led rebels around the key city of Hama on Wednesday after suffering a string of staggering losses, a war monitor said. Hama is strategically located in central Syria and for the army, it is key to safeguarding the capital and seat of power Damascus. The fighting around Hama follows a lightning offensive by the Islamist-led rebels who in a matter of days seized swathes of territory from president Bashar al-Assad’s control. Key in the rebels’ successes since the start of the offensive last week has been the takeover of Aleppo, Syria’s second city, which in more than a decade of war had never fallen from government hands. In Aleppo, a medical student said that staff at the hospital where he worked were ‘largely absent, with departments working at 50 per cent capacity’. ‘We try to tend to emergency cases that come to the hospital, using medical supplies sparingly,’ he said. While the advancing rebels found little resistance earlier in their offensive, the fighting around Hama has been especially fierce. The city was the scene of a massacre by the army under Assad’s father in the 1980s targeting people accused of loyalty to the banned Muslim Brotherhood. Decades on, the scars of the massacre that sent thousands of Syrians into exile have yet to heal, and Hama was the site of some of the biggest protests early on in the pro-democracy revolt that erupted in 2011 and sparked the civil war. By Tuesday, rebel forces had reached the gates of Hama city, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor, as the fighting sparked a wave of displacement. AFP images showed people fleeing the town of Suran, between Aleppo and Hama, many of them carrying whatever they could take aboard their vehicles. According to the Britain-based Observatory, ‘regime forces launched a counterattack’ in Hama province on Wednesday with air support on the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham rebels and allied factions. Government forces pushed HTS away from the provincial capital by about 10 kilometres, the Observatory said, reporting fierce battles as rebels failed in their bid to capture an area near the city. Syrian state news agency SANA also reported the battle around Hama, saying the army was conducting operations against ‘terrorist organisations’ in the north of the province. Wassim, a 36-year-old delivery driver who lives in Hama city, said that ‘the sounds were really terrifying, and the continuous bombing could be clearly heard.’ ‘I’ll stay home because I have nowhere else to flee to,’ he said. While Hama city was a bastion of opposition to Assad’s rule early in the war, the province is also home to a sizeable Alawite community, followers of the same offshoot of Shiite Islam as the president. The rebels launched their offensive on November 27, the very same day that a ceasefire took effect in the war between the Israeli military and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. Iran-backed Hezbollah is a key backer of Assad’s government and earlier in the war helped prop up his rule. But it suffered a stunning series of blows in its year-long war with Israel, which began after the group launched cross-border attacks in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas. During the war in Lebanon, Hezbollah had to pull back some of its fighters from Syria to focus on its home front. Russia has also been key to keeping Assad in power, directly intervening in Syria’s war in 2015, but it too has been mired in its own war in Ukraine. Nonetheless, the Russian air force is conducting joint raids with the Syrian military, including in Hama province, according to the Observatory. Russia, Iran and Turkey are in ‘close contact’ over the conflict in Syria, Moscow said Wednesday. While Russia and Iran both back Assad, Turkey has backed the opposition. Until last week the war in Syria had been mostly dormant for several years, but analysts have said violence was bound to flare up as it was never truly resolved. According to the United Nations, 50,000 people have been displaced by the latest fighting since it began last Wednesday. The Observatory says the violence has killed 602 people, mostly combatants but also 104 civilians. Since 2011, Syria’s war has killed more than 5,00,000 people and forced millions more to flee their homes. Many of those who took part in the initial protests that sparked the war are now dead, in jail or living in exile. ‘Many policymakers thought, well, Assad won, there is no war,’ said Rim Turkmani, director of the Syria Conflict Research Programme at the London School of Economics. But ‘we’ve been worrying about this for years, that the fact that there is no intense violence doesn’t mean that the conflict is over,’ she said. While the rebels may have advanced swiftly, it does not mean they will have the capacity to hold onto the territory they have captured. Spearheading the rebel alliance is HTS, which is rooted in Syria’s al-Qaeda branch. ‘It’s very well organised, very ideologically driven,’ Turkmani said. ‘However, they spread very quickly and very thin. And I think very quickly they’re going to realise it’s beyond their capacity to maintain these areas and, most importantly, to govern them.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252014/syrian-forces-launch-counterattack-against-islamist-led-rebels
Iran releases Nobel Peace laureate Mohammadi on medical leave,"Iran has released Nobel Peace laureate Narges Mohammadi, jailed since November 2021, for three weeks on medical grounds, her lawyer posted on social media. Over the past quarter century, Mohammadi, 52, has been repeatedly tried and jailed for her vocal campaigning against Iran’s widespread use of capital punishment and its mandatory dress code for women. ‘Based on the advice of the examining doctor, the public prosecutor suspended the jail sentence against Narges Mohammadi for three weeks and she was released from prison,’ Mostafa Nili said on X. ‘The grounds for her release are her physical condition after the removal of a tumour and a bone graft three weeks ago. ‘The tumour was benign but she needs check-ups every three months.’ Mohammadi’s family and supporters swiftly put out a statement protesting that the three weeks’ medical leave was not enough. ‘A 21-day suspension of Narges Mohammadi’s sentence is inadequate. We demand Narges Mohammadi’s immediate and unconditional release or at least an extension of her leave to three months,’ they said in a statement. ‘The denial of proper medical care and sufficient recovery time post-surgery has led to the rapid development of bedsores and intensified pain in her back and legs.’ Mohammadi has spent much of the past decade behind bars and has not seen her twin children, who live in Paris, since 2015. She is serving her sentence in the women’s section of the capital’s notorious Evin prison with around 50 other inmates, according to her husband Taghi Rahmani. In June, she was sentenced to an additional year behind bars for ‘propaganda against the state’. She refused to appear in court for the trial after her request for it to be held in public was rejected. Even behind bars, the Nobel laureate has not given up campaigning, staging protests in the prison yard and going on hunger strikes. In a letter from prison in September, she condemned the ‘devastating oppression’ of women in Iran. The letter was published by her foundation to mark the second anniversary of the nationwide protests that followed the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman detained for an alleged breach of the dress code. Mohammadi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2023, primarily for her campaigning against the death penalty in Iran. Her children collected the award on her behalf as she was in prison at the time. Human rights groups, including Amnesty International, say Iran carries out more executions each year than any other country apart from China, for which no reliable figures are available. Born in the northwestern city of Zanjan in 1972, Mohammadi studied physics and pursued a career in engineering alongside work as a journalist for several reformist media outlets. In the 2000s, she joined the Defenders of Human Rights Center set up by 2003 Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi, an organisation of which Mohammadi remains vice president. She was jailed from May 2015 to October 2020 for ‘forming and leading an illegal group’, campaigning for the abolition of the death penalty in Iran.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252013/iran-releases-nobel-peace-laureate-mohammadi-on-medical-leave
Tokyo to propose 4-day workweek for govt staff,"Tokyo’s governor wants to introduce a four-day workweek for government staffers in the capital as part of a nationwide push to encourage parenthood. Prime minister Shigeru Ishiba has called Japan’s stubbornly low birth rate a ‘quiet emergency’ and has pledged policies like flexible working hours. The expectation that working mothers should still shoulder domestic burdens, raise children and care for relatives is believed to be a key factor behind the dearth of babies. To make work-life balance easier for parents, Governor Yuriko Koike wants to offer civil servants employed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government the option to work a truncated week beginning in April. ‘Lagging behind in women’s empowerment is Japan’s long-standing issue, and overcoming the status quo and making society more diverse and prosperous is key for our bright future,’ she said in a policy speech to the assembly. ‘We will start with thorough support for work-life balance by introducing a more flexible working hour system, such as three holidays per week,’ she added. Under the plan, government staff except shift workers may take up to three days off weekly, but will still need to complete 155 hours per month, Sachi Ikegami, a Tokyo Metropolitan Government official in charge of personnel affairs said on Wednesday. Employees raising young children will also be offered more flexible hours, with work days shortened by up to two hours, Ikegami added. A four-day workweek is rare in Japan but gradually catching on in local governments seeking to strengthen support for parents. While many developed countries are struggling with low birth rates, the problem is particularly acute in Japan where the population has declined for 15 straight years. It has the world’s second-oldest population after Monaco, and its relatively strict immigration rules mean it faces growing labour shortages. Koike, a former minister and television anchor who has governed one of the world’s biggest cities since 2016, won a third term in July on vows to boost Tokyo’s social welfare benefits while acknowledging challenges like inflation and the plummeting birth rate. Her administration plans to submit a draft proposal on the flexible working hours to the Tokyo assembly next year.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/252012/tokyo-to-propose-4-day-workweek-for-govt-staff
Russia supporting N Korea nuclear programme in exchange for troops,"NATO chief Mark Rutte said Wednesday that Russia was giving support to North Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes in exchange for Pyongyang sending troops to fight in the war with Ukraine. He urged NATO members to send enough arms to Ukraine to change the course of the conflict as Russian forces make gains along the frontline. ‘In return for troops and weapons, Russia is providing North Korea with support for its missile and nuclear programmes,’ Rutte told journalists after a meeting of NATO foreign ministers. ‘These developments could destabilise the Korean Peninsula and even threaten the United States.’ Ukraine and its allies say North Korea has sent soldiers to Russia to fight alongside Moscow’s forces in the Kursk region. Rutte has stressed the risk the alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang poses to the United States ahead of Donald Trump’s return to office. Washington’s allies are trying to find ways to convince Trump that it is in his interest to keep up US support for Ukraine. The volatile Republican has cast doubt on continuing vast US military aid to Kyiv and promised to cut a quick deal to end the war. ‘The increasing alignment of Russia, China, North Korea and Iran highlights the global nature of the threats we face, including the escalating dangers of the ongoing war in Ukraine,’ Rutte said. The situation on the battlefield is looking increasingly grim for Ukraine as Trump’s inauguration comes near. Russian forces are advancing along the front line as Kyiv’s fatigued forces struggle with weapons supplies and manpower shortages. ‘We must provide enough support to change the trajectory of this conflict once and for all,’ Rutte said. ‘We discussed what more allies can do to provide critical ammunition and air defences.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252011/russia-supporting-n-korea-nuclear-programme-in-exchange-for-troops

Khulna Univ students block Sonadanga bus terminal,"Students of Khulna University staged a protest on Wednesday evening by blocking the Sonadanga Bus Terminal intersection, following an incident where a student was beaten and teachers were assaulted. The protest began around 5:30pm, with students gathering in front of the bus terminal. At one point, they chased bus owners and workers, creating a tense atmosphere in the area. A contingent of army, navy, and police personnel was deployed to control the situation. According to Mohammad Muhibullah, a student coordinator from Khulna University, the incident started when a bus traveling from Gopalganj to Khulna had a dispute over fare, during which a bus worker assaulted one student. The student informed others about the incident, prompting a group of KU students to gather at the Sonadanga Bus Terminal. Transport workers launched another attack on the students there. As a result, several KU students, including Ashik, Siam, Jisan Ahmed, Arup Basu, Hridoy, and Shahriar Parvez Sad, were injured. Additionally, two teachers were assaulted during the altercation. As news of the assaults spread, a large number of students gathered at the Sonadanga Bus Terminal and blocked the terminal.

Stokes fit as England name unchanged team for 2nd New Zealand Test,"Captain Ben Stokes was named Wednesday in England's team for the second Test against New Zealand in Wellington, allaying concerns over his fitness. The visitors won the first Test in Christchurch by eight wickets inside four days and have stuck with the same XI for the next clash starting on Friday. That includes Stokes, who pulled up while bowling his fifth over on the final day of the first Test and tossed the ball to Gus Atkinson to finish his stint. The inspirational all-rounder stayed on the field and said afterwards there was ‘a bit of stiffness’ in his back stemming from diving for a catch.

West Indies duo fined for behaviour in Bangladesh loss,"West Indies cricketers Jayden Seales and Kevin Sinclair were both fined Wednesday for breaching the International Cricket Council's code of conduct during the second Test defeat by Bangladesh. Fast bowler Seales was fined 25 percent of his match fee ‘for making aggressive gestures’ towards the Bangladesh team after taking a wicket. He also received one demerit point for the offence. All-rounder Sinclair, who was not in the original XI but came on as a substitute fielder, was docked 15 percent of his match fee for sledging. The ICC said he ‘ignored warnings’ from the umpires and ‘continued using aggressive language’ towards the Bangladesh players. Seales recorded outstanding figures of 4-5 in 15.5 overs in Bangladesh's first innings in Jamaica, but the tourists won the match by 101 runs to level the two-match series.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252001/west-indies-duo-fined-for-behaviour-in-bangladesh-loss
Govt urged to respond to Indian campaign strongly,"Major political parties on Wednesday suggested that the interim government should strongly address the Indian campaigns against Bangladesh. Their suggestion came at a dialogue with chief adviser to the interim government Muhammad Yunus held at the Foreign Service Academy in Dhaka city. Addressing the meeting, amid ongoing anti-Bangladesh propaganda in the Indian media, Yunus said that the entire world needed to know that Bangladesh remained united and what it achieved recently came through united efforts. The chief adviser sought suggestions from political parties enabling Bangladesh to proceed towards the right path without committing mistakes. In his opening remarks, Yunus said that an imaginary story was being spread about Bangladesh which was not limited to a single country, but was also circulated to other countries. Bangladesh by standing united must prove that story false and replace it with what is true, the chief adviser said. Commenting that many people did not apparently like the ‘new Bangladesh’, Yunus said that the government remained open for foreigners to come and see the situation on the ground. The chief adviser iterated the nation’s unity, noting that the campaigners against Bangladesh were powerful in resources and arrangements. After the meeting, law adviser Asif Nazrul while briefing reporters said that the key message of the meeting was that they would remain united to save the interest, sovereignty and existence of the country. ‘We will never deviate from this and there is no reason to think Bangladesh as powerless, weak and submissive. Bangladesh will remain united against any propaganda,’ the law adviser said. ‘We will uphold our unity,’ he said, adding that the entire nation remained united against India’s propaganda. Informing the media about the issues agreed upon in the meeting, he said that all participants in the dialogue in strongest terms condemned the attack on the Bangladesh assistant High Commission, anti-Bangladesh propaganda and India’s interference in Bangladesh’s internal affairs. The meeting praised the government’s self-respecting and courageous role against all these Indian steps, he said, adding that all the participants expressed firm solidarity with the government. At the same time, political parties urged the government to address the Indian propaganda in stronger terms and more quickly, he said, adding that they also suggested that the government should invite foreign friends, other friendly nations and international media outlets to visit Bangladesh. At the meeting, politicians also demanded that the government should make public all the agreements between Bangladesh and India done in the past 15 years. They also demanded the cancellation of all the harmful agreements, including the Rampal Power Plant, he added. ‘India’s economic oppression of Bangladesh, attempts to establish dominance, and interference in Bangladesh’s internal affairs have been condemned. The meeting made a call upon the outsiders to behave with dignity and good neighbourliness,’ he said. He said that finally, everyone present at the meeting stressed that no room would be allowed to think that Bangladesh was powerless, weak or kneeling. ‘We will remain united against any kind of propaganda and provocation. If any propaganda or provocation comes in the future, we will continue to make efforts to forge our unity even stronger,’ Asif Nazrul said. ‘The meeting also suggested a joint rally, a joint political council, a joint security council in this situation,’ he said. Having mentioned that despite fundamental difference in political views, paths, and ideals, the representatives of the political parties attending the dialogue vowed to stand united on the issue of national interest, sovereignty and existence, the adviser said. Later, BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain told reporters that the chief adviser had discussed with the political parties, seeking their cooperation to protect the national sovereignty. The independence that Bangladesh was won through the martyrdom of thousands of people, he said, adding that in this month of victory, they all vowed their conviction to stand beside the interim government in this situation, Khandaker Mosharraf added. ‘Their [the interim government] responsibility is to protect the independence, sovereignty and establish democracy in this country. Everyone must forge consensus against the fascist, fallen government that is conspiring against our country from abroad,’ he said. Stating that this conspiracy was an attempt to create division among the people of Bangladesh, the BNP leader said, ‘We have reached an agreement with the government that just as we, the people, dismissed the fascist government through a mass uprising in July-August, we, the students and people of this country, will jointly confront their conspiracy and those who are supporting them.’ Regarding the elections, he said that this government was committed to restoring the rights of the people. ‘Therefore, we suggested that the government should implement reforms very quickly and give a roadmap for the elections,’ he said. Commenting that no one would dare to conspire again once the election roadmap was published, he vowed, ‘We, the students and people will confront their conspiracy.’ Representatives from various political parties and alliances, including BNP, Bangladesh Jaamat-e-Islami, Ganatantra Mancha, 12-party alliance, Left Democratic Alliance, Bangladesh Jatiya Party, and Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh, were present in the dialogue. Liberal Democratic Party chairman Oli Ahmed, however, went to the Foreign Service Academy but could not join the dialogue as his name was not in the guest list. Earlier on Tuesday, Yunus held a meeting with the representatives of the Student Movement Against Discrimination at his official residence state guest house Jamuna. He is scheduled to hold a meeting with representatives of different religious groups on Thursday. On Tuesday, Bangladesh mission at Agartala in India was closed on security grounds, a day after it came under attack by a group of Indian protesters during a violent demonstration. While addressing the West Bengal Assembly on Monday, Mamata called for the deployment of UN peacekeepers and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s personal intervention to secure the safety of religious minorities in Bangladesh.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252000/govt-urged-to-respond-to-indian-campaign-strongly

"Maximum application fee of Tk 200 set for all govt jobs, including BCS","Application fees for all government jobs, including BCS and recruitment in banks and insurance companies have been capped at a maximum of Tk 200. This decision was taken during the secretary committee on Administrative Development meeting on Wednesday, said senior secretary of public administration ministry Md Mokhlesur Rahman. The notification for the reduction of fees will be issued within a week. The Bangladesh Public Service Commission would issue an order regarding the reduction of the application fee for BCS job seekers, he said. In addition, it was clarified that disabled applicants for BCS will no longer have to pay any extra amount beyond the set fee, in line with other applicants. ‘Earlier, the application fee for BCS in the PSC was Tk 700; they proposed Tk 350. However, today the secretary committee decided that it will be Tk 200. To apply for the 47th BCS at the PSC, Tk 200 will be required,’ said the senior secretary. ‘Another issue was that we thought this was low, but it is not low - for disabled applicants, there was a separate fee of Tk 100. It was proposed to reduce this to Tk 50. They would pay this additional amount on top of the fee (like other applicants), as a special arrangement for them. From today, this additional amount will not need to be paid. This is a flat rate: for the 47th BCS and any BCS application, the fee will be Tk 200,’ he added. Additionally, another order is being issued through the Finance Division, specifying that the application fee for jobs in banks, insurance companies, semi-government institutions, and entities referred to as extensions of the government will be capped at Tk 200. ‘Currently, there are many institutions in banks and insurance companies that charge application fees ranging from Tk 1,500 to Tk 2,000. For a job where only two people might get selected, perhaps 200 people apply, no one needs to pay Tk 1,000,’ Mokhlesur also said. ‘No application fee exceeding Tk 200 will be collected for government, semi-government, or extension of the government positions. This order will be issued by the Finance Division. Now, we are waiting for the notification order on this matter,’ he said. ‘We will also request in a letter from the Finance Division that private institutions try to follow this directive. This request could also be communicated by public administration ministry,’ he also added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251997/maximum-application-fee-of-tk-200-set-for-all-govt-jobs-including-bcs

"Trade with India through 3 land ports remain suspended, uninterrupted at Benapole","Export-import between India and Bangladesh through Sheola, Zakiganj and Tamabil land ports in Sylhet remained suspended since Sunday. Goods-laden trucks have been stranded on both sides due to the trade suspension, causing losses to traders. Sources at Zakiganj Customs Station said trade activities through Zakiganj land port remained halted since Sunday following demonstrations in India over the arrest of former ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das. On December 1, several hundred supporters of Chinmoy gathered at Sutarkandi Customs Station in India’s Karimganj following the arrest of the Hindu priest, disrupting trade activities at Zakiganj land port. Besides, trade was disrupted at Sutarkandi and Sheola land ports over the same issue. Atik Hussain, a former director of the Sylhet Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said the ISKCON-related unrest led to the suspension of export-import at Sutarkandi and Karimganj land ports in India. ‘No goods-laden vehicles could enter Bangladesh from India since the protests began,’ he added. As of Tuesday, around 200 goods-laden trucks were stranded at Sutarkandi land port in India, while another 50 remained stuck at Sheola land port in Bangladesh. Trucks carrying fruits and raw materials were also stranded at Karimganj land port, raising concerns about potential damage to perishable goods. Besides, trade activities through Tamabil land port in Sylhet, remained halted for several days following dispute in the measurement of stone and limestone products at the Dawki border in India. Over 300 trucks carrying stones and limestone remained stranded at Dawki land port in India, opposite to Tamabil Land Port, he said. UNB Benapole correspondent reported that the trade activities between Bangladesh and India were in the full swing. A total of 418 goods-laden trucks entered Bangladesh through Benapole port on Tuesday while 189 goods-laden trucks left for India through the land port. Besides, the passenger movement between the two countries through the land port also remained uninterrupted as some 1,800 passengers went to India on Wednesday. In Feni, some students and local people staged demonstrations at Bilonia land port in Parshuram upazila around 11:00am on Wednesday protesting against the attack on the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala of Tripura and ‘provocative statements’ made against Bangladesh over loudspeakers in the bordering area on Sunday. Additional police and members of Border Guard Bangladesh were deployed in the area on Wednesday to maintain law and order. On November 26, Chattogram Sixth Metropolitan Magistrate Judge Kazi Shariful Islam sent Chinmoy Das to jail rejecting his bail plea in a sedition case. Violence erupted on the court premises amid demonstrations by ISKCON supporters against the bail denial, leaving lawyer Saiful Islam Alif dead. Meanwhile, BGB stepped up vigil along the border to thwart any evil activities and unwanted situations along the bordering area amid growing tension over ex-ISKCON leader issue and attack on Bangladesh diplomatic mission in India’s Agartala.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251994/trade-with-india-through-3-land-ports-remain-suspended-uninterrupted-at-benapole

"FIFA to reveal Club World Cup draw amid apathy, legal threats","The draw for the expanded FIFA Club World Cup takes place in Miami on Thursday, offering a first glimpse into the fine detail of a tournament that has been viewed with indifference or even outright hostility across parts of the football world. Thirty-two star-studded club teams will battle it out in gleaming state-of-the-art arenas in what is effectively a curtain-raiser for the 2026 World Cup taking place a year later in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In theory, the new-look competition ought to be an enticing prospect that sells itself: a month-long football festival, the first large-scale club tournament to feature teams from all corners of the globe. Yet for many, FIFA president Gianni Infantino's passion project is a tournament too far, an unwelcome addition to an already crowded global calendar that exhausted players say has pushed them close to breaking point. The loudest antipathy towards the tournament, and FIFA, has come from Europe. In October, an umbrella grouping of top European leagues, together with the players' union, FIFPro, filed a legal complaint to the European Commission accusing FIFA of abusing its position over its handling of the international fixture calendar. Javier Tebas, the chief of Spain's La Liga, has been one of the Club World Cup's most outspoken critics, telling Infantino in October to cancel the tournament, citing apathy from broadcasters and opposition from clubs. ‘Mr President, you know you have not sold the broadcast rights for the Club World Cup, you know you have not sold any sponsorship rights,’ said Tebas. ‘Scrap the Club World Cup. It is not needed by the players, the clubs or FIFA.’ Players, meanwhile, have spoken of frustration at an ever-lengthening fixture schedule that leaves them with fewer opportunities for rest and recuperation. Manchester City and Spain star Rodri, the winner of this year's Ballon d'Or, warned in September that players were ‘close’ to striking over the calendar, citing the demands imposed by this season's expanded UEFA Champions League followed by the Club World Cup. ‘If it keeps this way we will have no other option,’ Rodri said of possible industrial action. ‘It is something that worries us.’ FIFA though has pushed back at the criticism forcefully, insisting that its calendar was approved by the FIFA Council following consultation from all continents including Europe as well as FIFPro and league bodies. The world football body also took aim at leagues in Europe who have opposed the tournament, accusing them of ‘acting with commercial self-interest and hypocrisy’ while preferring a calendar ‘filled with friendlies and summer tours.’ Infantino meanwhile has brushed off the criticism, insisting that the launch of the expanded club tournament will usher in a new era for world football. ‘The FIFA Club World Cup next year will bring the magic of a national team (FIFA) World Cup into the realm of club football, and this tournament will be the start of something historic, something that will change our sport for the better, and for future generations, who will come to love it as much as we do,’ Infantino said last month. Yet the opportunity to embrace the historic opportunity touted by FIFA has so far failed to excite broadcasters. FIFA, which is reportedly seeking $4 billion in media rights revenue for the tournament, has not confirmed a rights deal. The tournament itself will take place from June 15 to July 13, 2025, with the opening match hosted by Miami's Hard Rock Stadium and the final taking place at the MetLife Stadium in New York -- the venue for the 2026 World Cup final. Europe will provide the largest contingent of teams, with 12 sides including Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan taking part. South America will field six teams, with Africa, Asia and the CONCACAF region receiving four slots each. Oceania will be represented by New Zealand's Auckland City, while host nation the US has an additional slot, controversially awarded to Lionel Messi's Inter Miami despite the team being bundled out in the first round of the MLS Cup playoffs this year.

Van Nistelrooy off to winning start at Leicester,"Ruud van Nistelrooy savoured his first match in charge of Leicester with a 3-1 Premier League win over West Ham, while Crystal Palace edged Ipswich 1-0 on Tuesday. Jamie Vardy, Bilal El Khannouss and Patson Daka got the goals as Van Nistelrooy enjoyed a dream start to his new role shortly after his departure from Manchester United. ‘On a long-term basis we know the performances need to get better. But the spirit and how we want to do things we saw today because, if not, the Premier League is too brutal,’ said Van Nistelrooy. The Dutchman said he had been ‘astonished’ by the number of offers he received after a four-game spell as interim United boss, which included two wins over Leicester. A lethal finisher in his playing days, Van Nistelrooy watched on approvingly as Vardy opened the scoring after just 99 seconds at the King Power. The 37-year-old had initially been flagged offside, but a VAR review showed he was clearly on for his fifth goal of the season. Defeat ramps up the scrutiny of Hammers boss Julen Lopetegui after a seventh defeat in 14 Premier League games. The visitors enjoyed the majority of possession and had 31 shots to Leicester's eight but failed to make it count. ‘A frustrating night because we deserved much more today,’ said Lopetegui. ‘Normally we have to win this match but we didn't because we didn't score.’ West Ham did have a goal controversially ruled out when Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen punched the ball into his own net and was relieved to be awarded a foul due to minimal contact from Tomas Soucek. Conor Coady also cleared off the line from Crysencio Summerville in the second half. But Leicester remained a threat on the counter-attack and doubled their lead when El Khannouss coolly stroked home Kasey McAteer's pass. Daka then blasted in to make it 3-0 before Niclas Fuellkrug netted a late consolation with his first West Ham goal. Victory lifts Leicester up to 15th, four points above the relegation zone, and within two points of 14th-placed West Ham. Jean-Philippe Mateta scored the only goal at Portman Road as Palace won the battle of two more sides at the bottom end of the table. The Frenchman produced a classy finish from Eberechi Eze's pass on the hour mark to secure the Eagles' first away win of the season. Palace pull three points clear of the bottom three, while Ipswich remain second from bottom and winless at home on their return to the top flight. However, Palace captain Marc Guehi is now at risk of a suspension after defying a Football Association warning over displaying religious messages. As part of the ‘Rainbow Laces’ campaign to show support for the LGBTQ+ community, Premier League captains are wearing rainbow-coloured armbands. Guehi's armband bore the message ‘I love Jesus’ during their 1-1 draw against Newcastle, prompting the FA to contact Guehi and Palace and remind them of rules forbidding the display of religious messages. The England defender doubled down on his message with ‘Jesus loves you’ displayed on his rainbow-coloured armband. ‘Everyone now is about integration, no discrimination and Marc as well,’ said Palace boss Oliver Glasner. ‘He has his opinion and we accept and respect every opinion.’ Ipswich captain Sam Morsy, who also caused controversy by opting not to wear the rainbow armband against Nottingham Forest at the weekend, once again wore a regular armband. His club issued a statement on Monday saying he chose not to wear the rainbow armband due to his religious beliefs.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/251991/van-nistelrooy-off-to-winning-start-at-leicester
Leverkusen eliminate Bayern from German Cup,"Bayern Munich were dumped out of the German Cup by holders Bayer Leverkusen as Nathan Tella's second-half goal secured a 1-0 win for the Bundesliga champions on Tuesday, after Manuel Neuer saw the first red card of his 866-game career. The 38-year-old rushed out of the box in typical fashion 18 minutes in to the German Cup last-16 clash, taking out an advancing Jeremie Frimpong and seeing a straight red. Neuer's sending-off brought Israel goalkeeper Daniel Peretz on for his Bayern debut, 18 months after joining the club. Bayern, who were already without the injured Harry Kane, dug deep despite the one-man disadvantage and dominated the ball. The visitors eventually broke through in the 69th minute, though, with Tella heading in an Alex Grimaldo cross. Tella had only been on the field for eight minutes having come on for injured striker Patrik Schick, who himself was subbed on at half-time. Home winger Michael Olise lashed inches wide in the fourth minute of stoppage time but Leverkusen held on to inflict a first domestic defeat on Vincent Kompany since he became Bayern coach. ‘We were too hectic and tried to go forward too quickly,’ Leverkusen captain Jonathan Tah told ARD. ‘At half-time, we said we need to be patient -- and we did it. ‘I didn't know Nathan could be so good with his head.’ Neuer told reporters: ‘The red card decided the game. It hurt us and I'm sorry.’ Xabi Alonso's Leverkusen, who won an unbeaten league and cup double last season, are through to the last eight. Bayern have won the German Cup a record 20 times -- 14 more than the next best -- but have not made it past the quarter-finals since 2020, when they defeated Leverkusen 4-2 in the final. Elsewhere, a stoppage-time goal from Anthony Jung took Werder Bremen to the quarters with a 1-0 win over Darmstadt. Stuttgart are also through after a 3-0 win at Regensburg, while Freiburg were knocked out by a 3-1 loss at Arminia Bielefeld. Three-time winners Stuttgart were dominant against their second-division opponents, taking the lead just 10 minutes in thanks to a clever individual goal from Enzo Millot. Japanese defender Anrie Chase headed in from a free-kick nine minutes later to double the visitors' lead -- his first goal for Stuttgart. Nick Woltemade broke through and rounded the goalkeeper to score Stuttgart's third. Beaten finalists in 2022, Freiburg were heavy favourites to beat third-division Bielefeld and looked on course when Michael Gregoritsch won a penalty 15 minutes in, drawing a clumsy foul from Maximilian Grosser. But Florent Muslija's tame spot-kick was easily saved. The hosts then took the lead thanks to an excellent long-range effort from Christopher Lannert on 28 minutes, before Gregoritsch gave away a penalty, which was nervelessly converted by Julian Kania nine minutes before the break. Gregoritsch pulled one back just after the hour, but Louis Oppie put Bielefeld out of reach with a goal nine minutes from time. On Wednesday, RB Leipzig -- winners in 2022 and 2023 -- host five-time winners Eintracht Frankfurt. ",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251990/leverkusen-eliminate-bayern-from-german-cup-
Rahul ready to bat anywhere for India in second Test,"KL Rahul said Wednesday he will bat ‘wherever’ as India face a conundrum in the second Test against Australia with the expected return of Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill. The 54-Test veteran opened in the first Test at Perth, which India won by 295 runs, alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal in the absence of skipper Rohit, who stayed home for the birth of his second child. Number three Gill also missed the match with a thumb injury, but both are set to return for the day-night clash starting in Adelaide on Friday, leaving selectors with a headache. Rahul and Jaiswal shared a 201-run second innings opening partnership in Perth that proved pivotal in securing victory with both again set to pad-up. Devdutt Padikkal and Dhruv Jurel appear likely to make way for Rohit and Gill, but who bats where remains to be seen. ‘I've been told, but I've also been told not to share it,’ Rahul told reporters when asked if he knew what position he would be batting in Adelaide. ‘I just want to be in the playing XI. Fit me in wherever. I want to go out there and bat and play for the team. ‘Luckily for me I have batted in different positions,’ he added. ‘Whether I am batting top of the order or in the middle order, if I can manage the first 30-40 balls at start, everything then seems like regular batting, that's what I try to focus on.’ Rahul scored a patient 26 in the first innings in Perth then a solid 77 in the stand with Jaiswal, who slammed 161. While India head into the second match of the five-Test series full of confidence, they have less experience of pink ball cricket than Australia. And Adelaide has been a successful venue for the home side, who have won all seven day-night Tests they have played there, including against India in 2020-21 when the visitors were bundled out for 36.

Pakistan recall Babar Azam for South Africa tour,"Pakistan recalled former skipper Babar Azam on Wednesday for the away Test series and white-ball matches against South Africa starting next week, but there was no place for spinner Sajid Khan. The 30-year-old star batsman Azam was dropped following defeat in the first Test against England in October and rested for the ongoing limited-over series against Zimbabwe. Pakistan will play three Twenty20 internationals in South Africa starting from December 10, followed by three one-day matches and two Tests. Fast bowler Mohammad Abbas also returns to the Test side after last playing in 2021. Off-spinner Sajid misses out despite taking 19 wickets in the 2-1 home Test series win over England, with selectors taking into consideration the less spin-friendly pitches in South Africa. ‘We have adopted a horses for courses policy to ensure squads are well-balanced and leaving out Sajid was an extremely difficult decision,’ Aaqib Javed, a senior member of the selection committee, said in a Pakistan Cricket Board statement. Sajid's spin partner Noman Ali, who took 20 wickets against England, is the only spinner for the Tests in Centurion and Cape Town. The first Test starts on December 26. Javed said fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi has been picked only for the white-ball matches to manage his workload. Opener Fakhar Zaman is still out because he has yet to regain form and match fitness, said Javed. Pakistan squads for South Africa tour: Tests: Shan Masood (captain), Saud Shakeel, Aamer Jamal, Abdullah Shafique, Babar Azam, Haseebullah Khan, Kamran Ghulam, Khurram Shahzad, Mir Hamza, Mohammad Abbas, Mohammad Rizwan, Naseem Shah, Noman Ali, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha ODIs: Mohammad Rizwan (captain), Abdullah Shafique, Abrar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Haris Rauf, Kamran Ghulam, Mohammad Hasnain, Muhammad Irfan Khan, Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Sufiyan Muqeem, Tayyab Tahir, Usman Khan T20Is: Mohammad Rizwan (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Haris Rauf, Jahandad Khan, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Hasnain, Mohammad Irfan Khan, Omair Bin Yousuf, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Sufiyan Muqeem, Tayyab Tahir, Usman Khan",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251988/pakistan-recall-babar-azam-for-south-africa-tour
Harris Chy to be reburied with FF honour,"The High Court on Wednesday ordered the reburial of Harris Chowdhury, a former political secretary to Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson Khaleda Zia, at his preferred site with full honours as a freedom fighter. The decision follows DNA test results that confirmed the identity of his remains, dispelling lingering doubts about his death. The bench of Justice Fahmida Khatun and Justice Mubina Asaf issued the order after reviewing the DNA findings. Harris Chowdhury’s daughter, Samira Tanzin Chowdhury, filed a writ petition over the issue. The DNA test, conducted after the exhumation of a body buried under the alias ‘Mahmudur Rahman’ in Savar, conclusively matched Harris Chowdhury’s genetic profile with that of his daughter. His remains were exhumed on October 16, 2024, from the Jamia Khatamun Graveyard at Birulia in Savar, under court orders and tight security. His daughter Samira said, ‘The outgoing authoritarian regime fabricated confusion about my father’s death, and media reports perpetuated that uncertainty. As part of his family, this ambiguity has been deeply painful. The court’s intervention has finally allowed us to seek closure.’ Harris Chowdhury, who had reportedly gone into hiding to evade government persecution, passed away on September 3, 2021, at Evercare Hospital in Dhaka after contracting Covid-19. He was jailed for varying terms including one for life-term in two cases for murders and hurling explosives during the grenade attacks on an Awami League rally in the capital on August 21, 2004. According to the petitioner’s lawyer, Mahdin Chowdhury, Harris’ death was concealed under pressure from the then-government, and he was buried in a madrassah graveyard in Savar under the false identity of ‘Mahmudur Rahman.’ The government at the time neither issued a death certificate under his real name nor accorded him the recognition due as a freedom fighter. Media reports in September 2021 revealed Harris Chowdhury’s alleged secret burial. This disclosure sparked public speculation and led to inconsistent claims about his death, including rumours that he had passed away in London. Samira later clarified that her father had stayed in Bangladesh, living a life of religious devotion as an imam and preacher for the Tabligh. On September 5, 2024, the same High Court bench ordered the exhumation of the body for DNA testing in response to Samira’s writ petition. The test results, submitted to the court, conclusively identified the remains as those of Harris Chowdhury. Samira sought court intervention to end public harassment and provide her family with closure. ‘People still ask, ‘Did he really pass away?’ This uncertainty has been agonising for us,’ she said. Harris Chowdhury, a freedom fighter, had expressed his desire to be buried with due honour. The High Court’s decision enables his family to fulfil this wish, closing a painful chapter in their lives.

Increases in cigarette prices must exceed average rate of inflation : discussion,"Discussants at a workshop on Tuesday said as cigarette prices did not increase in alignment with the rate of inflation, this harmful product had been becoming increasingly affordable in Bangladesh. While average increase in the Consumer Price Index value over the past five fiscal years was 32 per cent, prices of different tier cigarettes had been increased by only 6 to 22 per cent, they mentioned at the workshop titled ‘Workshop on Cigarette Taxation with Media Professionals’ organised by Unnayan Shamannay at the Biswho Shahitta Kendro building in Dhaka, says a press release. They added that Bangladesh was failing to reduce smoking prevalence as desired and, therefore, in the budget for the next fiscal year (i.e., 2025-26), price increases of all tier cigarettes must be higher than the average rate of inflation. Representatives from 21 media houses participated in the workshop, while globally acclaimed mass-media professional Kamal Ahmed was present at the event as guest of honour. Unnayan Shamannay’s Research Director Abdullah Nadvi presented the concept note, where he pointed out that cigarette prices were not being raised adequately and effective taxes were not being imposed on these harmful products. Consequently, on the one hand- smoking prevalence was not coming down as required, and on the other hand- government was not getting due taxes from cigarette selling. He further added that between 2019-20 and 2023-24, the government could have earned additional Tk 66 billion per year in taxes if it had imposed effective taxes on cigarettes. Responding to a query from the participants, Kamal Ahmed said that significantly increasing cigarette prices to reduce affordability was among the most effective measures to reduce smoking prevalence. This had been proven in many countries across the globe. He added that Bangladesh must also go for significantly increasing cigarette prices and imposing effective taxes on those raised prices. He also urged the media professionals to highlight the need for effective cigarette taxation in the National Budget for the upcoming fiscal year (i.e., 2025-26). Representatives from the Daily Star, Daily Sun, the Asian Age, the Financial Express, the Business Standard, the New Age, Protidiner Bangladesh, Kalbela, Itttefaq, Jago News, Amader Shomoy, Bangla Vision, News 24, ATN Bangla, Ekhon TV, Shomoy TV, Views Bangla, Dhaka Mail, Bhorer Kagoj, Shomoy Journal, and Ganomukti participated in the event. Senior project coordinator of Unnayan Shamannay and member secretary of National Char Alliance- Zahid Rahman moderated the session. He expressed Unnayan Shamannay’s commitment to provide data and analytical support related to cigarette taxation for the media houses of the country.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251986/increases-in-cigarette-prices-must-exceed-average-rate-of-inflation-discussion
Yunus marks importance of combined efforts to overcome global challenges,"Highlighting the importance of ‘multilateral efforts’ to overcome the global challenges, chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus on Wednesday said that the global problem-solving must rely on cooperation, not conflicts. Addressing a graduation ceremony — National Defence Course-2024 —Yunus said that they needed to be together more than ever before as global challenges do not belong to anyone or any nation alone. Professor Yunus highly appreciated the members of the Bangladesh Armed Forces, noting that their commitment to safeguarding the nation has been exemplary. He said Bangladesh Armed Forces symbolises resilience, patriotism and unwavering dedication to peace and remembered their continuous efforts during national crises like disasters, political unrest and pandemics. ‘These demonstrate your unwavering dedication to the wellbeing of our citizens,’ said the chief adviser congratulating the NDC graduates from home and abroad. Besides, Professor Yunus said that their contributions to global peace through the United Nations are internationally acclaimed. He acknowledged Bangladesh Armed Forces’ enduring contributions to the national security, development and nation building activities. At the beginning, the chief adviser remembered with great pride the legacy of all who laid down their lives during the War of Liberation in 1971 and sacrifices made by the people of all walks of life during the struggle. ‘This is a very special month, month of December.’ He also paid tributes to all who sacrificed their lives and got wounded to make the July revolution possible with a dream to create a new Bangladesh. Professor Yunus told the members of the NDC that as they look ahead, he is confident that NDC will continue to uphold its motto, security through knowledge. To international course members, he said, ‘I trust you will act as goodwill ambassadors for Bangladesh in your respective countries and beyond the borders of your countries.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/251985/yunus-marks-importance-of-combined-efforts-to-overcome-global-challenges
Indian foreign secy to come to visit Dhaka on Dec 10,"Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri is likely to be in Dhaka on December 10 as both Bangladesh and India are preparing for a high-level foreign secretary-level meeting next week. Once finalised, this is going to be the first visit to be paid by a senior Indian government official to Bangladesh since the interim government, led by Nobel laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus, came to power on August 8, a diplomatic source told UNB on Wednesday. However, there has been no official announcement yet regarding his visit to hold the Foreign Office Consultations with Bangladesh foreign secretary Md Jashim Uddin. Asked whether the scheduled Foreign Office Consultations will be held this month, foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said, ‘I think it will be held.’ The discussion is likely to cover a range of bilateral issues, including the potential extradition of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who is currently in India and visa issues. At the foreign ministry’s weekly briefing on November 21, director general of the Public Diplomacy Wing Toufique Hasan confirmed that an inter-ministerial meeting has already taken place to coordinate preparations for the upcoming talks. ‘There is a scope for discussion on the matter (extradition of Sheikh Hasina),’ Hasan said at a weekly media briefing. Sheikh Hasina, who fled Dhaka on August 5 and has been residing in India since then, is facing trial in Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal for alleged involvement in mass killings during the July-August uprising. While the government intends to bring her back, Hasan emphasised that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not yet received any formal directive to initiate the extradition process. ‘We will engage with Delhi and begin the formal process in accordance with the existing extradition treaty once we receive the necessary instructions,’ he clarified in response to queries. Regarding the review of existing agreements and memorandums of understanding between the two countries, Hasan said that these fall under the jurisdiction of various ministries in Bangladesh.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/251984/indian-foreign-secy-to-come-to-visit-dhaka-on-dec-10
Adviser Mahfuj seeks UK support to bring back laundered money,"Bangladesh interim government adviser Mahfuj Alam on Wednesday sought the support of the United Kingdom to bring back the laundered money from Bangladesh and run the economy that was left in fragile condition by the past autocratic regime, says a press release. ‘Laundered money has gone from our land to your land. We want that money back to run our economy,’ Mahfuj told Sarah Cooke, the British High Commissioner to Bangladesh, when the latter called on him at his office in Tejgaon, Dhaka. Mahfuj explained to the High Commissioner the efforts of the government to create a national consensus on various issues, including the election process. ‘It’s our revolution, and we have to protect it,’ he said. ‘The ideals of the July Revolution were basically dignity. Bangladeshi people did not have dignity for many years. So, they have kind of an emotional attachment to this revolution,’ he said. They also fought for equality and justice. High Commissioner Cooke highlighted the challenge ahead of the Interim Government and the UK support to the Interim Government’s work to create a pathway to an inclusive democratic future in Bangladesh. Mahfuj raised the issue of a fresh travel alert that drew widespread attention on Tuesday. High Commissioner Cooke cited a Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office report to assure the adviser that the UK constantly reviews travel advice for each country to ensure it includes up to date information and advice on the most relevant issues for British people visiting or living here.

700 inmates still in hiding after jailbreaks: IG Prisons,"The jail authorities on Wednesday said that 700 inmates, out of 2,200 who fled breaking jails before and after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government in August, were still roaming outside while the rest of the inmates either surrendered or were arrested by law enforcement agencies. ‘Over 2,200 inmates fled from several jails during the student-led mass uprising and after the fall of the then government on August 5. Of them, 1500 people were arrested. Now, 700 of them are still out of jails,’ inspector general of prisons Brigadier General Syed Md Motaher Hossain made the disclosure at a press conference at the Prisons Directorate in the city over the directorate’s past three-month activities. He said that 70, including extremists and death-row convicts were in hiding. ‘A total of 174 people such as Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh, death-row convicts and other criminals walked out of jails after securing bail. Of them, 11 were top listed criminals,’ said Motaher. The IG Prisons said that 17 jails, out of 69, were in dilapidated conditions across the country. Responding to a question over harassing a former AL minister and a lawmaker at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Motaher said that prison guards were present during the incident and took immediate actions and that was why the incident did not get worse. ‘I can surely say that there is a lack of security. The Prisons Directorate is looking into the matter so that such incidents could not take place in future,’ he added. On July 19, 826 inmates fled after breaking Narsigndi district jail and looted arms. Asked about the action over the incident, he said that the Narsigndi jailor was suspended after the incident. ‘We will take necessary actions against those responsible,’ the official said. In his written speech, Motaher said that the directorate had taken initiatives to change the logo of the Prisons Directorate following the demand of different quarters as the logo had a boat symbol and other complexities. He said that there was no scope for special prisoners to use mobile phones as they had set up mobile jammers and all-time CCTV surveillance in the area. He also said that facilities the special prisoners were receiving included a bed, a chair, a table, newspapers and some others but it would not be called a luxury lifestyle. Responding to a question about taking actions against jail officials, Motaher said that four prison officials were sent to forced retirement for allegations of corruption and irregularities. ‘We are investigating some other allegations. We will also take actions against those officials after the probe,’ he added. Additional IG Prisons Colonel Sheikh Sujaur Rahman, deputy inspector general of Prisons Headquarters Monir Ahmed, AIG Prisons for administration Abu Taleb and AIG Prisons for development Jannat Ul Forhad, among others, were present at the press conference.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251981/700-inmates-still-in-hiding-after-jailbreaks-ig-prisons-
United States appreciates Bangladesh’s effort to ensure security for all,"The United States has welcomed the ongoing efforts of Bangladesh’s interim government to ensure the safety and security of all citizens. A spokesperson for the US Department of State made this statement in response to a question from Voice of America Bangla on Tuesday, December 3. Addressing concerns about alleged inaction by the interim government regarding the safety of minority communities, the State Department noted via an emailed response: ‘We condemn any acts of violence or intolerance towards members of minority communities and welcome the interim government’s continued efforts to ensure the security of all citizens in Bangladesh.’ When asked about the US position on alleged persecution of minority communities in Bangladesh, the Department further stated: ‘The United States supports freedom of religion or belief, freedom of expression, and the rights to peaceful assembly and association as fundamental freedoms. We consistently communicate our support for these rights to the interim government of Bangladesh and our other partners.’ The US State Department also addressed concerns surrounding the designation of ISKCON as a ‘terrorist organisation’ in Bangladesh and the ongoing legal troubles of Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari. The spokesperson noted — ‘These issues should be resolved by the government of Bangladesh in line with the rights guaranteed by its constitution and laws. We urge Bangladesh, as we do all countries, to uphold freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, association, and religion or belief.’ Tensions have risen between Bangladesh and India over the arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das and the reported persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh.

"Thousands march in S Korea, ask president to quit","Thousands of protesters marched on president Yoon Suk Yeol’s office in the South Korean capital Wednesday evening, joining a push by the country’s opposition to impeach the leader after his extraordinary but short-lived imposition of martial law. Yoon’s shock bid to suspend civilian rule for the first time in over four decades — before being overturned by lawmakers in a night of drama — plunged South Korea into deep turmoil and alarmed its close allies. The future of Yoon, a conservative politician and former star public prosecutor who was elected president in 2022, is now highly uncertain. Live feed video showed thousands of protesters marching towards Yoon’s office in central Seoul after staging a rally in Gwanghwamun Square. South Korea’s opposition parties — whose lawmakers jumped fences and tussled with security forces to vote down the martial law — filed a motion to impeach Yoon. They were yet to decide when to put it to a vote, but it could come as soon as Friday. The opposition holds a large majority in the 300-member parliament and needs only a handful of defections from the president’s party to secure the two-thirds majority needed to pass the motion. The DP has also filed charges of ‘insurrection’ against the president, some of his ministers and top military and police officials — which can carry a penalty of life imprisonment or even death. The nation’s largest umbrella labour union called an ‘indefinite general strike’ until Yoon resigns. Even the leader of Yoon’s own ruling party described the attempt as ‘tragic’ while calling for those involved to be held accountable. Seoul’s stock exchange closed down more than one per cent Wednesday as markets were roiled by the turmoil. In his late-night television announcement, Yoon declared martial law, citing the threat of North Korea and ‘anti-state forces’. More than 280 troops, some flown in by helicopters, arrived at parliament to lock down the site. But 190 lawmakers defied rifle-carrying soldiers to force their way into parliament to vote against the move. This left Yoon with no choice but to retract his decision and call off the military in another television address six hours later. Under the constitution, martial law must be lifted when a majority in parliament demands it. Senior aides working for Yoon offered Wednesday to resign en masse over the martial law declaration. Yoon’s defence minister also offered to step down, saying he took ‘full responsibility for the confusion and concern’ around the martial law declaration. By evening, Yoon had yet to publicly reappear. The repeal of martial law prompted jubilation among flag-waving protesters outside parliament who had braved freezing temperatures to keep vigil through the night in defiance of Yoon’s order. Demonstrator Lim Myeong-pan, 55, said that Yoon now has to go. ‘Yoon’s act of imposing it in the first place without legitimate cause is a serious crime in itself,’ Lim said. ‘He has paved his own path to impeachment with this.’ As night fell in Seoul, protesters gathered again, ramping up their calls for Yoon to go. ‘I was so incensed I couldn’t sleep a wink last night, I came out to make sure we push out Yoon once and for all,’ 50-year-old Kim Min-ho said at a demonstration at the assembly Wednesday. Yoon had said that his imposition of martial law was to ‘safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea’s communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people’s freedom and happiness’. Yoon did not elaborate on the North’s threats, but the South remains technically at war with nuclear-armed Pyongyang. The president labelled the main opposition Democratic Party ‘anti-state forces intent on overthrowing the regime’. In recent weeks, Yoon and his People Power Party have been bitterly at odds with the opposition over next year’s budget. His approval rating dropped to 19 per cent in the latest Gallup poll last week, with voters angry at the state of the economy as well as controversies involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee. Yoon’s action took allies by surprise, with the United States, which has nearly 30,000 troops in the country to protect it from the nuclear-armed North, saying it had no prior notice and voicing relief at his reversal. ‘This is a surprising last-ditch move by Yoon to grab political power,’ Gi-Wook Shin, a sociology professor at Stanford University, said. ‘This move will only fasten the demise of his political career as it is likely to lead to his impeachment.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/251976/thousands-march-in-s-korea-ask-president-to-quit
Dhaka becomes most polluted city with AQI score of 259,"Dhaka, the overcrowded capital of Bangladesh, has topped the list of cities worldwide with the worst air quality with an AQI score of 259 at 9:00 am on Wednesday. Dhaka’s air was classified as ‘very unhealthy’, according to the air quality and pollution city ranking. An AQI between 151 and 200 is considered ‘unhealthy’ while 201-300 is ‘very unhealthy’, and 301-400 is considered ‘hazardous’, posing severe health risks to residents.Egypt’s Cairo, Iraq’s Baghdad and Uganda’s Kampala occupied the second, third and fourth spots in the list, with AQI scores of 241, 189 and 187, respectively. The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. The AQI in Bangladesh is based on five pollutants: particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251975/dhaka-becomes-most-polluted-city-with-aqi-score-of-259
Taijul spins Bangladesh to win over Windies,"Taijul Islam snared five wickets for the 15th time in a Test innings to lead Bangladesh to a series-levelling 101-run victory over the West Indies on the fourth evening of the second and final Test at Sabina Park on Tuesday. After Jaker Ali's Test-best innings of 91 lifted the tourists to 268 all out in their second innings and left the home team with a daunting victory target of 287, left-arm spinner Islam broke the back of the Caribbean side's effort with five for 50 as they were dismissed for 185 in the day's final session. Fast bowler Nahid Rana, whose maiden five-wicket haul in the first innings pulled Bangladesh back into contention, had the satisfaction of administering the final rites when he yorked last man Shamar Joseph for his only wicket of the innings. ‘It's a great feeling to win a Test match abroad which we don't often do and all the boys really put in a tremendous effort,’ said player-of-the-match Islam. Seamers Taskin Ahmed and Hasan Mahmud took two wickets each with Taskin emerging as the leading wicket-taker in the brief series with 11 victims to his name. Kavem Hodge topscored for the West Indies with 55, while captain Kraigg Brathwaite played with unusual adventure at the top of the order in contributing 43 off 63 deliveries. But they lost wickets at regular intervals and eventually succumbed in just 50 overs as Bangladesh swiftly avenged the 201-run mauling they endured in the first Test in Antigua a week earlier. ‘We wanted to be positive and I thought we started well but obviously we couldn't carry it through to the end of the day,’ said a rueful Brathwaite. This was Bangladesh's first Test victory in the West Indies since their 2-0 sweep over a depleted Caribbean side in 2009. Earlier Ali's belligerent innings, which occupied 106 deliveries and was embellished by eight fours and five sixes, tilted the balance heavily in favour of Bangladesh as the highest successful run-chase in a Test at Sabina Park was the 212 achieved by the West Indies over Sri Lanka in 2003. Such was the extent of the 26-year-old right-hander's dominance of the morning that he contributed 62 of the 75 runs added by the tourists after resuming at the overnight position of 193-5. Alzarri Joseph and Kemar Roach took three wickets each for the West Indies, Joseph ending Ali's quest for a maiden Test hundred when he was last out, caught at deep midwicket a half-hour before lunch.

Barca hit five as they return to winning ways at Mallorca,"Raphinha and Lamine Yamal inspired Barcelona to a first win in four La Liga outings as they beat Mallorca 5-1 on Tuesday. The comprehensive victory brings the Catalans to 37 points at the top of the league table, four ahead of second-placed Real Madrid, but with two extra matches played. Carlo Ancelotti's Spanish and European champions will have the chance to cut that lead back to one point on Wednesday when they travel to Athletic Bilbao. Mallorca stay sixth in La Liga, still two points behind Athletic Bilbao in the final Champions League spot. Ferran Torres gave Barcelona the lead, before Vedat Muriqi equalised to ensure the sides were level at half-time. Raphinha and Yamal lit up the second half as the away side ran riot with the Brazilian scoring a double, followed by strikes from Frenkie de Jong and Pau Victor. Barcelona were boosted by the return of teenage starlet Yamal, who started the match after recovering from an ankle problem. Hansi Flick's side dropped points in the two league outings Yamal missed, and were also defeated last time out at home to lowly Las Palmas when he was only fit enough to start on the bench. The hosts gifted Barca the lead in the 12th minute when panicked defending resulted in Torres being presented with a golden opportunity when there seemed to be no danger. As a trio of Majorcan defenders shepherded the ball back to their goalkeeper, full-back Johan Mojica suddenly decided to try to lash it away, only to smash the ball straight into Antonio Raillo and it fell perfectly to the feet of the Barcelona forward, who duly stroked home the opener. The Catalans' high defensive line caught Mallorca out on several occasions as they tried to spring their attackers with passes over the top. Mallorca were, however, starting to build pressure on Barcelona, though the visitors remained dangerous on the counter with their fleet-footed attacking quartet of Yamal, Dani Olmo, Raphinha and Torres. A second goal in the match did not seem far away, for either side, and it came for the hosts in the 43rd minute. Inigo Martinez was deeper than the rest of the Barcelona line and Pablo Maffeo timed his run onto Sergi Darder's pass to perfection, before rolling the ball across to Muriqi to tap into an open net. Another defensive lapse nearly restored the visitors' lead on the stroke of half-time, but goalkeeper Leo Roman bailed out Raillo for his poor back-header by denying Raphinha one-on-one. The Mallorca 'keeper thwarted the Brazilian again early in the second period, punching away a fizzing free-kick from close range. But it was eventually third time lucky for Raphinha in his duel with Roman as he flashed a 56th-minute penalty just beyond the Spaniard's reach. The sheer pace of the returning Yamal had earned the spot-kick as he raced onto Olmo's through-ball, before being brought down by Mojica inside the box. Barcelona struggled recently in Yamal's absence, and the 17-year-old displayed his brilliance again moments later when an inspired backheel created a chance out of nothing, until Pedri's snapshot was blocked. Raphinha made the game safe for Barcelona with 14 minutes remaining when he latched onto a magnificent outside-of-the-foot cross courtesy of Yamal. The Euro 2024 winner repeated the trick five minute later, this time finding the forward run of Victor, whose pass across goal was cut out, but only as far as the onrushing De Jong who finished unerringly. De Jong then turned provider in the final 10 minutes as he squared for 23-year-old substitute Victor to score. Yamal could have capped off a superb second-half showing but his dinked finish near the end was well saved by the defiant Roman.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/251973/barca-hit-five-as-they-return-to-winning-ways-at-mallorca

Matarbari plant to generate 1200MW from Friday,"Matarbari Ultra Super Critical Coal Fired Power Plant will go for 1200MW electricity generation from Friday, as coal is imported for power generation. ‘We have ensured coal supply for the plant to keep it operation for electricity generation,’ AJM Ershad Ahsan Habib, director general (additional charge) of Power Cell told media on Tuesday. He said that Matarbari Ultra Super Critical Coal Fired Power Plant was under maintenance then and it would go for operation from Friday. ‘From now coal crisis will not be visible, as coal is coming in every week. Each unit of the plant, having 600MW generation capacity, is required 5000 metric tonnes of coal per day while 5000 metric tonnes for another unit,’ he added. Habib said that workers of the power plant had been unloading coal from mother vessel within 2-3 days instead of 10-15 days. He said that the country generated 10,000 MW power on Monday as electricity demand was gradually decreasing due to winter season. According to information, the 1,200 MW two-unit power plant was shut down from October 31 due to coal shortage. A ship bearing the Indonesian flag arrived at the jetty of the power plant with 70,000 metric tonnes of coal last week. Apart from this, another ship from Indonesian ship with 60,000 metric tonnes of coal arrived at Matarbari power. Manowar Hossain Majumdar, supervising engineer (transportation) of Matarbari Site Office of Coal Power Generation Company Bangladesh Limited, told journalists recently that an agreement was signed for coal import.

Vietnam property tycoon on death row awaits appeal verdict,"A Vietnamese property tycoon sentenced to death in a multi-billion-dollar fraud case arrived in court on Tuesday, as she awaits the verdict of her appeal in one of the biggest corruption prosecutions in history. Property developer Truong My Lan, 68, was convicted earlier this year of embezzling money from Saigon Commercial Bank — which prosecutors said she controlled — and condemned to die for fraud totalling $27 billion. In her official handwritten appeal of more than five pages seen by AFP, Lan said the death sentence was ‘too severe and harsh’, asking the court to consider a more ‘lenient and humane approach’. On Tuesday, Lan sat in the front row of the courtroom, waiting to hear if her life would be spared. Next to her was her husband, who is appealing a nine-year sentence for violating banking regulations. The month-long appeal was attended by more 100 lawyers, according to state media. Tens of thousands of people who invested their savings in SCB lost money, shocking the communist nation and prompting rare protests from the victims. According to Vietnamese law, Lan could escape the death penalty if she proactively returns three-quarters of the embezzled assets and is judged to have cooperated sufficiently with authorities. But prosecutors have argued she has not met the conditions, and emphasised her crime’s consequences were ‘huge and without precedent’. Lan, who founded real estate development group Van Thinh Phat, told the court in Ho Chi Minh City ‘the quickest way’ to repay the stolen funds would be ‘to liquidate SCB, and sell our assets to repay State Bank of Vietnam and the people’. ‘I feel pained due to the waste of national resources,’ Lan said last week, adding she felt ‘very embarrassed to be charged with this crime’. Lan owned just five per cent of shares in SCB on paper, but at her trial, the court concluded that she effectively controlled more than 90 per cent through family, friends and staff. The State Bank said in April that it pumped funds into SCB to stabilise it, without revealing how much. Among the assets that Lan and Van Thinh Phat own are a shopping mall, a harbour and luxurious housing complexes in business hub Ho Chi Minh City. During her first trial in April, Lan was found guilty of embezzling $12.5 billion, but prosecutors said the total damages caused by the scam amounted to $27 billion — equivalent to around six per cent of the country’s 2023 GDP. Lan and dozens of defendants, including senior central bank officials were arrested as part of a national corruption crackdown dubbed the ‘burning furnace’ that has swept up numerous officials and members of Vietnam’s business elite. A total of 47 other defendants have requested reduced sentences at the appeal. Last month, Lan was convicted of money laundering and jailed for life in a separate case.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/251967/vietnam-property-tycoon-on-death-row-awaits-appeal-verdict
Ukraine pushes NATO for invite as Trump looms,"Ukraine insisted Tuesday that NATO membership was the only ‘real guarantee’ for its security as foreign ministers from the alliance looked set to rebuff Kyiv’s push for an invite ahead of Donald Trump’s return to the US presidency. Trump has vowed to press for a quick deal to end Russia’s war, leaving Kyiv scrambling to position itself ahead of his January inauguration. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky has said getting security guarantees from the Western alliance and supplies of key weaponry are prerequisites for Kyiv to start talking about halting its fight. ‘We are convinced that the only real guarantee of security for Ukraine, as well as a deterrent to further Russian aggression against Ukraine and other states, is Ukraine’s full membership in NATO,’ the foreign ministry in Kyiv said. Zelensky said Sunday that Kyiv was hoping NATO foreign ministers meeting in Brussels with Ukraine’s top diplomat would issue ‘recommendations’ to grant his country a membership invitation. ‘But we have no illusions — there are some sceptical countries,’ he said. Until now, the leaders of NATO heavyweights the United States and Germany have backed away from Ukrainian membership out of fear it could drag the alliance into a war with Russia. Diplomats said that with the administration of US president Joe Biden on its way out and Germany chancellor Olaf Scholz’s future in doubt ahead of elections, Kyiv hoped their foreign ministers could have more leeway. But US officials in private say the Biden administration will not back Ukraine’s push as they believe any offer would be rescinded by the president-elect. NATO secretary general Mark Rutte pushed away questions over Ukraine’s possible membership and how it could play into any peace deal, saying the alliance needed to ‘concentrate’ on getting more weapons to Kyiv. ‘I would now argue that Ukraine doesn’t need more ideas on what a peace process could look like,’ Rutte said. ‘Make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to get to a position of strength when those peace talks start.’ Trump has said he could end Russia’s war in Ukraine in a matter of hours, but has given no details on how he intends to achieve that goal. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned against any moves to place Ukraine under NATO’s security umbrella. ‘Such a potential decision is unacceptable to us,’ Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Trump’s new envoy on the Ukraine war, Keith Kellogg, has floated shelving Ukraine’s longstanding NATO ambitions as part of a peace deal — while still providing Kyiv security guarantees. Rutte warned the incoming US administration that if Ukraine got a ‘bad deal’ it risked emboldening American rivals such as China and North Korea. ‘Whenever we get to a deal on Ukraine, it has to be a good deal,’ he said. While moving Ukraine closer to the alliance appears unlikely right now, two Western diplomats said initial discussions had begun on whether European troops could be deployed to enforce any eventual ceasefire. ‘In many countries, there is very serious thinking on various possible scenarios and how we can contribute to security guarantees,’ a European diplomat said. ‘We need to be able to have an idea to communicate to the US.’ As Ukraine presses on the diplomatic side, its forces are buckling across the eastern front in the face of Russia’s grinding offensive. Russia said Tuesday that it had captured two more southeastern villages, while Ukraine said it had repelled a push across a key river. Kyiv is looking to wring all the weaponry it can from the Biden administration amid fears Trump will cut aid. Washington on Monday announced an additional $725 million military aid package for Ukraine. Kyiv has called on allies to provide air defence systems capable of shooting down the new Oreshnik experimental ballistic missile fired by Moscow. Those include the American Terminal High Altitude Area Defence system and the Arrow system developed by Israel and the US, officials said. NATO diplomats said they doubted Washington would move quickly to provide Ukraine the new systems, given how long it took Biden to give the green light on delivering less-modern Patriot defences.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/251966/ukraine-pushes-nato-for-invite-as-trump-looms
Saudi Arabia surpasses 300 executions in 2024,"Saudi Arabia has put over 300 people to death in 2024, according to an AFP tally, after four executions announced on Tuesday brought the kingdom’s total to a level far outstripping the highest known annual figures. The death penalty was carried out against three people convicted of drug smuggling and another for murder, the official Saudi Press Agency reported, citing the interior ministry. It brings the total number of executions for the year to 303, according to the tally based on state media reports. The Gulf monarchy had enacted the death penalty 200 times by the end of September, according to the same tally of official data, indicating a rapid rate of executions in recent weeks. Saudi Arabia executed the third highest number of prisoners in the world in 2023 after China and Iran, according to Amnesty International. Previously the record number of executions in a single year in the country had stood at 196 in 2022, said the London-based human rights group, which began recording the annual figures in 1990. Taha al-Hajji, legal director of the Berlin-based European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, condemned the ‘rocket speed’ of executions in 2024, calling it ‘incomprehensible and inexplicable’.

None stood for Chinmoy in court,"The bail application of Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, spokesperson of the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote, has been rescheduled for a hearing on January 2. The court fixed the new date after no defence lawyer appeared on his behalf on Tuesday. Chattogram Metropolitan Sessions Judge Saiful Islam issued the order on Tuesday morning, said Nesar Ahmed, Nazir of the Metropolitan Sessions Judge Court. Nesar said that the bail hearing had initially been slated for Tuesday. While the prosecution team was fully present, no lawyer representing the accused appeared in court. As a result, the hearing was deferred to January 2 upon the prosecution’s request. In the meantime, security around the court premises and adjacent areas has been significantly tightened. Vehicular movement was restricted, with only private vehicles allowed entry after thorough checks. Members of the police, army, and Rapid Action Battalion were deployed at key checkpoints to maintain order. However, Chinmoy Krishna Das was not brought before the court on the day. Meanwhile, a group of lawyers has warned of continuing their movement if Chinmoy Krishna Das is not shown arrested in connection with the murder of lawyer Saiful Islam Alif. The protest began at 10:45am on Tuesday at the Chattogram court premises, where the lawyers issued their ultimatum during a rally condemning Alif’s killing. Addressing the gathering, the lawyers said, ‘Chinmoy Krishna Das has yet to be shown arrested in the Saiful Islam Alif murder case. We demand his immediate arrest in connection with the case. Otherwise, our movement will continue. We also strongly condemn the attack on the Bangladesh high commission in Agartala and the burning of the Bangladesh flag.’ Earlier, the Chattogram District Bar Association gave a directive discouraging lawyers from representing the accused. The association’s leaders also demanded that Chinmoy Krishna Das be accused in all related cases. Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote in a statement on Sunday claimed that 70 Hindu lawyers had been named as defendants in the case filed by Alif’s brother, Khane Alam. The organisation alleged that the move was intended to obstruct the bail hearing of Chinmoy Krishna Das. On November 26, the Sixth Metropolitan Magistrate Court of Chattogram rejected Chinmoy’s bail in a sedition case and ordered him to be sent to jail. Saiful Islam Alif, a Chattogram court assistant public prosecutor, was stabbed indiscriminately in the head and neck during the clash between law enforcement agencies and followers of Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, a former ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) leader, on the day. Five cases were filed so far over Saiful Islam Alif’s killing near court premises and vandalism and other offences. The police have filed three of the cases and victim families filed the rest two, while 38 people, including nine, have been arrested in connection with Saiful killing. Four days after the lawyer had been hacked to death, victim’s father Jamal Uddin filed a murder case with the Kotwali police against 31 named and 10-15 unidentified people on Saturday. Saiful’s elder brother Khane Alam filed another case with the same police over attacks and vandalism perpetrated on a Chattogram court premises against 116 named individuals and 400–500 unnamed people.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251961/none-stood-for-chinmoy-in-court
Tarique for utmost restraint,"The Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting chairman, Tarique Rahman, on Tuesday urged Bangladeshis to show utmost restraint and not fall prey to any provocation amid the tension between Bangladesh and India. ‘Since the fall of autocrat Sheikh Hasina, there is an increase of inflammatory media commentary and political rhetoric against Bangladesh coming from certain Indian quarters,’ he said in a post from his verified social media handle (X and Facebook). The BNP leader’s remarks came a day after the attack on the Bangladesh mission in Agartala, the capital city of the Indian state of Agartala, and West Bengal chief minister’s remarks asking her country’s prime minister Narendra Modi’s intervention and deployment of UN peacekeepers for the safety and security of minorities in Bangladesh. Tarique expressed concern that there was now an echo chamber filled with misinformation, fuelling persistent anti-Bangladesh sentiment. ‘The latest attack on the Bangladeshi consulate in Agartala highlights the destabilising effects of disinformation, which only creates division and discord among neighbours,’ he said. He also said that international stakeholders must acknowledge that a destabilised Bangladesh, with nearly 200 million people, is not in the interest of any country. ‘It is crucial to objectively understand what led to Hasina’s ouster, what has been happening in Bangladesh since she fled to India, and why it’s imperative to forge people-to-people ties between Bangladesh and India, beyond any particular person or political party,’ he added. The BNP acting chairman said, ‘Bangladesh faces many challenges, but we have largely been, and will remain, a land of religious harmony and territorial sovereignty, where the rights and freedoms of every citizen are protected, irrespective of race, caste, and religion.’ The party secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgur, in a statement on Tuesday strongly condemned the attack on the premises of the Bangladesh mission in Agartala. ‘The attack on the premises of the Assistant High Commission by the members of an organisation called Hindu Sangharsh Samiti is believed to be pre-planned. Entering the premises of the Assistant High Commission, taking down the Bangladesh flag, setting it on fire and vandalising it is a clear violation of the Geneva Convention,’ he said. ‘We would like to request the Indian government and people that the use of hatred in Bangladesh as a tactic of your internal politics will create long-term tension in the relations between the two countries,’ he said. ‘We hope that the Indians will respect the democratic aspirations of the citizens of new Bangladesh and will help in bringing the leaders of the past fascist Awami regime, who are now in India, back to Bangladesh and bringing them to justice,’ he said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/251960/tarique-for-utmost-restraint

The platform, which led the student-people movement in July and August, made the remark following a meeting with the chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus. Yunus organised the meeting as part of a series of dialogue on establishing national unity while he is scheduled to sit with major political parties and religious leaders on Wednesday. After the meeting, students’ movement convener Hasnat Abdullah said that India sees Bangladesh through the eyes of Awami League. ‘On the basis of national unity, the Awami government fell on August 5. We must hold on to that unity. India must spread correct information instead of misinformation,’ he said. He said that as many uneven agreements have reportedly been made, there has been a demand to disclose all the secret agreements with India. At the same time, it has been demanded to publish the information of all killings at the borders, including Felani Khatun who was gunned down by the Indian Border Security Force in January 7, 2011. Hasnat said that India was spreading the poison of communalism. ‘The Student Movement Against Discrimination will cooperate with the interim government in the need of national unity,’ he said. Earlier on the day, at a press conference at Foreign Service Academy, chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam said that Muhammad Yunus has begun dialogues with student leaders, politicians and religious leaders to call for a national unity. Accordingly, the chief adviser on Tuesday held a meeting with student leaders, he said, adding that Prof Yunus has invited the leaders of major political parties on Wednesday to take part in the dialogue. ‘The main aim of the two meetings is forging national unity. He will call for national unity,’ Alam added. He said that the chief adviser was holding a meeting with the student leaders on Tuesday evening at the state guest house Jamuna. About the importance of the national unity, the press secretary said the unity is very important now as the Indian media is deliberately carrying out a misinformation campaign against Bangladesh. ‘We must resist the misinformation campaign unitedly,’ he added. He said, many media, especially Indian ones, are spreading misinformation. National unity is very important in this context. ‘We will put the blame on the Indian media. They are spreading news without verifying it, due to which the Indian people are getting angry. The Indian media is trying to put our nation on the shelf,’ he said, adding that the government has spoken to many renowned media outlets around the world, but the Indian media is spreading pre-determined reports. Alam said that Professor Yunus had a conversation with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi at the end of August and, at that time, the chief advisor had requested the Indian prime minister to send a representative to visit the ground. ‘We have repeatedly given information from our side. They are taking information from their preferred sources. We want to tell everything openly in all cases. But if you close your eyes, ears and nose, you will not know the truth. India is pretending not to hear it,’ he said. However, these rumours and false information are being dealt with according to diplomatic procedures, the press secretary said. CA’s deputy press secretary Abul Kalam Azad Majumder and Apurba Jahangir were also present at the press conference.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/251957/no-compromise-with-india-on-sovereignty-student-leaders

Bangladesh set West Indies 287 to win second Test,"Jaker Ali's Test-best innings of 91 lifted Bangladesh to 268 all out in their second innings and left the West Indies with a daunting victory target on the fourth day of the second and final Test at Sabina Park on Tuesday. Having trailed on first innings by 18 runs, the home side are now required to go against history in pursuit of 287 for a 2-0 sweep of the series. The highest successful run-chase in a Test at this venue is 212 by the West Indies against Sri Lanka in 2003. Ali's belligerent innings, which occupied 106 deliveries and was embellished by eight fours and five sixes, has tilted the balance heavily in favour of Bangladesh levelling the series and earning their first Test victory in the Caribbean since a 2-0 sweep of a depleted home team in 2009. Such was the extent of the 27-year-old right-hander's dominance of the morning that he contributed 62 of the 75 runs added by the tourists after resuming at the overnight position of 193 for five. Alzarri Joseph and Kemar Roach took three wickets each for the West Indies, Joseph ending Ali's quest for a maiden Test hundred when he was last out, caught at deep midwicket half an hour before lunch.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251955/bangladesh-set-west-indies-287-to-win-second-test

Wildlife trafficker with 305 turtles arrested at HSIA,"A wildlife trafficker possessing 305 turtles illegally was detained at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka on Tuesday. The arrested Md Abul Kashem, 52, holding passport number A15306855, arrived from China. According to the Wildlife Crime Control Unit, the Forest department and the Customs House jointly seized luggage of Abul Kashem and rescued 285 red-eared Slider Turtles and 20 Snapping Turtles. The WCCU wildlife inspector Nargis Sultana said that Kashem illegally transported the turtles, weighing approximately 6 kilograms.  ‘He disclosed that the turtles were intended for illegal trafficking at high prices to other countries via Bangladesh.’ Kashem is a resident of Kurgaon, Ashulia in Dhaka.

HC issues contempt rule over Karnaphuli river land lease,"The High Court on Tuesday issued a contempt of court rule against Chittogong Port Authority chairman SM Moniruzzaman, additional secretary Mohammad Habibur Rahman, and deputy manager Md Shihab Uddin for allegedly violating a 2016 court directive by leasing out a piece of land belonging to the Karnaphuli River. The bench of Justice Farah Mahbub and Justice Debasish Roy Chowdhury asked the officials to explain in four weeks why they should not face punishment for contempt of court. In a 2016 judgment, the High Court directed the port authority and local administrations including the deputy commissioner of Chattogram to conduct a survey of the Karnaphuli River and ensure its protection, including safeguarding its land. On November 7, however, the port authority’s deputy manager issued a tender notice, published in the Daily Purbokone, inviting bids to lease a plot of land along the Karnaphuli River in the Firinghee Bazar area for a period of 10 years. The High Court, responding to a petition filed by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, in the public interest, stayed the tender notice for three months and issued the contempt rule. HRPB lawyer Manzill Murshid told the court that issuing the tender violated the standing High Court directive to protect the Karnaphuli River and its land—a decision previously upheld by the Appellate Division. Murshid argued that leasing out the river’s land not only defied the court’s orders but also posed a direct threat to the existence of the Karnaphuli River and the environment. He stated that such actions by the port authority undermined efforts to safeguard the river, which is vital for the environment and the region’s economic lifeline. Manzill said that the High Court deemed the tender notice illegal and contradictory to its 2016 directive. By granting a three-month stay on the tender notice, the court underscored the importance of adhering to its rulings and protecting the Karnaphuli River from encroachment and misuse. The contempt rule requires the port authority officials to respond to the court and justify their actions regarding the leasing of the river’s land, which has sparked fresh concerns about environmental violations and governance accountability, Manzill later told New Age. He further informed the High Court that the authorities failed to comply with its 2016 directive to remove illegal structures from the banks of the Karnaphuli River in Chattogram, leaving thousands of encroachers unchecked. Referring to the 2016 writ petition, Manzill informed the court that the Chattogram deputy commissioner had been ordered to identify and demolish illegal structures along the riverbank through a survey and submit a compliance report in 90 days. Manzill stated that, in accordance with the court’s directive, the Chattogram DC conducted a five-day eviction drive beginning on February 4, 2019, during which some illegal structures were demolished. The drive, however, was abruptly suspended with assurances that it would resume soon. More than four years later, no further action has been taken. On August 16, 2016, the High Court specifically directed the DC to remove 2,181 illegal structures built on the riverbanks. While the initial drive demonstrated some progress, its suspension has allowed encroachers to continue occupying the land. Manzill further said that officials from the Chattogram district administration and Chattogram Port Authority acknowledged the presence of thousands of illegal occupants who have grabbed port land. Despite this, no measures have been taken to evict them, he said. He said that the inaction jeopardised the Karnaphuli River, a vital lifeline for Chattogram’s economy and environment. Encroachments and the unchecked construction of illegal structures exacerbate the river’s degradation, threatening its ecological balance and utility as a major waterway. The High Court repeatedly emphasised the protection of the Karnaphuli River, directing authorities to preserve its banks and remove unauthorised structures, Manzill said. The continued inaction, however, raises questions about governance and enforcement, as well as the impact of these failures on the river’s long-term sustainability, Manzill added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251952/hc-issues-contempt-rule-over-karnaphuli-river-land-lease

Time of hope and a promise to keep,"THE recent political transition in Sri Lanka, following the presidential and parliamentary elections of September and November, offers a pivotal opportunity to address entrenched issues of exclusion. In his inaugural speech at the 10th Parliament, president Anura Kumara Dissanayake emphasised his commitment to preventing racism and religious extremism in Sri Lanka. He asserted that his government would not allow racist politics to reemerge and pledged to establish a democratic state free from fear and suspicion. The president highlighted the importance of the rule of law, ensuring that no individual or politician is above it. His address also included a promise to investigate controversial crimes, deliver justice to victims, and rebuild public trust in the legal system. President Dissanayake has exceeded expectations as the public face of the NPP government. He is the government’s master communicator neither losing sight of his origins among the people as seen in his attire and demeanour, but also in his policies. The president’s assurance that he would not permit racism and ethnic hatred to get root again in the country is another testament to the value system that he grew up with. His origins in the farming zones of the North Central province, once the heartland of the Sinhala Buddhist kingdoms, and his personal struggles with poverty and overcoming it with the support of the social welfare system set in place by the early governments of Sri Lanka, make him the quintessential Sri Lankan success story. Many decades ago, another leader of Sri Lanka cited the Buddhist teaching that ‘hatred ceases not by hatred but by love (non-hatred)’, a phrase that was repeated by the current Japanese ambassador in his welcome speech at his official residence. Former president J R Jayewardene spoke these words to safeguard Japan from being subjected to reparations after it was defeated in the World War II. The question is the extent to which words are made flesh and become manifest in the world. Unfortunately, president Jayewardene was unable to manifest the words he spoke to the world when it came to his own country. When faced with intractable foes in the JVP and LTTE insurrections, his government countered the ferocious violence of the rebel groups with the ferocious violence of the state.  Commemorating dead SO FAR it appears that president Anura Kumara Dissanayake is living and acting out the values that he speaks. It has been only two months since he won the presidency, so it may be too early to tell for certain, but the signs of sincerity are manifest in his words and deeds and the manner in which he seeks to uphold the national interest. This it seen in the way he has led the Marxist-JVP core of the NPP government into sticking by pragmatic economic policies agreed to by the previous government with the IMF, in which the masses of people have to bear the burden, but to which there seems to be no viable alternative at the present time. The president and his government are being criticised by those who would probably act no differently if they had been in power, except that they would be trying to take their own cut, for which good reason the people rejected them. The government’s approach to the controversy about the memorialisation of the departed persons known as Maveerar (Heroes) Day was also an instance where the president and his government stood by their values and gave the Tamil people who wished to commemorate their fallen sons and daughters in the three decade long war, the opportunity to do so peacefully and as a community. This has in fact been endorsed in law by the Office for Reparations Act No 34 of 2018 which allows for individual and group remembrance (Section 27). The JVP has long commemorated their own dead, their heroes, who fought for social change, for curd to the villages and not only to Colombo, and for revolution. The government was consistent in accepting that the Tamil people had the same right to commemorate those who lost their lives in the struggle for their rights. A news report stated ‘T Sellathurai and his wife turned up at the event in Kodikkamam, Jaffna, to commemorate the deaths of two of their sons, whose remains were buried in the one-time cemetery, now a military base. The symbolic event was organised on a private plot of land opposite the military base. ‘We just want to remember our sons, and we came with their favourite food for prayers. ‘On this occasion, the government’s position was that the fallen people could be commemorated, but not the organisation they belonged to. Another news report stated that ‘A 29-year-old youth from Inuvil, Jaffna was taken into police custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Act this week. The youth was arrested by the Terrorist Investigation Division officers in connection with the messages he had shared on social media during the Maveerar Day events this week. ‘Maybe in the future, the police will not intervene to cover the pictures of the LTTE leaders, just as much as they do not cover the pictures of the JVP leaders. There has been strong criticism by opposition politicians about the government’s permission to hold the LTTE commemorations. The power of ethnic nationalism to revive cannot be underestimated. The permission given by the government to the commemoration ceremonies in the north and east of the country is, however, not a new phenomenon. Similar permission was also given by the previous governments in which former president Ranil Wickremesinghe played a lead role, and for which he needs to be appreciated for standing for a non-racist Sri Lanka. The former president has long represented the cosmopolitan, multi-ethnic and plural character of Sri Lankan society, though it has periodically got overwhelmed by competing nationalisms that become incredibly powerful when backed by ethnic nationalist government leaders. The JVP has traditionally been closer to this latter thinking, which is why all the more credit should go to president Dissanayake for the positive change today.  Muslim exclusion IN KEEPING with its pledge to be non-racist in governance, the NPP government has been making a strenuous effort to rectify its failure to include a Muslim in its first cabinet of ministers. This is the first time that the Muslim community finds itself excluded from being part of decision making at the highest level of government. Although the government has attempted to rectify the situation by appointing a Muslim as the deputy speaker and another as a deputy minister, the sense of exclusion continues to trouble the Muslim community, especially as a significant number of them voted for the government. However, it also needs to be noted that in the past, even when governments had multiple Muslim ministers, this did not prevent significant injustices taking place against the Muslim community. In particular, after the end of the three-decade long war, in which the Tamil community was the main protagonist at the receiving end, the Muslim community became the main target of nationalist groups. There were terrible riots against the Muslims, where their properties were looted and destroyed, and some were killed, while the perpetrators were permitted to go on the rampage. The presence of multiple Muslim ministers in the cabinet did not stop this pillage. Much before the country got into a debt trap, even before it became a country of widespread corruption, there was an ethnic divide that corroded the spirit of unity in the country. At the very dawn of Independence, the Tamils of recent Indian origin (Malaiyaha Tamils) were denied their citizenship and excluded from the polity. This was followed by the denial of equal language rights to all the Tamil-speaking peoples, through the policy of Sinhala-only, which led to the first mass migration of Sri Lankan citizens out of the country when the most educated community at that time, the Burgher community, emigrated to foreign lands. Today, people from the four corners of the country and the middle as well, have voted for change, unity and a new start. This is the unique opportunity that the NPP government has and the promise it must keep.

Revisiting Shahbagh events and July-August uprising,"THE Shahbagh movement of 2013 and the recent July-August uprising stand as defining chapters in the evolving narrative of Bangladesh’s socio-political history. The two protests, distinct in origins and goals though, explain interwoven paths of public mobilisation, collective memory and the exercise of state power. The Shahbagh movement emerged from a nation’s quest for justice, its rallying cry demanding the death penalty for Abdul Quader Molla, a leader of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami convicted of war crimes of the 1971 Liberation War. This protest was an expression of national pride and historical trauma, uniting urban youth, activists and civil society actors under a singular vision of rectifying the moral wounds of the past. In contrast, the July-August uprising has emerged as a call for systemic transformation. It has grown from the discontent of people grappling with governance failures, rampant corruption and widening economic inequality. Unlike Shahbagh’s narrowly focused pursuit of historical accountability, the 2024 uprising has represented a more inclusive and expansive demand for structural reforms, justice and institutional transparency. It has sought to confront the inequity and the authoritarianism that had taken root in the nation’s political and economic frameworks. Together, the protests offer a comparative lens to explore the dynamics of grass-roots activism, the role of state power and the nuanced interplay between justice, democracy and authoritarianism. By examining the watershed events through a theoretical framework, it could be possible to shed light on the intricate forces that shape collective action and governance and delve deeply into the legacy of protests, reflect on how they challenge the understanding of sustainable democracy and chart a course for civic engagement.  Theoretical frameworks THE social movement theory provides for a critical framework to understand the organisational dynamics and resource mobilisation that sustained both Shahbagh and the July-August uprising. Social movement theory Shahbagh protests: The movement harnessed key resources that included state support, the approval that the Awami League tacitly lent to the protests for political legitimacy and material support; media and civil society that prositioned the protests as a moral crusade, by widening its reach through extensive coverage and intellectual promotion; and digital activism that mobilised the youth on social networks to spread information and create a collective identity. July-August uprising: The protests was more characterized by a decentralised grass-roots organization; its leadership remained largely independent while political groups tried to co-opt the events; the uprising addressed tangible grievances such as inflation, unemployment and inequality, mobilising diverse demographics; and broad participation with representation from rural and marginalised communities unlike the Shahbagh protests.  Cultural theory The cultural theory underlines the role of collective memory and symbolism top drive the mobilisation. Shahbagh protests: The movement was rooted in the cultural memory of the 1971 liberation war. It invoked nationalistic pride through symbolism, Shahbagh being used as the protests site linked to the movement of Bangladesh’s struggles;  artistic expressions such as slogans, songs, and poems that lent a cultural resonance to the protests that spoke about national identity; and moral framing, which projected the demand for the death penalty as a moral duty to save the dignity of the nation. July-August uprising: The events were designed using a wider cultural critique such as economic and social justice, which was born out of systemic injustice; and modern symbolism, which used modern icons such as social media influencers and grass-roots leaders to reach a digitally active generation. Political process theory The political process theory studies the role of political opportunities along with institutional mechanisms in influencing the outlines of movements. Shahbagh protests: In alignment with state power, the government’s support meant immediate political and institutional support but questioned the judiciary’s independence; Judicial instrumentalisation that resulted in the amendment to legal changes to appease the demands of the protests, which came about as certain threat to the politicisation of justice; and delegitimisation of opposition in which Jamaat-e-Islami, among others, had been systematically belittled. July-August uprising: The uprising came upon a political void and economic discontent, capitalising on general discontent; and in contrast to Shahbagh protests, the uprising established its own political opportunities through the bottom-up organisation and challenge to the entrenched political elite.  Fascism as lens BOTH the protests present contrasting dynamics that invite an analysis through the lens of authoritarian and democratic tendencies. The Shahbagh protests, in an overt alignment with state power and reliance on orchestrated narratives, displayed characteristics more closely associated with fascist traits. In contrast, the July-August uprising emerged as a grass-roots effort, actively challenging authoritarian structures and seeking to dismantle entrenched systems of oppression, positioning itself as a movement aimed at resisting fascism and advocating for inclusive reform. Mass mobilisation Shahbagh’s mass gatherings, amplified by media and state resources, mirrored the theatrical populism associated with fascist movements; and in contrast, the mobilisation in the July-August uprising was dispersed and less dependent on the dramaturgy of the movement. Suppression of opposition: The Shahbagh protests demonised any opposition, labelling critics as anti-patriotic and repressing Islamist counter-movements. The July-August uprising was suppressed by the state, but it retained its plural voice and, therefore, inclusivity. State propaganda: The Shahbagh events relied heavily on state-driven narratives to frame themselves as a moral crusade; but the July-August uprising used social media and grass-roots communication to counter state propaganda. Exclusionary nationalism: The Shahbagh rhetoric marginalised pluralistic debates, sidelining alternative approaches to justice; but the July-August uprising sought inclusivity, addressing systemic issues across social and economic divides.  Role of govt and policy Shahbagh protests State facilitation: The government facilitated protests, providing administrative and logistical support while suppressing opposing movements; and judicial interventions: Legal amendments such as retroactive application of harsher sentences, demonstrated responsiveness to public pressure but compromised judicial independence. July-August uprising State suppression: The government sought to quell protests through crackdown, media censorship and targeted arrests; andresistance to co-optation: Despite attempts by political parties to hijack the movement, its leadership maintained autonomy, underscoring its grass-roots origins.  Comparative implications Democratic deficit The Shahbagh protests have exposed critical vulnerabilities within Bangladesh’s democratic framework, especially regarding the risks associated with state co-optation of grass-roots activism. While the movement had genuine calls for justice at its inception, its eventual alignment with government narratives and reliance on state-backed media made the line separating organic public mobilisation and orchestrated populism increasingly thin. This raised concern about dissenting voices being marginalised and judicial processes becoming politicised, undermining pluralism and independence standards normally associated with a healthy democracy. In contrast, the July-August uprising emerged as a robust demand for systemic reforms, fastening accountability, inclusivity and institutional restructuring. Unlike the Shahbagh events, which got entangled with state interests, the July-August uprising retained its grass-roots authenticity, representing a broader spectrum of public grievances. This distinction highlights a critical evolution in the nature of political mobilisation — one that underlines the population’s growing insistence on genuine democratic processes and transparency, free from state manipulation. Polarisation The Shahbagh events deepened the crack within society, especially along ideological and partisan lines. By framing its cause as a moral crusade tied to nationalism, the events alienated large sections of the population, especially those critical of its alignment with the ruling party or sympathetic to Jamaat-e-Islami. This binary framing — patriot versus traitor — exacerbated ideological rifts and fostered an environment where dissent was vilified, leaving little room for nuanced debate or reconciliation. In contrast, the July-August uprising was intrinsically polarising in its critique of the entrenched elite and governance failures yet tried to bridge demographic divides by uniting diverse groups under a shared demand for justice and systemic change. The movement’s inclusivity across classes, professions and regional identities underscored its intent to build solidarity rather than deepen fragmentation. However, its confrontational stance against the political establishment still pose challenges to fostering national cohesion.  Legacy THE legacy of the Shahbagh protests is multi-layered. It sets a very dangerous precedent, on the one hand, where state-backed mass mobilisation was used to push forward an agenda and opened up the potential for misuse by future governments to consolidate power or decimate opposition. The Shahbagh protests, on the other hand, also shows the power of collective memory and grass-roots activism in forcing major national discourses, even within a limited framework shaped by state influence. In contrast, the July-August uprising 2024 represents a shift towards grass-roots empowerment and a rejection of authoritarian tendencies. It is a critical juncture in political development because it challenges the status quo and focuses on bottom-up reform. Although the ultimate outcomes of the uprising are uncertain, its emphasis on inclusivity and systemic change has set the stage for a potential recalibration of governance and civic engagement. The two protests put together show the interaction of power, activism and democracy in carving the political topography.  Conclusion THE Shahbagh protests of 2013 and the July-August uprising of 2024 epitomise two very different yet inextricably interwoven trajectories of political mobilisation in socioeconomic history. Both born as a result of dissatisfaction felt by society and the demands thereof for justice, they explain and illustrate the transformative capabilities that come with collective action. Their course then, however, sharply diverges vis-à-vis scope, method and implications for democracy. The Shahbagh protests had the depth of collective memory and national identity in invoking a whole nation in unfinished business in historical justice for atrocities of 1971. Its catch-all slogans, high level of cultural resonance, and emotional appeals for accountability made the movement a high-water mark. However, the way that mobilisation aligned with state power, exclusionary nationalism and suppression of dissent proved to be one of the risks of the authoritarian drift that always haunts state-backed mobilisation movements. As Benjamin Franklin once warned, ‘Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.’ Shahbagh’s articulation along state mechanisms underlined the fragility of justice versus erosion of democratic mores. In contrast, the uprising of July-August reflected a greater critique of systemic failures. It channelled public disappointment with governance issues, economic inequality and institutional decay into a grass-roots movement of inclusivity seeking structural reforms. In sharp contrast to the Shahbagh events, this uprising celebrated diversity in its critique of the entrenched elite and failed institutions, uniting disparate demographics under a common vision for justice and systemic change. As Nelson Mandela once said, ‘A critical, independent and investigative press is the lifeblood of any democracy.’ That ethos was best exemplified in this 2024 uprising to demand accountability from the grass roots up. These two evens, together, provide for key lessons regarding complexities of justice, democracy and governance. They point at the need to balance historical accountability with pluralism, making sure that the quest for justice does not undermine the very principles of democracy. The Shahbagh events and the July-August uprising remind us of the invariable tension between state power and grass-roots agency, with the risks of co-optation of collective action towards partisan or authoritarian ends. The evens, as Bangladesh struggles to find the right course of its political journey, stand out as important touchstones on the perennial problems of constructing a viable and inclusive democracy: vigilant nurseries of authoritarianism, a commitment to pluralism and the need to nurture an empowered, independent civil society. As Martin Luther King Jr once said, ‘The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.’ For Bangladesh, the lessons of Shahbagh protests and the July-august uprising are like guiding stars on that arc, pointing toward a more fair and democratic society.

Unmasking corruption chronicles,"ONCE upon a time, in the magical land of Bangladesh, a peculiar phenomenon unfolded. It was a tale straight out of a blockbuster film, replete with greedy masterminds, shadowy operatives and a script so outrageous that even the most seasoned storytellers would blush. Picture this: politicians, bureaucrats, businessmen and financial rogues assembling in dimly lit rooms, planning their audacious escape routes — not to freedom, but to tax havens around the world. As if auditioning for Ocean’s Eleven, these characters laundered an amount of money so staggering it could put the GDP of small countries to shame. Between 2009 and 2023, a jaw-dropping $230 billion, equivalent to 28 lakh crore Bangladeshi taka, quietly tiptoed out of the country, leaving behind an economy gasping for air. At the heart of this escapade was a perfect concoction of bribery, corruption and financial chicanery — a malignant tumour, as one report aptly described it, devouring the nation’s wealth. The modus operandi was as cinematic as it gets. Illicit cash flowed through covert channels, crossing borders under the guise of ‘investments.’ Dubai welcomed these ill-gotten gains with open arms, as Bangladeshis allegedly acquired 532 luxury properties worth $375 million. Malaysia played host to 3,600 Bangladeshi participants in its Second Home Program, their investments greasing the wheels of an international laundry cycle. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom and Canada weren’t far behind, offering sanctuary to the unholy trinity of laundered cash, dubious investments and scandalous secrets. This elaborate heist wasn’t orchestrated by mere mortals; no, it required a sinister synergy. Politicians greased palms, businessmen manipulated markets, bureaucrats forged papers and financial wizards conjured figures that would make even Enron blush. The result? A vicious cycle where shadow economies flourished, public resources vanished and oligarchs thrived. If there were ever a Bangladeshi adaptation of House of Cards, these players would surely rival Frank Underwood in cunning and corruption. Yet, the audacity didn’t end there. With the precision of a chess grandmaster, state mechanisms were co-opted to ensure the heist’s success. The banking sector became a playground for crooks, where distressed loans ballooned to Tk 6.75 lakh crore — enough to construct 22 Padma Bridges. But instead of bridges, the money bridged the gap between the corrupt elite and foreign havens. One could almost hear the banking sector groaning under the weight of what some dubbed a ‘black hole.’ The stock market wasn’t spared either. With a flair that would make The Wolf of Wall Street look like an amateur production, manipulators syphoned off Tk 1 lakh crore. Fraud, insider trading and placement share scams turned the market into a circus. The ringmasters were a mix of entrepreneurs, auditors and issue managers who pulled the strings while ordinary investors watched their savings vanish. In this financial circus, the only animals were sacrificial lambs — innocent citizens duped into believing in a system rigged against them. Public projects fared no better. Roads, bridges, power plants and hospitals were turned into cash cows, with up to 40 per cent of project costs mysteriously disappearing. Development budgets became treasure chests for extortionists, bribe-takers and middlemen. As one might find in a Dickensian tale, these funds were whisked away from public coffers to fill the pockets of the elite, leaving the rest of the populace to wonder whether ‘development’ was just another word for ‘daylight robbery.’ Of course, no corruption saga is complete without creative accounting. Official statistics were weaponised, with GDP figures massaged to resemble a Herculean economy. Inflation was downplayed, much like an amateur magician hiding a rabbit in his hat. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics became a stage for political theatre, churning out data so skewed it could rival Orwell’s 1984. Adding to the spectacle was the emergence of oligarchs — Bangladesh’s very own supervillains. These figures, born out of crony capitalism, controlled policy-making with an iron grip. Like a dark version of Marvel’s Avengers, they assembled not to save the nation but to exploit it. They built mansions abroad, sent their children to elite foreign schools and stashed their wealth in secret offshore accounts, leaving behind a broken economy and disillusioned citizens. But the true genius of this story lies in its brazenness. Why stop at stealing money when you can rewrite the rules? Regulations collapsed, institutions crumbled and watchdogs turned into lapdogs. The government’s so-called ‘vanity projects’ became monuments to wastefulness, with costs inflated to astronomical levels. Critics might call it a tragedy, but in this theatre of the absurd, it was a comedy of errors — except the punchline was delivered at the expense of taxpayers. Behind this theatrical farce was a cast of familiar faces. Political leaders and their cronies pocketed billions, while bureaucrats perfected the art of red tape. Contractors played the role of courier pigeons, delivering bribes to foreign addresses. It was a game of musical chairs where every player won — except the ordinary citizens, who were left standing in an empty room. The international stage wasn’t blind to this drama. Reports from Global Financial Integrity and the Tax Justice Network painted a grim picture of a nation haemorrhaging wealth. Bangladeshis, it seemed, had mastered the fine art of moving money — except it wasn’t theirs to begin with. The numbers were staggering, the methods ingenious and the accountability non-existent. At the heart of this debacle lies a profound irony. While politicians wax poetic about patriotism, their actions tell a different story. They drained the nation of resources, only to secure their futures abroad. It’s as if they took a page out of Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged, not to celebrate individualism but to abandon responsibility altogether. One cannot help but marvel at the sheer audacity of it all. The white paper, a 397-page opus, lays bare the anatomy of corruption. It exposes the mechanisms, players and consequences of a system so rotten it’s a wonder it hasn’t collapsed entirely. And yet, amidst the despair, there’s a glimmer of hope. The interim government, tasked with cleaning up this mess, has an opportunity to rewrite the narrative. As the report reminds us, the government must now demonstrate political will, institutional reform and a commitment to good governance. It’s a Herculean task, no doubt, but one that must be undertaken. For if Bangladesh is to rise from the ashes of corruption, it must first confront the ghosts of its past. In the end, this saga of money laundering and corruption isn’t just a cautionary tale; it is a call to action. It is a reminder that while greed may drive the few, resilience defines the many. And so, the nation watches, waits and hopes — for accountability, for justice and for a future where prosperity isn’t just an illusion but a reality shared by all.

Governance crisis and sustainable solution,"IN THE wake of the Monsoon Revolution, Bangladesh stands at a critical juncture, facing what could be its last chance to establish genuine democratic governance. In the past, while the nation’s leadership touted various reform initiatives and grand visions, the fundamental issues plaguing the country’s governance structure remained largely unaddressed. The current situation demands more than just superficial changes; it requires a complete overhaul of the systems that allowed corruption, inefficiency, and anti-democratic practices to flourish. The most glaring issue is the hollow nature of Bangladesh’s democratic institutions. While the country maintained a facade of democracy from 1991 to 2007, the subsequent years saw an alarming erosion of democratic norms. The judiciary struggled with political interference, the parliament became increasingly ineffective in its oversight role, and anti-corruption bodies like the ACC became mere symbolic entities. This institutional decay wasn’t merely an administrative concern; it represented a fundamental betrayal of the democratic aspirations that drove Bangladesh’s independence movement.  Economic cost of governance failure THE economic implications of Bangladesh’s governance crisis are far-reaching and severe. Foreign direct investment, crucial for economic growth, remained well below potential due to investors’ concerns about regulatory unpredictability and corruption. The World Bank estimated that corruption and bureaucratic inefficiencies cost Bangladesh several percentage points in GDP growth annually—a staggering loss for a developing economy. The banking sector provided a stark example of how poor governance translates into economic losses. Political lending, inadequate oversight, and corruption led to mounting non-performing loans, threatening the stability of the entire financial system. The cost of recapitalising state-owned banks diverted precious resources from critical development needs like education and healthcare. Small and medium enterprises, which should be the backbone of economic growth, faced particularly harsh conditions. Unable to navigate the complex web of bureaucratic requirements without political connections or substantial bribes, many promising businesses either failed to launch or remained trapped in the informal sector, limiting their growth potential and tax contributions to the state.  Syndicate stranglehold THE entrenchment of syndicates in Bangladesh’s economy created a parasitic system that affected every aspect of daily life. In the essential commodities market, powerful cartels manipulated supply chains with devastating efficiency. During religious festivals like Ramadan, these syndicates artificially inflated prices of basic necessities, forcing millions of low-income families to reduce their food consumption. The transportation sector provides another telling example. Bus and trucking syndicates not only controlled routes and fares but also resisted safety improvements and professional training requirements, contributing to Bangladesh’s appalling road safety record. The human cost was enormous—thousands of preventable deaths annually — while the economic cost in terms of lost productivity and healthcare expenses ran into billions of takas. Even the construction industry couldn’t escape syndicate control. A small group of contractors, backed by political patrons, dominated public infrastructure projects, leading to inflated costs and substandard work quality. The collapse of several infrastructure projects highlighted how this system compromised public safety while draining public resources.  Learning from others: comparative perspectives WHILE serious, Bangladesh’s governance challenges are not unique. Other developing nations have successfully implemented reforms that could serve as models. Indonesia’s post-Suharto reforms offer valuable lessons in transitioning from an authoritarian system to a more democratic governance structure. The country’s success in strengthening its anti-corruption commission demonstrates the ability to achieve institutional reform despite political resistance. Georgia’s dramatic transformation of its civil service and reduction in petty corruption provides another instructive example. Through comprehensive reform of police services and government bureaucracy, Georgia significantly improved its business environment and public service delivery within a relatively short period. Even neighbouring India, despite its challenges, offers useful lessons in maintaining democratic institutions and an independent judiciary. The Indian Supreme Court’s activism in governance issues and the Election Commission’s relative independence provide models for institutional autonomy.  Blueprint for reform BANGLADESH needs comprehensive reform across multiple fronts. First, the judiciary must be granted genuine independence, not just in theory but in practice. This means establishing transparent appointment processes, ensuring adequate funding, and creating effective mechanisms to prevent executive interference. The current backlog of cases — over 3.7 million pending cases—must be addressed through modernisation of court procedures and increased judicial capacity. Second, anti-corruption efforts need to move beyond symbolism. The ACC should be restructured as a truly independent body with robust investigative powers and the authority to prosecute corruption at all levels, including the highest echelons of power. This requires not only legislative changes but also guaranteed budget allocations and protection for ACC officials from political interference. Third, the civil service needs comprehensive reform focusing on merit-based recruitment and promotion, professional training, and clear accountability mechanisms. This must be accompanied by measures to insulate the bureaucracy from political interference while ensuring its responsiveness to public needs. Digital systems for government services should be expanded to reduce opportunities for corruption and improve efficiency. Fourth, breaking syndicate control requires a multi-pronged approach: establishing an independent competition commission with real enforcement powers; creating transparent market monitoring systems for essential commodities; implementing strict penalties for price manipulation and anti-competitive practices; developing alternative supply chains to reduce market concentration; and protecting whistleblowers who expose cartel activities. Fifth, strengthening local governance requires increased fiscal decentralisation and direct election of local officials. There is no alternative to local democratic governance in the true sense of the term. Deployed officials from the centre must be accountable to the elected leadership. Both capacity building for local administration and community participation in development planning would be critical for development at the grassroots.  The road ahead THE current global landscape, characterised by uncertainty and rapid transformation, makes these reforms even more urgent. Bangladesh cannot afford to continue with business as usual if it hopes to achieve sustainable development and maintain its economic progress. The recent mass uprising suggests that citizens are increasingly unwilling to accept the status quo. However, turning this popular dissatisfaction into meaningful change will require more than just street protests. It demands sustained pressure for reform, coupled with clear alternatives to current governance practices. Success will require building broad coalitions for reform, including business leaders who understand that poor governance ultimately threatens their interests, civil society organisations that can mobilise public support, and reform-minded officials within the government itself. The choice facing Bangladesh is stark: either embrace fundamental reform now or risk deeper instability in the future. The country’s leadership must recognise that genuine democratic consolidation, while potentially threatening current power structures, is essential for long-term stability and development. The time for half-measures and symbolic reforms has passed. Bangladesh needs decisive action to address its governance crisis before it’s too late.

"Authorities need to attend to fertiliser, seed crisis","THIS is worrying that potato growers in the north are faced with a shortage of seeds and fertiliser. The shortage, coupled with high prices of both seeds and fertiliser, is likely to impact the potato production in the 16 northern districts, where two-thirds of potatoes are produced. As agricultural authorities have not ensured enough supplies, prices have increased sharply. Farmers in the region allege that syndicates of some dealers, traders and agricultural officials have created the crisis to make windfall profits. Prices of fertilisers have increased by up to Tk 450 a sack. Although divisional offices of the Department of Agricultural Extension have allocated fertiliser for the districts, farmers are struggling to buy the required amount. The divisional offices have also set prices of fertilisers, but the dealers largely ignore them. The government has set Tk 1,000, Tk 1,050 and Tk 1,350 in prices of muriate of potash, diammonium phosphate and triple super phosphate, but Agricultural Development Corporation and Chemical Industries Corporation dealers are charging Tk 1,180, 1,300 and 1,700. Farmers are, meanwhile, also faced with a shortage of seeds and high seed prices. Annual reports of the Department of Agricultural Extension and the Bureau of Statistics say that 10.6 million tonnes of potatoes were produced in in the past season and 7.9 million tonnes were produced in the north. The authorities have set a record target of producing about 9.85 million tonnes of potatoes off 3,650 hectares in the Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions alone in the next season but have not allocated or arranged for seeds and fertiliser required to cultivate such an expanse of land. The Agricultural Development Corporation has allocated only 17,140 tonnes of potato seeds for the 16 districts against a demand for 634,000 tonnes, leaving farmers to depend on private businesses. Capitalising on the shortage, private traders are reported to have increased the prices. Dealers and businesspeople are reported to be charging Tk 100–150 a kilogram of potato seed although the price was Tk 65–70 in the past year. Many are struggling to get the required amount of seeds even after paying high prices. The shortage and high prices of seeds and fertiliser now will not only hamper potato production but also impact the market and farmers. The authorities should, therefore, take early measures. The authorities need to assess the shortage, break the syndicates and provide farmers with seeds and fertiliser at affordable prices. The authorities also need to have updated data on crop production and seed and fertiliser requirements and arrange for the required amount of seeds and fertiliser.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/251904/authorities-need-to-attend-to-fertiliser-seed-crisis
Delhi’s apology for Bangladesh mission breach not enough,"A GROUP of people banded under Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, an affiliate of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, having broken into Bangladesh’s assistant high commission in Agartala, the capital of the Indian state of Tripura, on December 2 is unacceptable. The protesters — who marched demanding an early release of the Bangladeshi Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das, reportedly an expelled member of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness order, arrested by Bangladesh authorities on sedition charges on November 25, and an end to ‘attacks on the Hindus’ in Bangladesh — broke into the Bangladesh mission premises, vandalised the flag pole, desecrated Bangladesh’s national flag and damaged property. All this constitutes a breach of Article 22 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961, which lays out that the premise of the mission is inviolable, it must not be entered by the host country except with the consent of the head of the mission and the receiving state must protect the premises of the mission against any intrusion or damage; and, it must prevent any disturbance of the peace of the mission or impairment of its dignity. Indian authorities have failed on all the counts. Indian authorities have, however, expressed regrets about the breach of Bangaldesh mission premises in Agartala, noting the events as ‘deeply regrettable.’ New Delhi has said that it was taking action to step up security arrangements for the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi and all its consular premises in India. Indian authorities also arrested seven people and suspended four police officers by the afternoon on December 3. But an apology is not enough. Indian authorities must, as Bangladesh authorities have called for, take early action to attend to the incident, undertake a thorough investigation of the incident and prevent any recurrence of violence against any diplomatic missions of Bangladesh in India. The West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has, meanwhile, urged India’s central government to seek the deployment of UN peacekeepers and the prime minister Narendra Modi’s intervention to secure the safety of the Hindus in Bangladesh. Whilst a Voice of America survey, made public on November 29, shows that minority communities in Bangladesh are more secure under the interim government compared with how they lived under the Awami League government that was toppled on August 5, going by what the West Bengal chief minister has said, it is, rather, imperative to keep UN peacekeepers deployed in India considering the untoward situation that minority people in India have to face almost each day. Hindus in India the same day held protests outside the Bangladesh mission in Mumbai at the arrest of Chinmoy Krishan Das. The West Bengal Bharatiya Janata Party chief, Suvendu Adhikari, led a protest by a group of BJP legislators that blocked cargo movement at the Petrapole-Benapole land border that day, calling for a five-day blockade of the port in the next week. Hundreds of members of Sanatani Aikya Manch, a combine of Hindu organisations in Assam, joined a Bangladesh Chalo march in Sribhumi in the state the day before to protest at ‘atrocities’ against Hindus in Bangladesh. Security arrangements, however, foiled the marchers at the border. More than one such episodes happening almost the same day can very well be construed as ‘politically orchestrated’ events that could cause further decline in bilateral relations. Delhi must, therefore, attend to Dhaka’s concern.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/251902/delhis-apology-for-bangladesh-mission-breach-not-enough
