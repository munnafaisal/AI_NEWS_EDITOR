New Zealand 86-5 as Brook ton puts England in charge,"New Zealand lost five wickets to be on the ropes in response to England’s 280 after Harry Brook smashed a century on the first day of the second Test on Friday. The Black Caps were 86-5 in Wellington, with England capturing the key wicket of Kane Williamson soon before stumps, leaving Tom Blundell at the crease on seven and nightwatchman Will O’Rourke yet to score. It was a fast-moving opening day, in a similar vein to the first Test in Christchurch, which the tourists won by eight wickets in three and a half days. Brook set the tone with his brilliant 123 off 115 balls, following on from his match-winning 171 at Hagley Oval. He again rescued England, who had crumbled in the first hour to 43-4 after being sent in on a green Basin Reserve pitch. New Zealand’s top order also struggled badly against seam and bounce through an intense last 26 overs of the day. Devon Conway was caught behind off Gus Atkinson for 11 before fellow opener Tom Latham was clean-bowled by captain counterpart Ben Stokes for 17. Rachin Ravindra departed for three, caught by a diving Brydon Carse in close off Chris Woakes. The lively Carse (2-28) then claimed the scalp of dangerman Williamson, caught by diving wicketkeeper Ollie Pope for 37. Daryl Mitchell, on six, snicked a second catch to Pope, down the leg side off Carse. Williamson had survived some near scrapes early in his knock, including being bowled by a superb delivery from Carse, before the anguished seamer was found to have bowled a no-ball by overstepping the mark. Earlier, Brook’s fifth-wicket partnership with Pope (66) proved decisive, the pair counter-punching their way out of trouble with 174 off just 158 balls. The stand was reminiscent of the first Test when the same pair combined for a rapid 151 to revive their first innings. Brook was run out on the last ball of the second session after powering England out of trouble to 259-7, before the final three wickets fell quickly after tea. The in-form Brook registered his eighth century in just 23 Tests, having scored 171 at Hagley Oval a week ago. The lanky 25-year-old’s power once again couldn’t be contained by New Zealand’s seam-heavy attack, striking five sixes and 11 fours before his concentration slipped. He set off for a single to short midwicket but Woakes didn’t respond and Brook was caught short when bowler Nathan Smith hit the stumps in his follow-through. O’Rourke (3-49) earlier removed Pope, who mis-timed a pull shot, and the pace bowler struck again to dismiss Stokes for two, caught behind. Smith (4-86) helped to wrap up the tail, having claimed two wickets with the new ball, along with Matt Henry (2-43). New Zealand’s poor catching from Christchurch was quickly forgotten, snapping up three sharp chances in the opening overs. The impressive Henry had Ben Duckett caught by a diving Latham at second slip without scoring before bowling fellow-opener Zak Crawley for 17. Smith had both Jacob Bethell (16) and Joe Root (3) caught behind, with Mitchell grabbing a flyer with one hand at first slip to remove Root.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252187/new-zealand-86-5-as-brook-ton-puts-england-in-charge
Spurs rocked as Huijsen seals Bournemouth’s shock win,"Ange Postecoglou slammed Tottenham’s flops as furious fans turned on the Australian and his spluttering side after Bournemouth condemned them to a shock 1-0 defeat on Thursday. Dean Huijsen netted in the first half at the Vitality Stadium to leave Postecoglou’s troubled team with just one win in their last six games in all competitions. The 19-year-old defender’s first goal in English football after his close-season move from Juventus exposed the flaws in Tottenham’s error-prone defence. Lacklustre Tottenham were fortunate not to lose by a bigger margin as Andoni Iraola’s side wasted several chances to increase their lead. Tottenham’s sixth Premier League defeat this season was another setback for the under-fire Postecoglou after last weekend’s disappointing 1-1 draw at home to 10-man Fulham. ‘It’s not good enough. We again fell into the trap of starting the game really well and then we conceded a really poor goal,’ Postecoglou said. ‘It’s disappointing. We have this propensity to shoot ourselves in the foot when we should be controlling games. ‘It’s something we’ve done consistently and we always pay the price for it.’ Having wasted a golden opportunity to qualify for the Champions League last season, Postecoglou is beginning to hear criticism of his overly-attacking tactics and this dismal display will add to the Australian’s doubters. Tottenham are languishing in 10th place, six points adrift of the top four heading into Sunday’s London derby against second-placed Chelsea. ‘The fans have every right to be disappointed. I got some pretty direct feedback with the way that we are going at the moment and that is rightly so,’ Postecoglou said after he was jeered by Tottenham fans after the final whistle. ‘I didn’t like what was being said because I’m a human being but you’re going to cop it. ‘All I can say is I’m determined to get it right and will keep fighting until we do.’ Ninth-placed Bournemouth have now beaten Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham at home this season. Dominic Solanke scored 21 times for Bournemouth last term before moving to Tottenham in the close-season. The England striker wasted a good chance to enjoy a scoring return to his old club when he blazed over from 10 yards after muscling through on goal. Bournemouth’s Evanilson nearly punished sloppy defending from Radu Dragusin and Destiny Udogie with a close-range effort that Fraser Forster pushed away for a corner. But Tottenham’s reprieve was short-lived as the Cherries took the lead from the resulting set-piece in the 17th minute. Marcus Tavernier curled his corner towards the far post and Huijsen easily escaped Tottenham’s woeful marking to head home from five yards. - Postecoglou angst - Tottenham were vulnerable at the back whenever Bournemouth attacked with intent and Forster had to make a superb save to repel Tavernier’s close-range header from Milos Kerkez’s cross. Postecoglou finished the first half shaking his head in frustration and his dejected expression was unchanged after the break. Postecoglou sent on Tottenham captain Son Heung-min, who has only scored four times this season, and the South Korean’s first touch was a goal disallowed for offside. James Maddison curled narrowly wide before Kepa Arrizabalaga saved well from Pedro Porro’s volley. Ryan Christie smashed against the post from Evanilson’s pass and Tavernier drilled just wide as Bournemouth threatened to blow Tottenham away in the gale-force winds lashing the south-coast. In Thursday’s other game, Alex Iwobi scored twice as Fulham took advantage of a howler from Brighton keeper Bart Verbruggen to beat the Seagulls 3-1 at Craven Cottage. Marco Silva’s men were gifted the lead in the fourth minute when Verbruggen, under minimal pressure, tried to pass to Carlos Baleba on the edge of the area, with Iwobi intercepting and slotting into the empty net. Brighton levelled in the 56th minute when Baleba fired past Bernd Leno from 25 yards. But Fulham went ahead again with 11 minutes remaining when Andreas Pereira’s corner skimmed off Calvin Bassey and went in off Brighton’s Matt O’Riley for an own goal. Iwobi’s curler sealed the points with three minutes left as Fulham moved up to sixth place after their third win in their last five league games.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/252186/spurs-rocked-as-huijsen-seals-bournemouths-shock-win
"Liverpool face Merseyside derby cauldron, Chelsea defy expectations","Premier League leaders Liverpool will expect more magic from Mohamed Salah when they meet Everton in an emotional Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. Chelsea face Tottenham having emerged as unexpected title contenders, while West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui and Wolves manager Gary O’Neil battle to avoid the sack. Mohamed Salah’s blistering form could be the ideal antidote to Everton’s frenzied fans when Liverpool face their rivals for the last Merseyside derby at Goodison Park in the Premier League. Everton host the Reds for the final time at their home of 132 years in a top-flight match on Saturday, with the Toffees due to move to a new stadium at Bramley Moore Dock in time for next season. Goodison is always hostile territory for Liverpool but the significance of their latest domestic squabble means the Everton faithful will be ramped up even more than usual. ‘I’d like to think it’ll bring our fans to the fore,’ Everton manager Sean Dyche said. Liverpool will be confident of silencing the raucous atmosphere if Egypt star Salah maintain his hot streak On Wednesday, Salah, who has netted nine times in his last seven league matches, scored twice in a 3-3 draw at Newcastle, surpassing Wayne Rooney’s record by scoring and assisting in the same Premier League game for the 37th time. Salah is out of contract at the end of the season and said last week he was ‘disappointed’ by the club’s failure to offer him a new deal. But, with 15 goals in all competitions this term, Salah’s value is clear to Liverpool boss Arne Slot. ‘Every time we need Mo Salah he scores a goal. We are hoping and expecting he can continue this for a long time,’ he said. When Enzo Maresca arrived at Stamford Bridge in June, the new Chelsea boss was widely seen to have inherited an impossible job. Tasked with marshalling a bloated squad filled with talented but underachieving youngsters, while coping with demanding Chelsea co-owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali, the Italian had taken a major risk by leaving promoted Leicester to replace Mauricio Pochettino. But fast forward just six months and the sound of Maresca being serenaded by Chelsea fans during Wednesday’s 5-1 win at Southampton underscored the 44-year-old’s impact in a short space of time. Chants of ‘We’ve got our Chelsea back’ echoed around St Mary’s and ahead of Sunday’s London derby at Tottenham, the Blues sit in second place, seven points behind Liverpool, after extending their unbeaten league run to six games. It might be too soon for inexperienced Chelsea to win the title, but a top four finish would be tangible reward for their improvement under Maresca. ‘It was a very good feeling, especially because you can see that they are happy, that is our target,’ Maresca said of Chelsea’s fans. West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui and Wolves manager Gary O’Neil will face their former clubs on Monday in a relegation showdown that could end with one of them being sacked. In the aftermath of Tuesday’s 3-1 loss at Leicester, Lopetegui was reported to have survived a board meeting about his position. But the Spaniard, who replaced David Moyes in the close-season, is not safe yet, with suggestions he could still be dismissed if the Hammers lose at home to fellow strugglers Wolves, who he managed in the 2022-23 season. Despite a £130 million ($165 million) investment in new players, West Ham are 14th, having won just four of their 14 league matches. Wolves have fared even worse, with Wednesday’s 4-0 thrashing at Everton leaving them three points adrift of safety in 19th place. O’Neil, who played for West Ham from 2011 to 2013, heard Wolves fans call for his sacking during their ninth league loss this term. Asked if he expected to be in charge against West Ham, O’Neil said: ‘I can only keep going until things change. You won’t find anyone more hard-working and professional than me.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/252185/liverpool-face-merseyside-derby-cauldron-chelsea-defy-expectations
Australia on top after Starc takes six,"Australia lost opener Usman Khawaja but took first day honours at the day-night second Test in Adelaide Friday after a Mitchell Starc onslaught saw India crumble to 180 all out. At the close, the hosts were 86-1 with Nathan McSweeney not out 38 from 97 balls and Marnus Labuschagne on 20 after the visitors were dismissed on the cusp of tea after winning the toss and opting to bat. A menacing Starc was India’s chief destroyer. He gave the hosts a dream start in removing Yashasvi Jaiswal with the first ball of the match and ended with 6-48 -- his best Test figures. In reply, Australia weathered 10 overs of the pink ball at dusk before Jasprit Bumrah’s persistence paid off, finding extra movement and with it a thick edge from Khawaja (13) that carried to Rohit Sharma at slip. McSweeney took 17 balls to get off the mark and had a life on three when dropped by wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant. But he made the most of his fortune, showing maturity in his second Test, while Labuschagne survived a nervy start as he targets a big score after a lean spell. ‘It’s been my role for a while to attack the stumps and try and make early inroads,’ said Starc. ‘Good way to start a Test. A good day all up. ‘To finish the day just one down... to fight through that sustained pressure from a quality bowling attack is fantastic.’ India came into the clash riding high after a 295-run victory at the first Test in Perth, but Australia have a formidable record in Adelaide, winning all seven pink-ball Tests they have played at the venue. The visitors retained Jaiswal and KL Rahul as openers in preference to Rohit, who missed the first Test on paternity leave and came in at six. But the plan backfired as Starc sensationally trapped Jaiswal lbw from a swinging first ball, with the left-armer’s pumped-up celebration showing how much it meant. Jaiswal scored 161 in his last innings. The returning Shubman Gill then stroked two boundaries in an eventful first over. But the runs dried up and Rahul was at the crease for 40 minutes without scoring when he was given out, caught behind off Scott Boland. Rahul was walking off, but a no-ball was called and he survived. Five balls later and he had another let-off, dropped by Khawaja. Undeterred, he battled on before Starc wove his magic again to remove him for 37. Virat Kohli roared back to form in Perth with an unbeaten century but he was no match for Starc this time, out for seven when Steve Smith collected a slip catch. Gill weathered the storm, but his luck ran out just before the first break when he fell lbw on 31 to the relentless Boland. ‘I thought Australia did well, they set us up nicely with some of the dismissals, but also I don’t think 86-1 is a true reflection of how we bowled,’ said India bowling coach Morne Morkel. ‘I know the score looks like a big gap between the two teams, but we still feel we’re in the game.’ Six wickets tumbled in the second session, including Rohit (3) and Pant (21). Pant should have gone for five, but McSweeney spilled a sharp chance in the gully off Boland, in the side for the injured Josh Hazlewood. But the 35-year-old got his reward four balls later, beating Rohit’s bat to trap him lbw. Pant fell to a vicious climbing ball from Pat Cummins before a hostile Starc returned and took care of Ravichandran Ashwin (22) and Harshit Rana (0) in the space of four balls. With India in trouble, Nitish Kumar Reddy took charge, clobbering two big sixes in one Boland over for his highest Test score of 42 before he and Bumrah fell to Starc and Cummins respectively.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252184/australia-on-top-after-starc-takes-six
Rangpur in GSL final,"Rangpur Riders have reached the final of the inaugural Global Super League, beating Lahore Qalandars by 23 runs in the last group-stage match at the Providence Stadium in Guyana on Thursday.

"Messi to kick off new Club World Cup, Neymar to face Real","Lionel Messi and Inter Miami will kick off FIFA’s new 32-team Club World Cup when the Major League Soccer side take on Egypt’s Al Ahly in the June 15 opener, the draw for the tournament revealed on Thursday. Brazilian team Palmeiras and Portugal’s Porto complete Group A alongside Argentina World Cup winner Messi, whose Miami team were handed a spot by FIFA after finishing top of the regular season standings in MLS. Messi’s former Barcelona team-mate, Brazilian Neymar, will have a reunion with La Liga rivals and European champions Real Madrid in Group H. Twelve European clubs will feature in the tournament with Manchester City facing Juventus in Group G of a tournament which FIFA president Gianni Infantino said would ‘start a new era in club football’. Paris Saint-Germain were drawn in a tough group with Atletico Madrid, Copa Libertadores winners Botafogo of Brazil and Seattle Sounders. FIFA has had to deal with some scepticism over the need for the tournament and the chances of it capturing the imagination of fans but there was plenty of support for the competition among those at the draw. Club officials and former players gathered for Thursday’s draw and US President-elect Donald Trump sent his best wishes in a video message before the ceremony, which took place during a 90-minute live broadcast from a television studio in Miami. ‘The event is going to be incredible,’ said Trump in his message where he praised Infantino as a ‘winner’. ‘We’ve known each other a long time and I’m so honoured to have this kind of relationship because soccer is going through the roof as everyone knows,’ he added. The USA will co-host the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada. Trump’s daughter Ivanka took part in the draw which was presented by former Juventus and Italy forward Alessandro Del Piero and featured celebrities such as model Adriana Lima. The final of the tournament will be held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on July 13. FIFA had struggled to find sponsors and broadcasters for the new tournament but on Wednesday announced a global deal with streaming company DAZN, who will show the games for free. The world governing body has faced opposition from some in the game over the new tournament. FIFpro and the European Leagues body filed a joint complaint to the European Commission against FIFA over the introduction of the tournament into the international match calendar. Opponents of the new tournament have said it adds further congestion to an already crowded schedule and increases the workload of players. But there was little but backing for the competition from the clubs and leagues who will be represented next year. ‘We are very supportive of this tournament, We are excited,’ said PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, who is also chairman of the European Clubs Association. Al-Khelaifi said the tournament was a better way for clubs to perform in the USA than in pre-season friendly tours and would help PSG to spread their brand. There was also support from Don Garber, commissioner of Major League Soccer and vice-chair of the World Leagues Association. ‘The tournament took time to generate all the interest that you are seeing here today,’ said the American. ‘Good things come to those that sort of put in the work and FIFA put in the work and we’re going to have lots of our stadiums involved, ‘There are 100 million fans who follow what we call league (club) soccer and they’re going to be interested to see MLS teams and Mexican teams and see teams from all Europe, South America and the rest of the world, so I’m excited about it, I really am,’ added Garber.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/252182/messi-to-kick-off-new-club-world-cup-neymar-to-face-real
Bangladesh U-19 reach consecutive final,"Bangladesh Under-19 cricket team thrashed Pakistan by seven wickets in the ACC Under-19 Asia Cup’s semi-final at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Friday to advance to the final for the second consecutive time. Bangladesh will take on the eight-time champions India in the final on December 8 in Dubai. India emerged as the winners of the second semi-final against Sri Lanka by seven wickets on the same day. Defending champions Bangladesh comfortably chased the 117-run target, scoring 120 runs in 22.1 overs, thanks to a blistering half-century from skipper Azizul Hakim Tamim. Pakistan were dismissed for a mere 116 runs in 37 overs after being sent to bat first, courtesy of right-arm medium pacer Iqbal Hossain Emmon taking four wickets for 24 runs. Farhan Yusuf top-scored for Pakistan with only 32 runs, while Mohammad Riazullah added 28. No other batter was able to cross double digits. Bangladesh made a shaky start by losing two early wickets.

10-man Mohammedan beat holders Kings,"Malian forward Souleymane Diabate scored the match winner for the 10-man Mohammedan Sporting Club’s solitary goal victory over previous season treble winners Bashundhara Kings in their first meeting of the ongoing Bangladesh Premier League at the Shaheed Dhirendranath Dutta Stadium in Comilla on Friday. In the other day’s match, forward Nabib Newaz Jibon (55th, 68th) scored a brace for Rahmatganj Muslim Friends Society’s 2-0 win over Chittagong Abahani at the Rafiq Uddin Bhuiyan Stadium in Mymensingh. The second consecutive win helped Mohammedan bag six points to reach the top of the table followed by Rahmatganj MFS, who also six points from two games. Diabate scored the match winning goal in the 58th minute, 33-minute later the Mohammedan were reduced to a 10-man side with their goalkeeper Sujon Hossain receiving a straight red card. Sujon in a safety attempt committed foul outside the box when he tackled onrushing Kings forward Rakib Hossain and the referee Symoon Hossain did not hesitate to give Sujon marching order. Shakib Al Hasan came in to fill the gap of Sujon while midfielder Arif Hossain was sacrificed off the ground. Kings were desperately looking to have the lead but Shakib stood strong to save his side, denying Kings midfielder Sohel Rana’s attempt in the final minute of the first half. Kings controlled the possession well from the restart and came close to success once in the 54th minute when Brazilian midfielder Miguel Damasceno only needed to beat Shakib. Mohammedan got the only goal from a counterattack as midfielder Rahim Uddin provided a long ball to Diabate, who easily beat Kings keeper Mehedi Hasan Srabon. Mohammedan could have doubled the lead in the 75th minute but Srabon stopped Diabate to convert the spot kick. Mohammedan started the league campaign with a crushing 6-0 win over promoted Dhaka Wanderers while Rahmatganj started with 3-1 win over Fortis Football Club and Kings crushed Ctg Abahani 6-0.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/252180/10-man-mohammedan-beat-holders-kings
My goal is to perform consistently: Amite,"Amite Hasanwas instrumental in Sylhet’s historic championship run in the recently concluded National Cricket League. The right-handed batter emerged as the season’s top run-scorer, amassing an impressive 785 runs at an average of 78.50 with two centuries and five fifties. In an interview withNew Age’sSaifullah Bin Anowar, the 23-year-old Amite reflects on his journey in cricket and shares his aspirations regarding a potential call-up to the national team. New Age: Sylhet are the new champion of NCL and you have been named the player of the tournament. How’s the feeling right now? Amite Hasan:Alhamdulillah, Sylhet became the champion for the first time. Honestly, it’s a feeling that is hard to put into words. And to be the player in the tournament, it gives me an added pleasure. NA: How was your preparation ahead of the season? Amite:Before the start of the season, I attended the HP team’s camp. I prepared well there. Then, we attended a preparation camp in Sylhet. That also worked out well for us. NA: You captained the team in all but one match. Did you experience any additional pressure in that role? Amite:Most of the senior players on our team are national cricketers, so I didn’t feel much pressure. They were incredibly supportive throughout the tournament. NA: How do you rate Rajin Saleh as a coach? Amite:I’ve been working with Rajin Sir since 2019 and I take great pride in that. I’ve learnt a lot from him. NA: There’s a lot of discussion about the Duke ball. What’s your perspective on it as a batter? We know it retains movement even when it gets old... Amite:As you mentioned, the Duke ball maintains its movement even when it’s old. So, naturally, it’s not easy. In the first season, batters found it difficult. However, we’ve adapted well since then. NA: There’s been talk about a potential national call-up for you. What are your thoughts on that? Amite:To be honest, I don’t think about long-term goals. Whatever the format is, whenever I play it, I only focus on it. Every player dreams of representing the national team, but I believe it’s best to wait for the selectors to decide when I’m ready. My only goal right now is to perform consistently, no matter where I play. NA: What’s your plan with the other two formats of the game? Amite:We’ve got NCL T20 ahead. If I get the chance, I will try to do well. I think if you play red-ball cricket well, then you are also capable to play in other formats too. NA: Can you tell us about your cricketing journey? Amite:I didn’t play in the Under-19 World Cups, but I played in the home series and tours. I started from the U-16 camp of Dhaka Metro. Then I toured for the national U-17. Then I played U-18 for Dhaka Metro. My first-class debut was for Sylhet Division in NA: You’re from Naraynganj. Your career started with Dhaka Metro. Now you’re part of Sylhet’s history. How do you see that? Amite:The biggest thing is that I’ve become a champion. It doesn’t matter for which team I play. NA: What about your life outside cricket? Amite:I am studying BBA at Sonargaon University. I’m a first-year student there. I want to complete my studies besides my cricket.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252178/my-goal-is-to-perform-consistently-amite

Paris stock market rallies as Macron fights on,"The Paris stock market rallied Friday as president Emmanuel Macron sought a way out of France’s political crisis. Chinese indices ended the week with solid gains as China’s economy shows signs of recovery but Seoul retreated as South Korea battles its own leadership upheaval. The dollar firmed ahead of key US jobs data Friday likely to provide further clues on the pace of interest-rate cuts in the world’s biggest economy. Oil prices declined and bitcoin fell back under $1,00,000. The Paris stock market jumped 1.3 per cent in midday deals, strongly outperforming London and Frankfurt on ‘hope that president Emmanuel Macron will serve out his term and that a (French) budget can be passed in the coming weeks’, noted Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown. The luxury sector benefitted also from hopes of a pickup in Chinese demand. Gucci owner Kering topped the Paris CAC 40 as its shares gained more than five per cent. Macron on Friday was holding talks with French political leaders on the left and right as he seeks to name a new prime minister. He adopted a defiant tone in an address to the nation late Thursday, 24 hours after Michel Barnier’s government was ousted in a historic no-confidence vote. The trigger was Barnier’s 2025 budget plan, including austerity measures unacceptable to a majority in parliament, but which were forced through without a vote using special powers. In Asia, shares in Seoul sank more than one per cent and the won weakened to about 1,420 per dollar as lawmakers prepared to hold an impeachment vote Saturday after President Yoon Suk Yeol’s dramatic, short-lived martial law this week. While analysts said the economic fallout from the crisis would likely be limited, the political storm is ongoing. On Friday the head of Yoon’s ruling People Power Party demanded he stand down over the incident, warning he posed a great danger to the country. Hong Kong and Shanghai rallied as investors grew hopeful of fresh stimulus when top Chinese leaders including President Xi Jinping meet to discuss economic policy next week. That gathering follows recent data that gave a glimmer of optimism that China’s near two-year growth slowdown could soon end. Bitcoin was hovering around $98,000 having blasted to the historic peak of $103,800 Thursday on news that US president-elect Donald Trump had picked crypto proponent Paul Atkins to head the nation’s markets regulator.

Billionaires’ wealth more than doubles in 10yrs: UBS,"Billionaires have seen their combined wealth shoot up 121 per cent over the past decade to $14 trillion, Swiss bank UBS said Thursday, with tech billionaires’ coffers filling the fastest. Switzerland’s biggest bank, which is among the world’s largest wealth managers, said the number of dollar billionaires increased from 1,757 to 2,682 over the past 10 years, peaking in 2021 with 2,686. The 10th edition of UBS’s annual Billionaire Ambitions report, which tracks the wealth of the world’s richest people, found that billionaires have comfortably outperformed global equity markets over the past decade. The report documents ‘the growth and investment of great wealth, as well as how it’s being preserved for future generations and used to have a positive effect on society’, said Benjamin Cavalli, head of strategic clients at UBS global wealth management. Between 2015 and 2024, total billionaire wealth increased by 121 per cent from $6.3 trillion to $14.0 trillion — while the MSCI AC World Index of global equities rose 73 per cent. The wealth of tech billionaires increased the fastest, followed by that of industrialists. Worldwide, tech billionaires’ wealth tripled from $788.9 billion in 2015 to $2.4 trillion in 2024. ‘In earlier years, the new billionaires commercialised e-commerce, social media and digital payments; more recently they engineered the generative AI boom, while also developing cyber-security, fintech, 3D printing and robotics,’ UBS said. The report found that since 2020, the global growth trend had slowed due to declines among China’s billionaires. From 2015 to 2020, billionaire wealth grew globally at an annual rate of 10 per cent, but growth has plunged to one per cent since 2020. Chinese billionaire wealth more than doubled from 2015 to 2020, rising from $887.3 billion to $2.1 trillion, but has since fallen back to $1.8 trillion. However, North American billionaire wealth has risen 58.5 per cent to $6.1 trillion since 2020, ‘led by industrials and tech billionaires’. Meanwhile billionaires are relocating more frequently, with 176 having moved country since 2020, with Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and the United States being popular destinations. In 2024, some 268 people became billionaires for the first time, with 60 per cent of them entrepreneurs. ‘The year’s new billionaires were mainly self-made,’ said UBS. The report said US billionaires accrued the greatest gains in 2024, reinforcing the country’s place as the world’s main centre for billionaire entrepreneurs. Their wealth rose 27.6 per cent to $5.8 trillion, or more than 40 per cent of billionaire wealth worldwide. Billionaires’ wealth from mainland China and Hong Kong fell 16.8 per cent to $1.8 trillion, with the number of billionaires dropping from 588 to 501. Indian billionaires’ wealth increased 42.1 per cent to $905.6 billion, while their number grew from 153 to 185. Western Europe’s total billionaire wealth rose 16.0 per cent to $2.7 trillion — partly due to a 24 per cent increase in Swiss billionaires. UAE billionaires’ aggregate wealth rose 39.5 per cent to $138.7 billion. UBS said billionaires faced an ‘uncertain world’ over the next 10 years, due to high geopolitical tensions, trade barriers and governments with mounting spending requirements. Billionaires will therefore need to rely on their previous distinctive traits: ‘smart risk-taking, business focus and determination’. ‘Risk-taking billionaires are likely to be at the forefront of creating two technology-related industries of the future already taking shape: generative AI and renewables/electrification,’ UBS predicted. And more flexible wealth planning will be needed as billionaire families move country and spread around the world. The heirs and philanthropic causes of baby boom billionaires are set to inherit an estimated $6.3 trillion over the next 15 years, UBS said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/252170/billionaires-wealth-more-than-doubles-in-10yrs-ubs
India central bank holds rates despite growth dip,"India’s central bank left interest rates unchanged Friday after judging inflation risks to outweighed concerns over a growth slowdown in the world’s fifth-largest economy. The Reserve Bank of India said the benchmark repo rate, the level at which it lends to commercial banks, would stay at 6.50 per cent, where it has been since February 2023. Major central banks around the world have kicked off a global easing cycle in response to lower inflation — including the US Federal Reserve, which in September cut rates for the first time in four years. Retail inflation has stubbornly remained above monetary policymakers’ four per cent target, reaching a 14-month high of 6.21 per cent in October. RBI governor Shatikanta Das said the bank’s monetary policy committee had taken note of the ‘recent slowdown in the growth momentum’ but judged India’s outlook to be ‘resilient’. ‘The increasing incidence of adverse weather events, heightened geopolitical uncertainties and financial market volatility pose upside risks to inflation,’ Das said. The RBI did cut its minimum cash reserve ratio for lenders to deposit with the central bank from 4.5 to four per cent. A lower cash reserve ratio is a liquidity-boosting measure as it gives banks more money on hand to lend.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/252169/india-central-bank-holds-rates-despite-growth-dip

"S American countries, EU conclude Mercosur trade deal","The EU and four South American countries have concluded a huge, but controversial trade deal that is opposed by France and many European farmers, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen announced on Friday. ‘This is a win-win agreement,’ von der Leyen said in Uruguay, where she was attending a summit of the Mercosur bloc involved in the deal, which also includes Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay. The agreement would create a sprawling free-trade zone of more than 700 million people. She called the agreement — nearly a quarter of a century in the making — ‘a truly historic milestone’ that builds trade bridges at a time when ‘strong winds are blowing in the opposite direction, towards isolation and fragmentation.’ But the European farmers’ group COPA-COGECA  immediately reiterated its opposition to the agreement and called for a ‘flash’ protest in Brussels on Monday. EU countries and the European Parliament ‘must now firmly challenge the terms of this agreement,’ the umbrella organization said. While negotiations have concluded, the EU-Mercosur deal still needs to be greenlit by at least 15 of the European Union’s 27 member nations representing 65 per cent of the EU population, as well as the European Parliament. France, which has been rocked by successive protests by farmers saying the agreement would bring unfair competition, has tried to forge a blocking minority of EU countries. Poland has rallied to France’s side, and Italian government sources say Rome believes ‘the conditions are not met’ to back the deal. The Netherlands and Austria have also expressed reservations. France’s minister for trade, Sophie Primas, said that von der Leyen’s announcement ‘regards only her.’ ‘Today is not the end of the story.... This only commits the commission, not the (EU) member states,’ she said in a statement to AFP. But Germany, desperate to open more trade opportunities amid gloom for its manufacturing sector, had strongly come out in favour of the EU-Mercosur deal, as had Spain. German chancellor Olaf Scholz reacted to the announcement from von der Leyen — a former German defence minister — by saying on X that ‘an important hurdle’ had been overcome. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez hailed a ‘historic agreement with Mercosur to establish an unprecedented economic bridge between Europe and Latin America.’ The broad outlines of a deal were agreed back in 2019 but it was never ratified amid concerns over the impact of Brazilian farming on climate change, among other factors. Von der Leyen nodded to that preoccupation, saying: ‘The EU-Mercosur agreement reflects our steadfast commitment to the Paris Agreement (on fighting climate change) and to the fight against deforestation.’ She said efforts being made by the government of Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to protect the Amazon ‘are welcome, and they are necessary — but preserving the Amazon is a shared responsibility of all humanity.’ She also singled out European farmers, telling them: ‘We have heard you, listened to your concerns, and we are acting on them. This agreement includes robust safeguards to protect your livelihoods.’ The deal, once ratified, would allow the EU to export cars, machinery and pharmaceutical products more easily to South America. In return, Brazil and its neighbours would be able to sell meat, sugar, rice, honey, soybeans and other products to Europe with fewer restrictions. The treaty aims to eliminate most import taxes between the EU and Mercosur to create a vast free-trade area of more than 700 million consumers. Sources familiar with the negotiations told AFP the deal would include changes to ‘several chapters,’ including government contracts, services, intellectual property and the environment. French president Emmanuel Macron on Thursday had repeated a warning to von der Leyen that the agreement was ‘unacceptable in its current state.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/trade-commerce/252167/s-american-countries-eu-conclude-mercosur-trade-deal
FICCI for boosting partnership with govt to attract FDI,"The Foreign Investors’ Chamber of Commerce and Industry reaffirmed its commitment to collaborate with the government in attracting international investors and expanding business opportunities in Bangladesh. The pledge was made during FICCI’s 61st annual general meeting, held on Thursday, at a hotel in the capital Dhaka. FICCI president Zaved Akhtar highlighted the chamber’s accomplishments over the past year, emphasising its role in fostering a favourable investment environment. He identified four key areas critical to foreign investors, including law and order, energy security, a level playing field and predictable policies. Zaved Akhtar stressed the importance of effective law enforcement to ensure smooth business operations and maintain Bangladesh’s international image. He also underscored the need for reliable and affordable energy, fair competition for multinational companies and consistent long-term policies to boost investor confidence. ‘We maintain regular communication with the government and other stakeholders to address these issues, ensuring that foreign investors feel secure and supported in their operations in Bangladesh,’ Zaved Akhtar added. He expressed confidence in Bangladesh’s potential as a global investment hub, saying, ‘With our collective vision, expertise and determination, we will build a prosperous and resilient Bangladesh, a beacon of innovation, inclusivity and sustainability.’ The FICCI president recognised the significant contributions of FICCI’s member companies and stressed the importance of collective efforts to drive economic growth and sustainable development.

World trade outlook uncertain for 2025: UN,"World trade faces an uncertain outlook in 2025 because of the threat of trade wars, after global commerce hit a new peak this year, the UN said on Thursday. The UN trade and development agency UNCTAD said global exchanges of goods and services are expected to reach a record level of nearly $33 trillion in 2024. ‘This $1 trillion increase, reflecting 3.3 per cent annual growth, highlights resilience in global trade despite persistent challenges,’ the UN agency said in a statement. But the report added that ‘the 2025 trade outlook is clouded by potential US policy shifts, including broader tariffs that could disrupt global value chains and impact key trading partners.’ US President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose steeper tariffs on the country’s trade partners, whom he accuses of taking advantage of the America’s open markets. While not mentioning Trump by name, the report said ‘such measures risk triggering retaliation and ripple effects, affecting industries and economies along entire supply chains. Even the mere threat of tariffs creates unpredictability, weakening trade, investment and economic growth.’ The report said China, the European Union, and Vietnam, who all run large trade surpluses with the United States, are most exposed to tariff increases. In 2024, trade in services, which rose 7 per cent on the year, accounted for half of the expansion in overall trade, while goods trade grew just 2 per cent. The UN agency urged ‘developing economies to adopt targeted policies that enhance trade diversification and invest in high-value sectors to mitigate risks.’ UNCTAD secretary-general Rebeca Grynspan said that ‘trade remains a cornerstone of sustainable development.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/trade-commerce/252165/world-trade-outlook-uncertain-for-2025-un
"Dev projects still marred by misspending, wastage: adviser","Adviser for power, energy and mineral resources Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan on Friday said that development projects in Bangladesh were still besmirched with wastage and misspending. He made the remark at the inaugural event of the 6th National HR Convention 2024 organised by the Federation of Bangladesh Human Resource Organisations at Southeast University in the capital Dhaka on the day. ‘The government does not have the means to understand these things. Different donor agencies and consultants explain these issues to us,’ he said. ‘We have already seen the consequences of wastage once. If these misspending and wastages continue, there will be an even bigger rebellion next time. Some think that the interim government is a one-time episode, but it’s not,’ Fouzul Kabir Khan added. ‘When I go on field trips and talk to the people, I observe that the anger still remains inside them,’ the power adviser said. ‘Karnaphuli tunnel was built at the cost of Tk 10,000 crore, however, I have observed while visiting, vehicles do not use that tunnel much. There is no end to wastage in development projects wherever I go,’ the adviser noted. Fouzul said, ‘A power plant was built in Rupsha, Khulna, costing Tk 8,000 crore, but there is no gas available for it. On my way back, I saw that Tk 41,000 crore was spent on the Padma rail bridge, though a few thousand crore was saved in the final stages.’ He continued, ‘I learned that the project was expected to generate Tk 1,400 crore in revenue every year, and I thought it was a good initiative. However, in six months, it only earned Tk 37 crore in revenue, according to officials. This is how these projects are justified.’ He pointed out that such actions were simply wasteful and said that the blame did not lie only with politicians, government officials were also involved. Md Sabur Khan, chairman of Daffodil International University and Global Entrepreneurship Network- Bangladesh Chapter, among others, was present in the event.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/252164/dev-projects-still-marred-by-misspending-wastage-adviser
"Buyers cite weak brand protection, credit restrictions as challenges","The representatives of global apparel brands and buyers have raised concerns over several pressing challenges for business in Bangladesh, including weak brand protection, restrictive credit facilities for imports and the absence of a dedicated green energy plan for the garment and textile sector. At a meeting with chief advisor’s special envoy Lutfey Siddiqi at his office in Dhaka on Thursday, they called on the government to address the issues as part of its broader strategy for economic development and sustainability. The buyers’ representatives said that it was the first time they had had the opportunity to engage directly with the government at a ministerial level. They expressed full support for the government’s agenda on labour standards and rejected the notion that their pricing policies could hinder efforts to improve wages. Underscoring the importance of the apparel industry, Siddiqi expressed gratitude for the constructive engagement and contributions of the buying community during a period of challenges and change. He also conveyed cautious optimism, highlighting metrics such as export volumes, remittances and cargo handlings, which have defied expectations, showing double-digit growth compared to the previous year. Siddiqi said that other factors, such as law and order, labour relations and liquidity seemed to be improving but still required close monitoring. He also said that while structural constraints like port infrastructure, energy infrastructure and skill gaps would take longer to resolve, reforms in decision-making processes should enable faster progress than before. Representatives from several prominent international companies took part in the dialogue, including Ziaur Rahman of H&M Bangladesh, Vikramjeet Singh from Gap Inc and Rezwan Murshed representing Carrefour. Other participants included Jan Rossel of Sports Group Denmark, Rajib K Islam Chowdhury from Allure Sourcing Limited and Jessica Nursoo of VF Corporation. Additionally, Moyeen Chowdhury of Puma SE (World Cat Limited), Mehtap Mir of Otto International and Brunhilde Descamps of Auchan contributed to the discussions.

"Packaged edible oil crisis, high prices affecting consumers","Kitchen markets in Dhaka are in the grip of an edible oil crisis, with chaotic price fluctuations and supply inconsistencies disrupting daily life of low-income consumers, who are already struggling with rising inflation. Prices of both the soya bean and palm oil have been increasing almost every day and the availability of packaged item almost went out. The unpackaged soya bean and palm oil, often a more affordable option for low-income families, had also become significantly more expensive over the past two weeks. Retailers reported that suppliers had significantly reduced the supply of edible oil and pricing consistency was absent at all levels, including wholesale and retail. ‘We are not receiving the required quantity of edible oil from suppliers and at the same time, retailers are being forced to purchase it at high prices from distributors,’ Mizanur Rahman, a retailer at Karwan Bazar, told New Age on Friday. He said that the supply of packaged soya bean oil had drastically fallen in Dhaka’s kitchen markets and in most cases, distributors were charging prices higher than the retail cost labelled on the product. The prices of edible oil increased by Tk 7-10 a litre in past one week and unpackaged soya bean oil sold for Tk 170-175 a litre while the packaged item sold for Tk 175-178 a litre on Friday. A five-litre bottle of soya bean oil sold for Tk 850 on the city markets. Palm oil sold for Tk 170-175 a litre on the city markets on the day. Recently, the vegetable oil refiners’ association has sent a letter to the Trade and Tariff Commission seeking upward revision of edible oil prices, saying that the prices of both the soya bean and palm oil went up on the international market. In the letter, refiners also said that traders were proceeding cautiously with opening letters of credit for importing edible oil due to the government’s lack of decision on price adjustments on the local market. An official from a large edible oil refinery company in the country, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the prices of both soya bean and palm oil had risen on the international market, with the price of palm oil unexpectedly surpassing that of soybean oil. He said that refiners reduced the supply of packaged items to avoid losses from producing bottles, as the local prices had not been adjusted in line with international price increases. He also claimed that the supply of unpackaged edible oil remained available. The prices of other commodities, including vegetables, onions and potatoes, remained high on Dhaka’s kitchen markets over the week ending Friday. Aubergine sold for Tk 80-100 a kilogram, papaya for Tk 40-50 a kilogram, bitter gourd for Tk 80-100 a kilogram, pointed guard for Tk 50-60 a kilogram, okra for Tk 60-70 a kilogram, string beans for Tk 80-90 a kilogram, teasel gourd for Tk 70-80 a kilogram, ridge gourd for Tk 60-70 a kilogram, snake gourd for Tk 60-70 a kilogram, beans for Tk 60-70 a kilogram and tomato for Tk 150-160 a kilogram on Friday. The price of green chillies remained stable and the item sold for Tk 100-120 a kilogram in the city on the day. The price of potatoes remained high and the item sold for Tk 75-80 a kilogram on the city’s kitchen markets on Friday. The prices of onions also remained high and its local variety sold for Tk 120-130 a kilogram while the imported item sold for Tk 90-110 a kilogram on Friday. The coarse and medium-quality varieties of rice sold for Tk 53–60 a kilogram on Friday. Lower-grade Miniket sold for Tk 70-75 a kilogram over the week. The fine variety of Miniket sold for Tk 78–82 a kilogram and Najirshail for Tk 80-90 a kilogram on Friday. The prices of broiler chicken decreased by Tk 10 a kilogram and the item sold for Tk 170-200 a kilogram while Sonalika variety of chicken sold for Tk 280-290 a kilogram on the day. The prices of garlic remained high and its local variety retailed at Tk 230–260 a kilogram while imported garlic sold for Tk 220–240 a kilogram on the day. The price of sugar remained high over the week and the item sold for Tk 135-140 a kilogram on Friday. The price of eggs decreased by Tk 2 a hali (four pieces) and the item sold for Tk 48-50 a hali on the city’s kitchen markets on Friday. Rohita sold for Tk 300–450 a kilogram and Katla for Tk 300–450 a kilogram, depending on size and quality. Pangas sold for Tk 200–230 a kilogram and Tilapia for Tk 220–230 a kilogram on Friday. The coarse variety of red lentil sold for Tk 105-110 a kilogram and the medium-quality variety for Tk 115–120 a kilogram on Friday.

Macron seeks new PM,"President Emmanuel Macron on Friday was holding talks with French political leaders on the left and right as he seeks to name a new prime minister and find a way out of France’s political crisis. Macron adopted a defiant tone in an address to the nation late Thursday, 24 hours after Prime Minister Michel Barnier’s government was ousted in a historic no-confidence vote. Macron vowed to name a new prime minister in the ‘coming days’, rejected growing pressure from the opposition to resign and blamed an ‘anti-republican front’ of the hard left and far right for France’s woes. Barnier — contemporary France’s shortest-serving premier—resigned after Wednesday’s parliamentary defeat in a standoff over the budget forced his government to step down, the first such toppling of a French administration in more than 60 years. ‘I will appoint a prime minister in the coming days,’ Macron said, adding that a ‘government of general interest’ would be formed to pass a budget. Barnier—who was only premier for three months—and his ministers will remain in charge on a caretaker basis until a new government is appointed. Macron is to meet leaders of the parliamentary factions of his own centrist forces, the Socialist Party and the right-wing Republicans Friday to continue the search for a compromise, presidential sources said. The hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) and far-right National Rally (RN) have not been invited to talks at this stage. Trying to limit political chaos is all the more important for Macron given that on Saturday he will host world leaders—including US President-elect Donald Trump—for the reopening of the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris after a devastating 2019 fire. Macron, who has long hoped to split the traditional Socialists from their pact with the LFI, received a boost when Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure said he was ready to negotiate with the president’s centrists and the right. Faure, who will meet Macron in the afternoon, told Franceinfo radio there should be ‘reciprocal concessions’ from all sides to form a new government and that he was ready for ‘compromise on all subjects’. But in a sign of how tough the road ahead could be, right-wing Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said the right would ‘make no compromise’ with the left, which he accused of betraying its principles in its pact with the LFI. A majority of lawmakers on Wednesday supported the no-confidence vote proposed by the hard left and backed by the far right headed by Marine Le Pen as well as the Socialists. Barnier’s ejection in record time came after snap parliamentary elections in June resulted in a hung parliament. No political force was able to form an overall majority and the far right held the key to the government’s survival. The trigger for Barnier’s ouster was his 2025 budget plan, including austerity measures unacceptable to a majority in parliament, but which were forced through without a vote using special powers. Barnier is Macron’s fifth prime minister since coming to power in 2017. Each successive premier has served for a shorter and shorter period. Given the composition of the National Assembly, there is no guarantee that Barnier’s successor will last any longer. Loyalist Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu and Macron’s centrist ally Francois Bayrou have been touted as possible contenders, as has former Socialist premier and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve. Constitutional rules means new legislative elections cannot be called until July. But while Macron has more than two years of his presidential term left, some opponents are calling on him to resign to break the deadlock. According to a poll by Odoxa-Backbone Consulting for Le Figaro daily, 59 percent of French people want the president to step down, while a survey by Harris for RTL put the figure even higher, at 64 percent. But Macron said: ‘The mandate that you gave to me democratically (in the 2022 elections) is a five-year mandate and I will exercise it fully, right up to the end.’ ‘The 30 months we have ahead of us must be 30 months of useful action for the country.’ On its Friday front page, the left-wing daily Liberation accused Macron of ‘flagrant denial’ of his responsibility in the crisis.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252161/macron-seeks-new-pm
Ship runs aground carrying Norwegian weapons for Poland,"A cargo ship loaded with Norwegian weapons destined to protect a Polish logistics hub that distributes military aid to Ukraine has run aground off Norway’s coast, authorities said Friday. The civilian vessel Finlandia Seaways was transporting some of the weapons Oslo announced Monday to protect the hub when it ran aground off southwestern Norway on Thursday. ‘The vessel hit a shoal and suffered damage to the rudder and propeller. It had to be tugged to a dock,’ a spokesman for the Sola rescue centre, Thomas Breivoll, told AFP. ‘There was nothing dramatic about it,’ he added. Norway’s defence ministry is sending F-35 jet fighters, NASAMS surface-to-air missiles and around 100 soldiers to protect the Rzeszow hub in Poland as part of a NATO member state rotation. A large part of Western military aid to Ukraine, which has been fending off Russia’s invasion since 2022, transits through the logistical hub in southeastern Poland. According to Hanne Olafsen, a spokeswoman for the Norwegian armed forces, the ship was transporting ‘elements of the anti-air materiel destined for Poland’. ‘This will undoubtedly lead to a slight delay’ in the contingent’s deployment, she told AFP. The military equipment will be transferred from the Finlandia Seaways to another vessel, and the area around the ship has been secured.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252160/ship-runs-aground-carrying-norwegian-weapons-for-poland

4 Taiwan soldiers charged with spying for China,"Four Taiwanese soldiers, including three from a unit in charge of security for the president’s office, were charged Friday for photographing and leaking confidential information to China, prosecutors and the president’s office said. China and Taiwan have been ruled separately since 1949, but Beijing insists the island is part of its territory and has vowed to seize it one day. There has been a series of spying cases in Taiwan, as China maintains military and political pressure on Taipei to accept its claims of sovereignty. In the latest case, the accused included three members of a military unit in charge of security for the Presidential Office, presidential spokesman Wen Lii said. A fourth person was a soldier in the defence ministry’s information and telecommunications command. They allegedly used their mobile phones to photograph military information, which was passed to ‘Chinese agents’, the Taipei district prosecutors office said. Lii condemned ‘any treasonous behaviour that harms the people and the country’. ‘China has long used various means to infiltrate, coerce and suppress our country, and intends to divide and destroy the hard-won democracy and freedoms of the Taiwanese people,’ Lii said in a statement. ‘Both soldiers and civilians must unite to protect our homeland. If an officer or soldier commits treason or betrayal of the people for personal selfish interests, it will be extremely disgraceful and should be severely condemned and punished by law.’ The four received payments ranging from around NT$260,000 to NT$660,000 ($8,000-$20,000) ‘depending on the confidentiality level of the military information they provided’, prosecutors said, without elaborating on the content of the material. The incidents happened from 2022 to 2024. Three of the soldiers were discharged before an investigation was launched in August this year following a tip-off to the defence ministry. The fourth was suspended in August. All four have been detained and charged with corruption and violating national security law for ‘leaking and delivering confidential information or electromagnetic records for China’. They face a maximum seven years in jail if convicted. ‘The Chinese Communist Party’s infiltration campaign against us has never stopped,’ the defence ministry said in a statement, describing the four accused as ‘treasonous and lawless’. ‘In order to actively prevent enemy espionage activities, the military will also continue its counter-intelligence education,’ it added. In September, an ex-air force instructor was sentenced to 17 years in prison for ‘aiding the enemy’ and delivering military secrets to China.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/252158/4-taiwan-soldiers-charged-with-spying-for-china
Hundreds in Chad call for French forces to leave,"Hundreds of people staged a rally in N’Djamena on Friday to support a Chad government call last week to scrap military cooperation with former colonial power France. Up to 500 people carrying placards that read ‘bar France’ gathered at the N’Djari stadium draped in the country’s colours, an AFP journalist said. ‘After 60 years of cooperation, we don’t need the French military, we have an army, we can defend our country,’ Abdel daim Abdallah Ousmane, secretary general of the Higher Council for Islamic Affairs, told AFP at the protest. ‘Our demonstration is peaceful. We are not France’s enemy and France is not an enemy of Chad,’ he added. The demonstration was approved by authorities. Rallies in the streets of the capital were forbidden, although authorities did not prevent small groups  gathering. A first demonstration of hundreds took place Thursday in the eastern commercial hub of Abeche, according to the Chad Infos public broadcaster. France has about 1,000 troops in its last military foothold in the Sahel. But Chad announced on November 28 a decision to end a defence accord with Paris mainly dating from independence in 1960. A special committee organised to oversee the ‘historic mission’ of ending the accord met for the first time Thursday, the prime minister’s office said in a statement. The end of the accord ‘marks a firm determination to regain sovereignty in national defence matters’, the statement said. It also reflects waning French influence in the region. France was forced in 2022 and 2023 to remove troops from Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger after military takeovers there that has seen the countries become closer to Russia. Chad’s leader General Mahamat Idriss Deby has also sought closer ties with Moscow in recent months, but talks to strengthen economic cooperation have yet to bear concrete results. The landlocked nation faces a potent threat from Boko Haram and other militant groups.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/252157/hundreds-in-chad-call-for-french-forces-to-leave
"Dozens arrested across UK, Ireland for trafficking","Police have arrested dozens of people in a cross-border crackdown against people-smuggling gangs exploiting free movement between the UK and Ireland, Britain’s interior ministry said Thursday. The crackdown “has led to the arrest of 35 people in multiple locations across the UK and Ireland,” the UK Home Office said in a statement. Immigration staff and police raided locations in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland as part of the three-day operation, it said. It targeted criminal groups exploiting the Common Travel Area (CTA) and abusing UK borders on all fronts, said the statement. The CTA allows British and Irish citizens only to travel without passports between the islands of Ireland, Great Britain, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. But it has sparked unease in Ireland amid allegations that migrants are using Belfast as a backdoor to the republic, and in the other direction into Britain. Earlier this year, after a surge in people applying for asylum in the republic, Dublin said most had come over the land border with Northern Ireland. The Home Office said that checks at major ports, airports, road networks and private addresses across the country had detected the gangs’ activities. Operating in the UK and internationally, they exploit vulnerable migrants, charging them thousands of pounds to enter the UK illegally, it added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252156/dozens-arrested-across-uk-ireland-for-trafficking
"India, Pakistan share climate challenges","Choking smog, scorching heat and ravaging floods—arch-rivals India and Pakistan share the same environmental challenges, offering a rare but unrealised opportunity for collaboration, according to experts. The neighbouring nations, which have fought three wars since their 1947 partition and still bitterly dispute Kashmir, are suffocated every winter by a haze of pollution traversing their border. The countries, together making up a fifth of the world’s population, frequently blame each other for smog blustering into their respective territories. But this year pollution reached record highs in Pakistan’s eastern and most populous province of Punjab, prompting the regional government to make a rare overture calling for ‘regional climate diplomacy’. India did not comment and whether they will unite to face a common foe remains to be seen. But experts agree the two countries cannot tackle climate threats in isolation. ‘We are geographically, environmentally and also culturally the same people and share the same climatic challenges,’ said Abid Omar, founder of the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative (PAQI). ‘We have to work transboundary,’ he told AFP. India and Pakistan are at the mercy of extreme weather which scientists say is increasing in frequency and severity, owing to climate change. Heatwaves have regularly surpassed 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit), droughts plague farmers and monsoon rains are becoming more intense. Pakistan’s 2022 monsoon floods submerged a third of the country and killed 1,700 people. A year later, more than 70 died in northeastern India when a mountain lake burst its banks, a phenomenon becoming more common as glaciers melt at higher rates. This July more than 200 people were killed in the southern Indian state of Kerala when monsoon downpours caused landslides that buried tea plantations under tonnes of rock and soil. In both countries, nearly half of people live below the poverty line, in a state of precarity where climate disasters can be devastating. ‘One would like to think that an urgent shared threat would bring the two sides together,’ Michael Kugelman, South Asia Institute director at the Washington-based Wilson Center, told AFP. ‘The problem is that this hasn’t.’ Each side has outlawed agricultural burning, a method to quickly clear crop waste ahead of the winter planting season, but farmers continue the practice because of a lack of cheap alternatives. Authorities in both countries have also threatened to destroy brick kilns that do not adhere to emissions regulations. But India, one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases, and Pakistan, one of the smallest, have never aligned their environmental laws, school or traffic closures, or shared technology and data. Indian economist and climate expert Ulka Kelkar highlighted the potential to collaborate on electric vehicle technology suited to South Asian needs. ‘In our countries, it’s two wheelers and three wheelers which most people tend to use,’ she told AFP. ‘So research and development of vehicular technologies, battery technologies that are suited for our road conditions, warmer climates, our passenger use—that’s the sort of discussion and common development that can happen.’ Experts say the geopolitical rivalry runs so deep that distrust undercuts any prospects of cooperation. Visas are so sparingly granted that most researchers in one of the countries cannot visit the other, whilst Islamabad and New Delhi frequently poke holes in one another’s data. The PAQI partnered with an Indian counterpart in 2019 to reconcile findings by installing matching air pollution sensors in each other’s countries. While breathing toxic air has catastrophic health consequences—with the World Health Organization warning that strokes, heart disease, lung cancer and respiratory diseases can be triggered by prolonged exposure—the one-year project was not renewed. The nations do hold regular discussions on one critical climate issue: sharing rights to the Indus River which bisects Pakistan but is fed by tributaries in India. However geopolitical posturing in September saw New Delhi lobby Islamabad for a review of their water-sharing treaty, citing cross-border militant attacks, according to Indian media. But the impetus for cooperation will only increase. India and Pakistan both have exploding population growth rates. ‘Being developing economies, there is a growing use of electricity and fossil fuels for industry, for transportation, for urban use,’ economist Kelkar said. At a national level, experts also say there may be a crucial imbalance between the two countries. ‘Climate-related problems tend to be transnational by nature’, Indian international relations expert Kanishkan Sathasivam said. ‘India can do certain things for Pakistan but Pakistan is not going to have much that it can do for India,’ he added, explaining that India’s gross domestic product was 10 times larger than its neighbour’s in 2023. Pakistan was also on the brink of default last year, only saved from bankruptcy by international loans, and is burdened by debt repayments preventing investment to counteract climate challenges. India, meanwhile, has taken more proactive measures such as banning petrol-powered vehicles older than 15 years from driving on the streets of its capital. But unilateral measures do not address the root cause. ‘The dialogue and the trust has to be built up through many mechanisms,’ said Omar of PAQI. ‘It should not be limited to government to government discussions, but also between the science and academic community.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/252155/india-pakistan-share-climate-challenges
Turkey becomes OSCE head after tense Malta talks,"The OSCE, the world’s largest regional security organisation, agreed Friday on Turkish diplomat Feridun Sinirlioglu as its next leader, after a meeting imarred by outrage over Russia’s participation. The 57-nation Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has been paralysed since Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and has been without a secretary general since September. Ian Borg, Malta’s foreign minister, told reporters the OSCE faced ‘fundamental geopolitical divisions and institutional paralysis’. He said the agreement on a new secretary general and three other top posts had been ‘no easy feat’ but hailed it as proof members could come together. Borg did not rule out a deal on the budget—which has not been agreed since 2021 -- by the end of the year. Sinirlioglu, who has served as foreign minister and as Turkey’s ambassador to Israel and the United Nations, said he hoped to act as ‘a bridge and a facilitator’ between participating states. Sinirlioglu, who takes over from Germany’s Helga Maria Schmid, also called on Russia to release three OSCE officials held in Russian-controlled Ukraine since 2022. The Malta meeting was dominated by criticism of Russia, represented by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, on his first trip to a European Union country since the invasion. Ukraine boycotted last year’s OSCE meeting in North Macedonia over Lavrov’s presence. Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga was present in Malta, but he and several allies walked out during Lavrov’s address. Poland has led calls for Russia to be excluded from the OSCE, but Borg said it was vital to keep talking. ‘I’d rather have the other... (members) telling Russia on the same table to stop this war,’ he said. ‘It’s easy to discuss and agree amongst friends,’ he added, but it was important also, ‘especially with the backdrop of raging wars, to engage with those who started and can stop the war immediately.’ Malta took the 2025 chairmanship at the last minute after Russia blocked NATO member Estonia. Finland, which joined NATO last year, is chair for 2025. The OSCE was founded in 1975 to ease East-West tensions during the Cold War, and now counts members from the United States to Mongolia. It helps coordinate issues such as human rights and arms control, but Moscow has accused the group of being politicised by the EU and NATO.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252154/turkey-becomes-osce-head-after-tense-malta-talks
Russia says ready to defend by ‘any means’,"Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday said he hoped Ukraine’s allies took ‘seriously’ Moscow’s recent use of a hypersonic missile in the conflict there, and warned that Russia was ready to use ‘any means’ to defend itself. The United States and its allies ‘must understand that we would be ready to use any means not to allow them to succeed in what they call strategic defeat of Russia,’ Lavrov said in an interview with US media personality Tucker Carlson. Two weeks ago, Russia fired its new Oreshnik hypersonic missile on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro in an escalation of the almost three-year war. Russian president Vladimir Putin has since threatened to use the weapon on Kyiv in response to Ukraine’s strikes on Russia’s territory, which took place after the United States authorized use of its ATACMS weapon system in such attacks. ‘We are sending signals and we hope that the last one, a couple of weeks ago, the signal with the new weapons system called Oreshnik... was taken seriously,’ Lavrov said. While he insisted that Russia does not want to escalate the situation and wants to ‘avoid any misunderstanding’ with Washington and its partners, Lavrov warned that ‘we will send additional messages if they don’t draw necessary conclusions.’ Putin said the Oreshnik missile flies at 10 times the speed of sound and cannot be intercepted by air defenses. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has called the strike ‘the latest bout of Russian madness’ and appealed for updated air-defense systems to meet the new threat. In the wide-ranging interview, Lavrov accused the United States of attempting to bully Russia and others on the international stage. On Ukraine, he said Moscow was ‘ready for any eventuality but we strongly prefer peaceful solution through negotiations on the basis of respecting legitimate security interests of Russia.’ Describing what such a peace deal could look like, the top Russian diplomat said, among other demands, Kyiv would have to accept Russia’s claim of control over the regions of Donetsk, Kherson, Lugansk and Zaporizhzhia. ‘They are now part of the Russian Federation according to the constitution and this is a reality,’ he said. He accused US president Joe Biden’s administration of escalating the conflict in Ukraine ‘to leave a legacy to the Trump administration as bad as they can.’ Lavrov described US President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office in January and has vowed to swiftly end the war without explaining how he would do so, as a ‘strong person.’ ‘I think he’s a very strong person, a person who wants results, who doesn’t like procrastination on anything,’ he said. He described Israel’s punishing military offensive in Gaza as inflicting ‘collective punishment, which is against international humanitarian law,’ on Palestinians. Lavrov said Moscow was ‘very much concerned’ with a recent escalation of violence in Syria, where armed rebel groups have seized swathes of territory from the government of Bashar al-Assad, a Russian regional ally. He said he planned to hold talks on Friday with Turkish and Iranian officials on the situation in Syria. Carlson, a former Fox News host, is a right-wing journalist who is a key ally of Trump, and earlier this year was the first US journalist to interview Putin since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The media provocateur has spent years depicting the United States as a nation in decline, under assault by Democrats, so-called ‘woke’ protesters and communism. He has increasingly promoted right-wing conspiracy theories since leaving Fox.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252153/russia-says-ready-to-defend-by-any-means
49 Indian media outlets spread fake news about Bangladesh,"A Bangladeshi fact-checking platform said on Friday that it identified India-based 49 media outlets that spread fake news reports relating to 13 issues on Bangladesh between August 12 and December 5. Among them, Republic Bangla led the list, broadcasting fake news reports centring five issues alone. Hindustan Times, Zee News, and Live Mint followed closely, each spreading fake news reports relating to three issues. Additionally, Republic, India Today, ABP Anand, and Aaj Tak each broadcast fake news reports on two issues. Rumor Scanner, an independent fact checking platform, found that the remaining 41 media outlets each broadcast fake news reports on one issue. Some of the media outlets published the same fake news over days, the fact-checking platform said. The Indian media started spreading fake news targeting Bangladesh after the fall of Sheikh Hasina on August 5 through a student-led mass uprising. The Indian media claimed that Sheikh Hasina issued an open letter from Delhi, blaming the United States for her fall. It was later revealed that the ousted prime minister had not issued any such letter. A Rumor Scanner investigation found that the letter had first spread on Facebook and later Agartala-based daily Tripura Bhobishyot in its print edition published the letter with a date on it. Following this, screenshots of the letter were widely shared on social media and also broadcast by several media outlets in both India and Bangladesh. After August 5, a video clip spread across various Indian media outlets, claiming that a Hindu man organised a human chain demanding recovery of his missing son. The real fact on the clip revealed that the man was actually a Muslim named Babul Howlader. The human chain was organised in an effort to trace his son who went missing in 2013. In another fake report, the Indian media outlets claimed that chief adviser to the interim government Professor Muhammad Yunus was admitted to the intensive care unit in critical condition. A photo of a patient receiving treatment in a hospital was also published alongside the claim. Investigations revealed that it was not Yunus’ photo. In fact, it was neither recent nor from Bangladesh. Yunus is, in fact, in good health. Following Donald Trump’s victory in the United States presidential election on November 5, in another false claim, fake news spread across the Indian media that Muhammad Yunus had fled to France. The photo used as evidence of his escape was actually taken on August 8, when Yunus was returning from France to Bangladesh. On November 13, for the first time since independence, a container-carrying ship docked at the Chittagong port directly from Karachi, Pakistan. Indian media outlets claimed that the ship was the same Pakistani military vessel ‘Swat’ which had brought arms and ammunition to then Chittagong during the 1971 War of Independence. They further alleged that the ship was carrying weapons from Pakistan to Bangladesh. A Rumor Scanner investigation found the ship’s name MV Yuan Xiang Fa Zhan, a commercial vessel that brought industrial raw materials and consumer goods to Bangladesh. On November 25, the Detective Branch of Police arrested Hindu leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport are on the charges of disrespecting the national flag. The following day he was presented before a Chattogram court that denied him bail. Tension rose on the court premises, and as authorities attempted to escort Chinmoy to a prison van for transfer to jail, his supporters began protesting. The police and Border Guard Bangladesh charged batons and hurled sound grenades to disperse the demonstrators. During the clashes, Chattogram district court lawyer Saiful Islam Alif was killed. But Indian media outlets falsely claimed that Saiful was murdered because he was Chinmoy’s lawyer. Chinmoy’s lawyer was Subhashish Sharma, not Saiful Islam. Some Indian media outlets also falsely claimed that the broadcast of Indian satellite channels were shut down in Bangladesh. The Indian media also falsely reported that the Bangladesh Air Force, with China’s technical assistance, was planning to build Asia’s second-largest airbase at Lalmonirhat airport near the Siliguri Corridor, also known as the Chicken’s Neck, a narrow stretch of land bordering Bangladesh. The Lalmonirhat airport has been closed for over six decades, and no recent initiatives are there to resume its operations. Recently, a video clip claiming that Muslims in Bangladesh attacked a Hindu temple and vandalised idols spread online and promoted by some Indian media outlets. The Rumor Scanner team found that the video was not from Bangladesh but from the village of Sultanpur in East Burdwan district, India, showing a scene of idol immersion. In another instance of false publishing and broadcasting false news, some Indian media outlets claimed in reports that a collision between a Shyamoli Paribahan bus and a Bangladeshi truck on the Dhaka-Agartala-Dhaka route in Brahmanbaria was intentional. The news also claimed that local people had given life threats to the Indian passengers aboard the bus and chanted anti-India slogans. The Rumor Scanner team found the accident occurred due to overtaking, and not intentionally, while no evidence of threats or anti-India slogans were found either. Some Indian news outlets claimed that the UK had issued a travel advisory warning of potential terror attacks in Bangladesh for its citizens, which was found misleading by the Rumor Scanner.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/252152/49-indian-media-outlets-spread-fake-news-about-bangladesh

BNP leader Rizvi accuses India of using communalism to assert dominance,"Bangladesh Nationalist Party senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi on Friday accused India of using communalism as a pretext to establish dominance in the subcontinent by provoking hardline Hindu groups. ‘You divided India by using communalism as a pretext, and now you are also destroying the democratic traditions India has maintained since its independence,’ he said while addressing an event in the capital’s Gulshan area, which called for a boycott of Indian products. ‘By using communalism as a pretext, you are trying to establish dominance in the subcontinent by inciting radical Hindus,’ the BNP leader added. He observed that Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Pakistan were no longer aligned with India due to its hateful and malicious approach. ‘Bangladesh is also not with you. This is solely because of your arrogance and the exploitative attitude you continue to demonstrate,’ Rizvi said. He said Bangladesh is a self-sufficient nation, which achieved its independence through the sacrifice of three million lives and the loss of dignity of 200,000 women. ‘Can you suppress this country of 18-19 crore people by simply frowning your eyes and frightening us with false propaganda? What has happened to you that you have suddenly started desperately spreading propaganda against Bangladesh?’ the BNP leader asked. Before August 5, he said, a despised government under Sheikh Hasina was in power in Bangladesh, one that did not hesitate to kill children in the country to cling to power. ‘They did not hesitate to make their own people, who love democracy, disappear forever. They used to kill people along the rivers and canals through crossfire. Why was that Hasina government so dear to you? Because, with your provocation, Sheikh Hasina did whatever she wanted in this country,’ Rizvi added. He mentioned that India may think the people of Bangladesh would face great problems if it stopped exporting onions, garlic, ginger, and soybean oil. ‘Don’t forget, the people of Bangladesh are hardworking and they know how to produce onions, garlic, and ginger themselves. You think you are the only country in the world. Are there no other countries from which we can import onions, garlic, and oil?’ Rizvi said. He also reminded India that the people of Bangladesh had built cattle and goat farms in every village and slaughtered 1.20 crore cattle in a single Eid, following India’s cessation of cattle exports for five to six years. The BNP leader said that shopkeepers at Kolkata’s New Market and other areas, along with hospitals there, are facing difficulties as India has stopped issuing visas to Bangladeshis. ‘You have stopped issuing visas, thinking that the people of Bangladesh would become restless. The people of Bangladesh are happy. If necessary, they will go to Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, or any other country. People do not want to go to a country like India, which harbours a hatred towards us,’ he said. The BNP leader also criticised Indian Republic Bangla TV for claiming that Chattogram was part of India, warning that Bangladesh would also claim ownership of areas such as Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, once ruled by Muslim Nawabs.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252149/bnp-leader-rizvi-accuses-india-of-using-communalism-to-assert-dominance
BNP accuses India of trying to destabilise govt,"The Bangladesh Nationalist Party said on Friday that India was trying to destabilise the interim government of Bangladesh by creating chaos in the country. India is trying to destabilise the interim government, BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said, adding that no country would succeed in hatching a conspiracy against 18 crore united people of Bangladesh. He came up with the remarks while addressing a discussion organised by pro-BNP student leaders of Dhaka University Central Students’ Union and All Party Students Unity of the 90s at the National Press Club  marking Fall of Autocracy Day. He said that India and some Hindu community members here were now creating problems to defame the people of the country and tarnish its image. ‘Their only goal is to create chaos and try to make the interim government fail,’ said Mosharraf. On December 6, 1990, military dictator Hussain Mohammad Ershad was forced to resign in the face of a mass upsurge and handed power over to a caretaker government, ending his nine years of autocratic rule which began with a coup on March 24, 1982. The BNP leader said that various conspiracies were being hatched over religious minority issues in the country. ‘The people of the Hindu community have not been living in the country for only three months, but they have been living here since independence in great harmony,’ he added. Mosharraf also urged all country people, regardless of religion or caste, to confront all conspiracies. He further said that the people of Bangladesh had repeatedly changed the government through mass uprisings. ‘So there is no scope to undermine the people of this country. The people will decide what their government will be and how they will run the country,’ he said. He said that the country’s people, regardless of all religions, must unite in maintaining peace and move towards the development of the country. Mosharraf urged the government to give priority to a prompt reform of the election system and come up with an election roadmap. BNP senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, meanwhile, accused India of using communalism as a pretext for establishing dominance in the subcontinent by provoking hardline Hindus. He came up with the remarks while addressing an event in the capital’s Gulshan, which called for a boycott of Indian products.

Dhaka continues to be the most polluted city,"Dhaka, the overcrowded capital city of Bangladesh, has ranked the first on the list of cities with the worst air quality with an AQI score of 242 at about 9:00am on Friday morning. Friday’s air was classified as ‘unhealthy’, according to the AQI index. When the AQI value for particle pollution is between 50 and 100, air quality is considered ‘moderate’, usually sensitive individuals should consider limiting prolonged outdoor exertion, between 101 and 150, air quality is considered ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’, between 150 and 200 is ‘unhealthy’, between 201 and 300 is said to be ‘very unhealthy’, while a reading of 301 and above is considered ‘hazardous’, posing serious health risks to residents. Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City, Pakistan’s Karachi and Lahore respectively occupied the second, third and fourth spots on the list, with AQI scores of 190, 186 and 186 respectively. The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. The AQI in Bangladesh is based on five pollutants: particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon. As per World Health Organisation, air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, mainly due to increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/environment-climate-change/252142/dhaka-continues-to-be-the-most-polluted-city

SC allows Ashiyan city to resume housing activities,"The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on Thursday allowed Ashiyan Group to resume its housing project on 33 acres (100 bighas) of land in the Dakkhin Khan at Ashkona in Dhaka. This decision pertains to a portion of the 230-acre disputed land, resolving a 12-year legal battle between Ashiyan and rights groups. A six-member bench, led by chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, dismissed two petitions filed by Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha and eight rights organisations. The petitions sought a review of the Appellate Division’s November 22, 2023, verdict that upheld the legality of Ashiyan’s project. The conflict began in 2012 when eight rights groups, including Ain O Salish Kendra, Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, and Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon, filed a writ petition challenging Ashiyan’s development on wetlands, agricultural land, and flood flow zones. The groups alleged illegal earth-filling, land grabbing, and environmental destruction across 230 acres. In August 2016, the High Court declared the project lawful after reviewing its earlier 2014 verdict, which deemed the housing scheme illegal. The Appellate Division’s recent decision has now reinforced the project’s legality over 33 acres but left the remaining land in question. Ashiyan’s project has faced strong opposition from environmental groups, citing the 2009 Appellate Division ruling that declared illegal the Modhumoti Model Town project for similar encroachments on wetlands and floodplains. The Department of Environment also fined Ashiyan Tk 50 lakh in 2011 for altering wetlands, destroying farmland, graveyards, and the Ashkona-Kaola canal. Rights group lawyer Fida M Kamal argued that the project violated laws protecting wetlands, agricultural land, and flood flow zones, leading to irreversible ecological damage and the displacement of rural communities. Ashiyan’s lawyer, Ahsanul Karim, argued before the Appellate Division that the company should not be singled out when other developers, such as Bashundhara, Jamuna Builders, and NASA Group, were also constructing projects on wetlands. He stated that Ashiyan could legally proceed with development on the approved 33-acre plot but acknowledged the lack of Rajuk approval for the remaining disputed land. Ahsanul Karim emphasised that the law would determine the fate of the unapproved areas, which remain under scrutiny. The petitioners contended that Ashiyan could produce documentation for only 41 acres out of the 230 acres under development. They accused the company of illegally filling wetlands, damaging ecosystems, and destroying livelihoods. While the Appellate Division verdict clears a partial path for Ashiyan City, it leaves unresolved the broader environmental and legal implications of large-scale housing projects encroaching on ecologically sensitive areas.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252139/sc-allows-ashiyan-city-to-resume-housing-activities
Bangladesh president seeks more Malaysian investment,"President Mohammed Shahabuddin has urged Malaysian investors to come up with more invests in various sectors, including Special Economic Zones, in Bangladesh.

Law adviser urged to strengthen NHRC,"Asian NGO Network on National Human Rights Institutions and Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development on Thursday in a joint letter urged the interim government’s law, justice, and parliamentary affairs adviser to strengthen the National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh. The law adviser was also urged to ensure a transparent process for selecting new commissioners and amending the NHRC Act, said the letter signed by Forum-Asia executive director Mary Aileen D Bacalso. The NHRC leadership has been vacant since the resignation of all its members on November 7, 2024, said the letter. It said that as the Interim government sought to fill these positions, it must take necessary steps to ensure the formalisation of a fair, clear, transparent, and participatory selection process. The letter also said that the principles of pluralism and independence from government interference must be respected in the selection of the NHRC’s decision-making body. ‘We urge the government to ensure that the new commissioners are diverse in composition, reflecting gender balance and the representation of religious and national minorities,’ said the letter. ‘We also take this opportunity to advocate for the reform of the National Human Rights Commission Act of 2009 (NHRC Act),’ the letter added. According to the Paris Principles, a functioning and effective NHRI should have a broad mandate to investigate all alleged human rights violations, including those involving the authorities and security forces, the letter said. ‘We remind the interim government that the NHRC should be legally prescribed to exercise a broad mandate, powers, and functions as Bangladesh navigates a period of transition,’ the letter added.

Rickelton hits maiden Test ton for South Africa against Sri Lanka,"Ryan Rickelton made a battling century as South Africa overcame a shaky start on the first day of the second Test against Sri Lanka at St George's Park on Thursday. The left-handed Rickelton hit 101 as South Africa reached 269 for seven at the close. Rickelton, 28, has been a peripheral figure in the South African Test team since making his debut two-and-a-half years ago. He was playing in only his eighth Test out of a possible 19 and came into the match with a highest score of 42. ‘It's a lot of relief more than anything,’ said Rickelton. ‘I take a lot of pride in my cricket and have always felt I could play at this level.’ But making a significant mark on the game had proved elusive. ‘I've been around this team for a period of time. I've been in and I've been out in all formats. To tick it off for myself is probably the most important thing.’ Having ‘jumped at the opportunity to bat at three’, Rickelton had to face the eighth ball of the match after Tony de Zorzi was leg before wicket to Asitha Fernando without a run on the board. South Africa slumped to 44 for three against aggressive Sri Lankan bowling before Rickelton and in-form captain Temba Bavuma (78) added 133 for the fourth wicket with Bavuma dominating the scoring. ‘Temba is playing incredibly well at the moment. He was stroking it nicely and it took a lot of pressure off me.’ Bavuma, who made 70 and 113 in South Africa's win in the first Test, gloved a catch to wicketkeeper Kusal Mendis off Asitha Fernando when Sri Lanka opted to attack the batsmen with short-pitched bowling. David Bedingham was dropped twice off short balls from Fernando before he was bowled by left-arm spinner Prabath Jayasuriya for six. Rickelton, though, was content to duck under the barrage of bouncers. ‘The bounce was a bit inconsistent. I decided I wasn't going to give it away. I was willing to take some hits on the body.’ Rickelton and Kyle Verreynne (48 not out) rebuilt the innings with a sixth-wicket stand of 77 before Rickelton and Marco Jansen fell in the space of seven balls against the second new ball shortly before the close. Rickelton, normally a free-flowing batsman, batted patiently, reaching his fifty off 121 balls and his century off 231 deliveries. He added only one more run before jabbing Lahiru Kumara to Pathum Nissanka at gully. Kumara, who reached the milestone of 100 Test wickets when he bowled Aiden Markram for 20, took three for 54 as he and his fellow fast bowlers kept the batsmen under pressure for much of the day. ‘We bowled in good areas,’ said Kumara. ‘There was hardly any help on the wicket, so we had to rely on good lines and lengths. There's a bit of help with the new ball but as the ball gets older we have to work hard.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252129/rickelton-hits-maiden-test-ton-for-south-africa-against-sri-lanka

No innocent person will be harassed,’ he said. He made these remarks while replying to a series of questions at a press conference, organised at the police headquarters. ‘Many cases have been filed in the wake of the anti-discrimination movement. We will investigate the actual incident and submit a charge sheet or final report to the court,’ he said. Baharul said that they would not make indiscriminate arrest without valid reason or investigation. They were trying to restore the morale of the police force and infuse a desire in them to go to the people. ‘We are working to gain the confidence of the people in police force.

INDIA bloc MPs protest over Adani indictment issue,"Leaders from various parties of the INDIA bloc took to the streets wearing black jackets with bold stickers reading ‘Modi Adani Ek Hai’ (Modi and Adani are one) and ‘Adani Safe Hai’ (Adani is safe). This act was aimed at drawing attention to their demands regarding the on-going Adani issue, reports The Indian Express. The protesters, including members from Congress, TMC, AAP and other opposition parties, were seen raising slogans and calling for a joint parliamentary committee probe into the allegations against the Adani Group. They argued that there is a need for a thorough investigation into the business dealings and financial practices surrounding the conglomerate, especially in light of claims regarding its links to prime minister Narendra Modi and the government. Congress MPs, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, along with lawmakers from other opposition parties such as RJD and the Left, participated in a protest. Both Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi called for a parliamentary discussion on the indictment of Adani in a US court on charges of bribery and fraud, urging prime minister Narendra Modi to address the issue in the House. The protest was held in front of the Makar Dwar steps of Parliament, not the usual steps leading to it, as per an advisory from the Lok Sabha Secretariat and speaker Om Birla. Later, the protesting MPs gathered in front of the Samvidhan Sadan, raising slogans against Modi and Adani. The Lok Sabha Secretariat had issued a directive on Tuesday advising MPs not to protest in front of Parliament gates, warning that such actions could obstruct movement and jeopardize safety and security. Opposition MPs had staged protests at Makar Dwar on both Tuesday and Wednesday. The Trinamool Congress distanced itself from the protests against Adani. Congress and other opposition parties are demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee inquiry following Adani’s indictment and the involvement of other company officials. The Congress party stated that Adani’s indictment ‘vindicates’ their demand for a JPC investigation into various alleged scams involving the Adani Group. Rahul Gandhi has called for Adani’s immediate arrest, while the Adani Group has denied all allegations, labelling them as ‘baseless.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/252127/india-bloc-mps-protest-over-adani-indictment-issue
"Assam bans consumption of beef in hotels, public places","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Wednesday announced a statewide ban on serving and consumption of beef in restaurants, hotels and public places, reports NDTV. The decision, sources said, was taken at a state cabinet meeting to amend the existing law on beef consumption to incorporate the new provisions. Consumption of beef is not illegal in Assam, but The Assam Cattle Preservation Act of 2021 regulates the transportation, and slaughter of all cattle, and sale of beef and beef products in the state. ‘We had earlier introduced a bill in Assam to protect cows and we have been successful,’ Sarma said, referring to the legislation that was approved by the state assembly in 2021. ‘Going further, we have decided that beef will not be served in any hotels or restaurants in the state. It will also not be served during any public function or in any public place,’ he added. The Assam Cattle Preservation Act of 2021 bans cattle slaughter and sale of beef in areas where Hindus, Jains and Sikhs are in majority and within a five kilometre radius of a temple or satra (Vaishnavite monastery). ‘Earlier, we had decided to place the curbs within a five kilometre radius of a temple but now, we have decided to expand it to other areas,’ the chief minister said. The opposition All India United Democratic Front hit out at the state government, accusing it of diverting attention from key issues. ‘The state government has failed to carry out development works it has failed to tackle unemployment. There are major issues in the education and health sector they are simply diverting the people’s attention through such decisions,’ AIUDF legislator Aminul Islam said. The Assam Cattle Preservation Bill was passed in the Assam Assembly through a voice vote in August 2021, amid a walkout from the opposition, who wanted the legislation to be sent to a Select Committee for a detailed discussion.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/252126/assam-bans-consumption-of-beef-in-hotels-public-places
"Demands for accountable, apolitical force grow louder","Several thousand citizens through an opinion platform have said that they expect reforms in the police force that will transform it to an apolitical, corruption-free and accountable force that would not repress citizens by abuse of power. The public expectations have been reflected in an online public opinion survey conducted between October 31 and November 15 by the recently-formed Police Reform Commission, gathering more than 24,000 responses. The commission said that more than 70 per cent respondents in the survey also voiced for an immediate end to the use of the force on political purposes, administrative and legal procedures to stop misuse of power to favour corruption, making police accountable in cases of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings, and the establishment of a permanent complaint commission. More than one commission members recently told New Age that a common highlight of the recommendations made by the respondents was putting an end to arbitrary detention and extrajudicial treatment of detainees. According to the summery of the survey, more than 80 per cent of the respondents wanted effective steps to check bribery for getting release from false cases. Supplementing the public opinions, retired police officers suggested that police reform must align with proper democratic practices, involve revisions to colonial-era laws and regulations, and foster a cultural shift within the police force. On October 31, the police reform commission launched an online survey featuring 17 questions, inviting responses by November 15. Commission member ASM Nasiruddin Elan said, ‘The majority of the responses emphasised freeing Bangladesh Police from political influence.’ Eliminating corruption within the police at all levels, from recruitment to retirement came as a major recommendation. Another significant recommendation was to revise Sections 54 and 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure pertaining to detention and investigation processes. On October 3, the interim government established a full-fledged police reform commission alongside five others, following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government on August 5, triggered by violent police actions against anti-fascist protesters. The police face widespread allegations of using ‘excessive’ force in applying lethal weapons that killed around 1,500 people and injured more than 30,000 people during the July-August student-led mass uprising. To gather post-uprising public perceptions in an organised way, the commission’s survey asked respondents about their expectations of the police, exploring traits, such as people-friendliness, accountability, neutrality, efficiency, modernity, respect for human rights, and freedom from political influence and corruption. The survey also sought opinions on urgent reform priorities, offering options such as modernising laws and regulations, ensuring accountability for human rights violations, including arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings, curbing abuse of power and corruption, and improving the salaries and benefits of lower-ranking force members. Beyond the survey’s scope, former inspector general of Bangladesh Police Nurul Huda advocated for replacing the Police Act of 1861, describing it as incompatible with a democratic society. ‘Police a legally empowered coercive organisation. There must be an apolitical regulatory body to hold the force accountable if their use of coercion exceeds reasonable limits,’ Nurul said, highlighting the ‘disproportionate’ force employed during the 2024 uprising to serve vested political interests. To that end, he proposed the establishment of an apolitical public safety or complaint commission to hold the police accountable for extrajudicial actions. He also said that a democratic society’s police force requires constitutional protection to resist political influence. Nurul further called for clarity in defining the police’s role, as it is variably referred to as a law enforcement agency, a disciplined force and a civil force under different regulations. Retired additional deputy inspector general Md Mazharul Haque stressed that democracy in politics is critical to transforming the police into a true civil force. ‘Citizens’ voting rights must be upheld. Moreover, the police force should be reformed to ensure accountability to voters and citizens for any disproportionate or improper actions,’ Mazharul said. Abu Momtaz Saad Uddin Ahmed, member secretary of the police reform commission and an additional secretary at the public security division, recently said, ‘We will engage all stakeholders to discuss and analyse the findings. The commission is committed to preparing a comprehensive reform plan to ensure that post-uprising Bangladesh establishes a citizen-centric police force.’ He added that the commission was reaching out to all tiers of the police force to gather their perspectives on reform.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252125/demands-for-accountable-apolitical-force-grow-louder
Unchecked corruption puts food security at risk,"Unbridled corruption particularly in areas related to the agriculture sector has left the country’s food security in peril, the ‘White Paper on the state of Bangladesh economy’ has observed. The much-talked-about paper has highlighted corruption among eight major reasons which have handicapped the agriculture sector that contributes nearly 14 per cent to the gross domestic product and provides jobs for over 40 per cent of the workforce. The sector, feeding the country’s 172 million people, had struggled with growing corruption during the 15-year regime of the now ousted Awami League, while at the same time encountered the challenges of low labour productivity, stagnating growth in production, limited access to finance, and fertiliser shortages. An example of scandalous corruption is the Tk 3,020 crore ‘Mechanisation of agriculture work through integrated management’ project adopted for distributing 51,300 units of agro-machinery over a 2020–2025 period to increase productivity. But eventually allegations of massive theft of project fund by businesses and officials had surfaced surrounding the distribution of agricultural machinery, says the white paper, mentioning that millions of dollars were stolen by kleptocrats of the Awami League regime before it was finally overthrown on August 5 amid a student-led mass uprising. The country lost $16 billion annually on an average between 2009 and 2023 because of the illicit fund flow amid systemic tax evasion, misuse of exemptions, and poorly managed public finances, according to the paper. Income tax exemptions were granted to selected large conglomerates, including the Summit Group, for its liquefied natural gas terminal and 15 power plants, S Alam Group for its coal-based power plants, and BEXIMCO Group for its Sukuk Bond, according to the white paper. Public money worth $14–24 billion was lost to political extortion, bribery, and inflated budgets with the annual development programme projects worth $60 billion in the past 15 years, said the Whiter Paper prepared by a 12-memebr  committee led by economist Debapriya Bhattacharya. Regarding the agriculture sector, the paper said that the Anti-Corruption Commission launched an investigation into allegations of irregularities linked to the farm mechanisation project in 2023 after the government’s Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division brought fund embezzlement allegations. An initiative to provide 50 per cent of the total loan earmarked for the small and medium enterprises to cottage, micro, and small enterprises linked to agriculture by 2024 to boost agricultural production and rural incomes was also abused, reveals the paper. The White Paper notes that political leaders and corrupt bureaucrats have exploited the agriculture sector as a means to legalise their illegal wealth. A notable example of this is allegations against a former Inspector General of Police who reportedly had amassed significant wealth and ‘legalised’ part of it through investments in fisheries and received the ‘Integrity Award’ of the Government in 2020–21, the white paper mentions. On the fertiliser distribution system, the white paper mentions that corruption by the government dealers led to a 59 per cent reduction in the marginal productivity of fertiliser during the Amon season, and a 18 per cent reduction in the Boro season. Such fertiliser scams had disproportionately affected the marginal farmers than the well-to-do farmers, highlighting the detrimental impact of corruption on those already vulnerable. The paper has also revealed corruption in the disbursement of agricultural credits. In 2016–17, the government distributed nearly Tk 17,600 crore as agricultural loan of which nearly 6.82 per cent was spent as bribe to bank officials. Nearly 54 per cent of the credit was actually used in agriculture, said the paper. On the public rice procurement policy, the White Paper said that in 2019 the farmers sold only 25.8 per cent of the procurement target to the Directorate General of Food as they were not adequately informed of the government’s rice procurement system. In 2020, the Anti-Corruption Commission suspected use of bribes and extortions in the rice procurement schemes, the White Paper said, while also asked the government for decisive action to hold corrupt officials accountable for scam in the agriculture mechanisation project. The interim government appointed the 12-member committee for the formulation of a White Paper on the state of Bangladesh economy on August 29. The committee submitted its report to the chief adviser on December 1.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252124/unchecked-corruption-puts-food-security-at-risk
"Bangladesh mission heads from Kolkata, Agartala asked to return home","Bangladesh Deputy High Commission in Kolkata’s acting mission chief Sikder Mohammad Ashrafur Rahman has returned home and met foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain on Thursday as part of ‘consultations.’ Assistant High Commissioner in Tripura Arifur Rahman was also scheduled to return home following the recent incidents in Kolkata and Agartala, said a diplomatic source. Tensions between Bangladesh and India escalated following Monday’s attack by a Hindu religious group on the Bangladesh mission in Agartala, Tripura, prompting the Bangladesh Foreign Ministry to summon the Indian High Commissioner for a formal protest. Amid the evolving situation, Bangladesh authorities on Tuesday suspended all visa and consular services at the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala. The government of Bangladesh said it ‘deeply resents’ the ‘violent demonstration and attack’ by a large group of protesters of the Hindu Sangharsh Samity of Agartala on the premises of the Assistant High Commission of Bangladesh in Agartala. Foreign affairs mknistry, in a statement, underlined that this ‘heinous attack’ on a diplomatic mission of Bangladesh and desecration of the national flag of Bangladesh comes in a pattern, further to a similar violent demonstration in Kolkata on November 28, 2024. ‘It is very clear that we want good relations, but it should be reciprocal. We need to work to that end,’ Adviser Hossain told reporters while responding to a question at the foreign ministry on Wednesday.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/252123/bangladesh-mission-heads-from-kolkata-agartala-asked-to-return-home
White Paper finds systematic corruption in health sector,"The White Paper on the State of Bangladesh Economy finds rampant systematic corruption in health sector through procurement and supply chain management, outsourcing of services, and career mobility of young doctors. Corruption was also reported in connection with pharmaceuticals, diagnostics tests, private hospitals, and through appointments, promotions, transfer, leave permission of doctors and health professionals. On December 1, a 12-member committee headed by economist Debapriya Bhattacharya submitted the report to the interim government chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus. The interim government formed the committee on August 29 following taking over power on August 8 after the fall of the longest serving prime minister Sheikh Hasina in a student-led peoples uprising on August 5. According to the paper, the Directorate General of Health Services has more than 60 procurement entities under its umbrella. The DGHS oversees the procurement of various medical and non-medical commodities essential for healthcare provision. In this system of procurement, the health related products are being bought through open tender where, allegedly, the corruption is rampant. There are instances where the under-the-table dealing is to receive less/quality compromised products that are not at par as specified in the tenders. Deployment of human resources to clean and run a hospital with health workers, ‘outsourcing’ of such service deliveries in public hospitals, community clinics have been introduced. There has been allegedly widespread corruption in contracting out the services, and largely, the services provided by the outsourced service providers are unsatisfactory to public health service entities. The paper said that it was a common practice in the health service sector that pharmaceutical companies through their representatives maintain a good relationship with the practicing doctors so that doctors prescribe their medicines. The paper said that the doctors and diagnostic centres are allegedly believed to be connected. The diagnostic centres use to offer doctors a percentage of the test cost which is borne by the patients. It is a common complaint by the patients in Bangladesh that the doctors suggest for unnecessary diagnostic tests. According to the White Paper, the country lost $16 billion annually on an average between 2009 and 2023 because of the illicit fund flow amid systemic tax evasion, misuse of exemptions, and poorly managed public finances under the authoritarian Awami League regime. The white Paper revealed that the significant fiscal opportunities lost to corruption, stated that halving tax exemptions could double education funding and triple health allocations.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/miscellany/252122/white-paper-finds-systematic-corruption-in-health-sector
"Flower trader killed being hit by bus, 2 arrested","The police arrested the driver and the assistant of a Shyamoli Paribahan bus that killed a flower trader by hitting him at Shahbagh in the capital on Thursday. The deceased is Mohammad Anwar Hossain, 55, a flower trader at the Shahbagh flower market. Confirming the matter, Shahbagh police station officer-in-charge Mohammad Khalid Mansoor said that the accident took place in the morning when Anwar was crossing the road. ‘A case was filed in this regard. Police seized the bus and arrested its driver and his assistant,’ he added. Anwar, a resident of Sirajdikhan upazila in Munshiganj, was living in a rented house with his family in Dhaka’s Hazaribagh area.

"Accusations, walkouts as Ukraine, Russia ministers clash at Malta","Ukraine’s foreign minister called Russia’s top diplomat Sergei Lavrov a ‘war criminal’ Thursday as they both attended an international meeting in Malta, the latter’s first visit to an EU country since the 2022 invasion. Ukraine’s Andriy Sybiga also accused Moscow of being ‘the biggest threat to our common security’ as both ministers sat at the same huge table for a meeting of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The ministers from Poland and Latvia and half a dozen other delegates walked out when Lavrov addressed the meeting in Ta’Qali, near Malta, according to a diplomatic source. Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski said earlier Thursday he refused to ‘listen to those lies’, and then repeated a call for Russia to be suspended from the OSCE. The 57-nation body was formed in the midst of the Cold War, but has been largely paralysed since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, with Russia vetoing major decisions that require unanimous consent. Lavrov, sitting between the representatives of San Marino and Romania, accused NATO and the EU of politicising the OSCE and making it irrelevant. He said the West was behind a ‘reincarnation of the Cold War, only now with a much greater risk of a transition to a hot one’, according to Russia’s RIA Novosti agency. Speaking to reporters afterwards, Lavrov also accused the West of failing to heed Moscow’s ‘very clear warnings’ over the dangers of dispatching troops to support Ukraine, amid speculation over possible deployments. When it was his turn to speak, US secretary of state Antony Blinken blasted Russian President Vladimir Putin for an ‘imperial project to erase Ukraine from the map’. He also accused Lavrov — who by that point had left the room — of ‘drowning listeners with a tsunami of misinformation’. Blinken left Malta without meeting his Russian counterpart. Ukraine has also previously called for Russia to be excluded from the OSCE, and last year boycotted the organisation’s annual ministerial summit in North Macedonia over Lavrov’s attendance. But Sybiga attended this year, at a delicate time for Kyiv. US president-elect Donald Trump has vowed to press for a quick deal to end the war, leaving Kyiv scrambling to obtain security guarantees from Western allies and supplies of key weaponry before the January inauguration. Sybiga told the OSCE ministers that Russia’s participation in the organisation was ‘a threat to cooperation in Europe’ and ‘the biggest threat to our common security’. ‘Ukraine continues to fight for its right to exist. And the Russian war criminal at this table must know: Ukraine will win this right and justice will prevail,’ he said. The OSCE, founded in 1975, is made up of members from Turkey to Mongolia, and also includes Britain, Canada and the United States. It helps its members coordinate issues such as human rights and arms control, but it has been increasingly unable to operate, its budget frozen since 2021 and the post of secretary general vacant since September. German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters that the OSCE ‘stands for security and freedom and we will defend it’. In 2022, OSCE host Poland refused to let Lavrov attend their summit, and Poland’s minister questioned why Moscow was still allowed to be part of the organisation. A spokesman for Malta’s chairmanship of the OSCE told AFP Wednesday that while Lavrov faced an EU asset freeze, there was no travel ban on him. He had been invited to ‘keep some channels of communication open’. The summit runs until Friday, and host Ian Borg, Malta’s foreign minister, said he was ‘cautiously optimistic’ they would agree on a new secretary general. Ambassadors have already agreed on Turkish diplomat Feridun Sinirlioglu to replace Germany’s Helga Maria Schmid, a diplomatic source said, but this must be confirmed by the ministers. Organisers also hope to decide which country will chair the OSCE in 2026 and 2027. Russia blocked NATO member Estonia from holding the chairmanship this year. Finland, which joined NATO last year, is up for the post in 2025. The OSCE sends observers to conflicts and to elections around the world. It also runs programmes aimed at combatting human trafficking and ensuring press freedom.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252119/accusations-walkouts-as-ukraine-russia-ministers-clash-at-malta
30 Red Cross staff killed in 2024,"Dozens of Red Cross staff and volunteers gathered Wednesday for a candlelight vigil for more than 30 of their colleagues killed in 2024, during the deadliest year on record for humanitarians. More than 100 people crowded outside the headquarters of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Geneva, most donning red vests and carrying candles. The tribute came as a Palestine Red Crescent volunteer was killed Wednesday in the Gaza Strip, which ‘brings the total number of IFRC network members killed worldwide this year to 32’, the group said in a statement. ‘Alaa Al-Derawi, a member of PRCS’s emergency medical team, was fatally shot in the Khan Younis area of Gaza, shortly after transporting patients for treatment. He was returning to base when the incident occurred,’ it said. In Geneva, standing in the stinging cold in front of a banner emblazoned with the words ‘Protect Humanity’, some held up pictures of the staff and volunteers killed this year while performing their humanitarian duties. ‘We are shocked. We are appalled,’ Nena Stoiljkovic, the IFRC’s under secretary-general for Global Relations, Humanitarian Diplomacy and Digitalisation, told the gathering. ‘We are not a target,’ added IFRC official Frank Mohrhauer. Following a minute of silence, an IFRC staff member solemnly read out the names of those killed. They were among a record number of aid workers who have perished around the world this year. Already last month, the United Nations said the record number of 280 humanitarians killed in 2023 had been surpassed, and the number has kept climbing. Israel’s devastating war in Gaza has especially been driving up the numbers, but aid workers were also subject to violence and killings in a range of countries including Sudan and Ukraine. ‘2024 is now the deadliest year on record for humanitarian workers, especially for local staff and volunteers worldwide,’ Stoiljkovic said. ‘This grim milestone has not spared the IFRC network,’ she said, pointing to more ‘heartbreaking news’ just last week when another Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteer was killed, and eight others injured in an attack. ‘They were rescuing people in desperate need of humanitarian assistance,’ she said. Stoiljkovic said that the event, which came before International Volunteers’ Day on Thursday, provided ‘a moment to reflect’ on the towering losses with ‘sadness and compassion’.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252118/30-red-cross-staff-killed-in-2024
Qatar resumes Gaza mediation,"Qatar has resumed its role as a mediator in efforts to secure a truce in the Israel-Hamas war following a brief suspension, a source with knowledge of the talks said on Thursday. The Gulf emirate, along with the United States and Egypt, had been involved in months of unsuccessful negotiations for a Gaza truce and hostage release after nearly 14 months of war. In November, Doha announced it had put its mediation on hold, saying it would resume when Hamas and Israel showed ‘willingness and seriousness’. The source, speaking to AFP on Thursday on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of talks, said that Qatar has now ‘returned to mediation’, without elaborating on any recent meetings between officials. The war has raged since Palestinian militant group Hamas staged the deadliest ever attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. The attack on southern Israel resulted in 1,208 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel’s retaliatory campaign has killed 44,580 people in the Gaza Strip, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable. During the October 7 attack, Palestinian militants also seized 251 hostages, 96 of whom remain in Gaza including 34 the Israeli military says are dead. Scores of hostages were released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails during a one-week pause in fighting brokered by Qatar last year. Since then, successive rounds of negotiations have made no headway. US president-elect Donald Trump on Monday warned on social media of unspecified massive repercussions if hostages are not released by the time he takes office next month. Trump has vowed staunch support for Israel and promised to reign back on occasional criticism voiced by outgoing president Joe Biden’s administration. The president-elect has also indicated desire to secure deals on the world stage. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Trump on Tuesday for his ‘strong statement’ on social media.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252117/qatar-resumes-gaza-mediation
HRW slams Saudi labour abuses ahead of 2034 World Cup vote,"Human Rights Watch criticised the treatment of migrant workers on construction projects in Saudi Arabia Wednesday ahead of the expected confirmation of the kingdom’s hosting of the 2034 World Cup. Human Rights Watch said it had obtained government figures showing 884 Bangladeshis died in Saudi Arabia between January and July 2024, with 80 per cent of the deaths attributed to ‘natural causes’. Despite labour law reforms introduced in 2021, workers said they continue to depend on their employers to change jobs or leave the country, a system that the rights group describes as exploitative. The New York-based rights group reported working conditions it said amounted to ‘forced labour’, even on high-profile megaprojects at the heart of Saudi’s ambitious Vision 2030 economic reform programme. HRW said the malpractice included ‘exorbitant recruitment fees, rampant wage theft, inadequate protections from extreme heat, restrictions on transferring jobs and uninvestigated worker deaths’. The abuses affected migrant workers at every stage of their association with the oil-rich Gulf monarchy, from recruitment to their return home, Human Rights Watch said. Risks are worsened by pressure to meet ‘unrealistic, tight deadlines for projects’, HRW said, citing interviews with 155 former and current migrant workers and families of deceased workers across employment sectors and regions. ‘Every day, one or two workers faint, including during mornings and evenings, sometimes on the way to work, sometimes while working,’ said one worker on NEOM, a futuristic mega-city that is the kingdom’s most ambitious project. Like other Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia is home to millions of Indian, Pakistani and Filipino workers in low-paid, menial jobs that are largely avoided by citizens. The widow of one deceased Indian plumber told the rights group her husband ‘did not have any health issues’ and his family ‘do not believe that he died of natural death’ although it was recorded on his health certificate. Human Rights Watch said football’s governing body FIFA had ‘engineered the World Cup hosting process to ignore the blatant human rights risks, including forced labour’. ‘The human engine powering the construction of Saudi Arabia’s multibillion dollar giga-projects is the migrant workforce, who are facing widespread rights violations in Saudi Arabia without any recourse,’ said HRW’s deputy Middle East director, Michael Page. In its evaluation of the kingdom’s bid, published on Saturday, FIFA described the Saudi bid as ‘a very strong all-round proposition’, but cautioned that Saudi Arabia’s human rights commitments could require ‘significant effort and time’ before the 2034 World Cup.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252116/hrw-slams-saudi-labour-abuses-ahead-of-2034-world-cup-vote
A city still asleep on women’s safety,"FOR most women, going out of the house requires a lot of planning. From crowded streets and public transport to workplaces, the challenges that women face in staying safe are constant and exhausting. Citizens now call for women’s safety on the road and in public spaces. Everyone wants change. Women want to walk without the fear of being harassed or attacked. There might be debates on the ways to measure how safe and liveable a city is, but there are certainly some indicators that are pretty reliable to measure whether a city is safe and liveable for its residents. For example, if a woman can walk alone and safely at night along a city road, it indicates that the city is safe in some respects — there is personal security for residents. In cities like Dhaka, beneath the surface, women grapple with a complex web of daily challenges. Dhaka streets have become arenas of apprehension where women must navigate everything from unsettling glances to outright physical assaults. A study by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and the United Nations Population Fund has found that 43 per cent of women in Dhaka have faced sexual harassment in public places. This is not just a number. This is women living in fear every day. Poorly-lit roads, crowded public transports and a lack of safe spaces make women feel vulnerable. The very layout of our cities seems to disregard women’s needs, hindering their ability to move freely. A research by BRAC pinpoints two significant issues: a need for well-lit streets and facilities specifically designed for women. These are not mere logistical oversights; they stem from deep-seated cultural beliefs that foster a hostile environment for women. A report by ActionAid underscores this. The report has found that 60 per cent of women feel limited by cultural expectations that restrict their freedom and increase their safety concern. It is a sobering reality that calls for earnest reflection and tangible change. Women do not only feel unsafe on the roads and in the streets. Many apparel workers face additional challenges. The issue is not only about the harassment, but also the silence that surrounds it. Despite such challenges, there is hope and it starts with the community. Many are now pushing for a change. Some people argue that stringent law enforcement could be an answer. Others think self-defence training could help. Men, too, are stepping up to create spaces safe for women. The city authorities can play a role in creating safe spaces for women with designated areas in public transports and improved lighting in public spaces. Technology could also help. Mobile apps offering emergency support and increased surveillance in public spaces could improve safety, as they did in other cities. With proper planning and the right tools, technology can play a key role in making Dhaka safe. Safety is more than protection — it is a rallying cry for freedom. It is a manifesto that challenges established norms and aligns with a broader vision of inclusivity and empowerment. Creating a city safe for women goes beyond individual actions. It requires a community that is willing to listen, take action and work together. Policymakers, citizens and local organisations must unite to build an environment where women feel respected and protected. By prioritising education, enforcing laws and improving public infrastructure, Dhaka can transform into a city where women can live without fear. In this era of swift technological progress, the digital domain offers fresh avenues for enhancing women’s safety in urban landscapes. The fusion of technology, urban planning and social consciousness takes form in data-driven planning, utilising analytics to create women-friendly infrastructure. By integrating technology, we can create a future where women’s safety is a priority, not an afterthought. A platform, Amio Jitte Chai, funded by USAID and launched by Democracy International, now offers a space on www.amiojittechai.com to discuss the struggles and suggest solutions.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/opinion/252090/a-city-still-asleep-on-womens-safety
Putting migrants back into rural entrepreneurship,"I HAVE had the privilege of working with various academic institutions in countries like Malaysia, Oman, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. All these countries are temporary homes of a large foreign workforce, many of whom hail from Bangladesh. Driven by my deep habitual curiosity to empathise with their challenging lives, I frequently engage in conversation with these workforces, particularly those who are from my own homeland. While having a conversation, I understand their intense eagerness to get back to their roots, be with family and acquaintances, and contribute to the local development. Some of them returned back to the country, drawn by the pull of roots, but many of them, unfortunately, had to leave behind the loving family and step into the harsh reality again. Mr Shafiq, a Bangladeshi migrant, while serving in a restaurant, told me, ‘Wish the country was favourable for people like us to start our own business.’ Similarly said by Mr Zahed who works as a janitor in a shopping mall and earns an average income. Both of them remit roughly eighty per cent of their income to support their families while themselves living meagerly, making substantial personal sacrifices. Meanwhile, there are Bangladeshis who started their own businesses overseas even with a lump sum amount. Notably, the white-collar Bangladeshi migrants are also at large in Australia, European countries, Gulf countries, Southeast Asian countries, the UK, and the USA. However, a large number of semi-skilled workers from Bangladesh are engaged in blue-collar jobs as well, particularly in the Gulf countries, Singapore, and Malaysia. Surprisingly, there is a discrepancy with the number of the migrants’ who are currently working abroad from Bangladesh. The ministries and Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics have different numbers varying from 5 million to 15 million. It’s simply bizarre that even after 50 years of independence, the country has not developed a system that could accurately record the outflow and inflow of the Bangladeshi migrants, despite their significant contribution to the foreign currency reserve system. Undoubtedly, remitting foreign currency is way better for the country’s economic development. Recently (July-October 2024), it was evident that remittance by foreign workers plays an immense role in supporting the economic ailment and economic progress of the country. Concurrently, we should also consider how we can make use of the knowledge and expertise of the returnee workforce, or returnee migrants, and contribute to local development. According to the International Organisation for Migration, returnee migrants are defined as the migrants who go back to one’s own culture, family, and home from abroad. In many countries, returnee migrants play a pivotal role in socio-economic development. Realising the fact, Narendra Modi of India, Paul Kagame of Rwanda, and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Türkiye have called on and encouraged their educated professionals’ diasporas abroad to come back and join in rebuilding their nations. Unlike these countries, many keep track of the returnee migrants, which could be the simplest indicator of a structured intent to reintegrate the returnee migrants into the local economy. Unfortunately, in Bangladesh, there is no valid track record of the migrants, let alone the returnee migrants. International Organisation for Migration in Bangladesh conceded that there is no recorded number of Bangladeshi returnee migrants. In fact, there is an absence of knowledge transfer and absorption mechanisms in the country. Till the date, there is potential scope to reveal the challenges the returnee migrants face to reintegrate them into the local community and economy. On returning to the homeland, the returnee migrants face difficulties in finding employment and also start a business despite having skills and expertise. Based on the observations, it is relatively apparent that there is a lack of clear framework, mechanism, infrastructure, and policy to effectively use the skills and expertise of the returnee migrants. It is important to create a database of out-bound and in-bound migrants and provide them with a migrant ID card, which will enable them to keep track of the records of the migrants. The database will include all required information that could be used for their reintegration. The returnee migrants can be granted financial loans for start-up businesses, particularly in the semi-urban or rural areas. Upon returning to the country, many attempted to lay the foundation of their future in the urban cities. While some of them could utilise their skills and capabilities acquired overseas in the urban industries, others, for their survival, return to their villages in rural or semi-urban areas. But the most significant and pressing challenge they face while they return to their roots. Neither is there anyone to hire them, nor do they have appropriate infrastructure and facilities to start their own business. This is where an effective rural entrepreneurship framework could play a transformative role. Rural entrepreneurship refers to a process and strategy aimed at empowering the rural areas by fostering business activities to minimise the urban-rural gap. Scholars contend that rural entrepreneurship is the route towards social, economic, and environmental advancement in the rural areas of a country. It could possibly curb the trend of migration, particularly to the capital city. The most important thing that could be done is to set up a dedicated rural entrepreneurship centre in suburban areas envisioned as the hub for rural entrepreneurial activities. The centres could either be run through public-private partnerships or fully managed by the local government entities. Due to rapid technological development, the internet is the game changer. Utilising the latest technology, web-based or mobile phone-based applications could be developed that will work as one-stop solutions for returnee-migrant entrepreneurs, traders, suppliers, distributors, and other relevant stakeholders. As we know, connectivity is productivity. Hence, the tech-based one-stop solution could be most conducive to expediting the economic activities in the rural areas. In addition, there should be an integrated system that will allow returnee-migrant rural entrepreneurs to obtain any civic facilities required, be it trade licenses, renting godowns/shops/houses, and, most importantly, accessing digital finance services. E-commerce could also play a vital role in engaging the returnee migrants to flourish rural entrepreneurship. Customised training programmes by the returnee migrants to the other rural entrepreneurs through the one-stop solution would surely add substantial value. Even promoting rural tourism by returnee-migrant rural entrepreneurs could highly benefit the development of the locality. By equipping rural areas with easy access to a digital financing system, a one-stop solution system, infrastructure development, and skills and expertise of the returnee migrants, we can certainly grow rural entrepreneurship. Thus, rural entrepreneurship may play an instrumental role in dealing with the opportunities and challenges of returnee migrants.

Labour violation in online services,"DIGITAL platform services in Bangladesh, such as Pathao, Uber and Foodpanda, have revolutionised the transportation and food delivery sectors. These companies have provided new employment opportunities and convenience to urban dwellers. However, their operational models have come under scrutiny for systemic labour violations, which exploit workers under the guise of technological innovation and flexible employment. Adopting a neo-Marxist perspective reveals how these platforms perpetuate class-based exploitation, undermine workers’ rights, and reinforce capitalist hegemony.  Rise of platform capitalism in Bangladesh PLATFORM capitalism, characterised by businesses operating as intermediaries to connect service providers and consumers via digital technology, has rapidly expanded in Bangladesh. Companies like Pathao, Uber, and Foodpanda present themselves as enablers of entrepreneurship. They claim to empower workers by offering flexible schedules and access to earnings. However, these claims mask the precarious working conditions and lack of basic labour protections that define their business models. These platforms do not simply enable labour; they commodify it. Workers on these platforms are not traditional employees but independent contractors, a designation that absolves companies of providing benefits such as health insurance, paid leave, and job security. This arrangement allows platform companies to maximise surplus value by shifting operational risks and costs onto workers while retaining control over labour processes through algorithms and performance metrics.  Case studies of labour violations Pathao: Exploitation Behind the Local Icon Pathao, often celebrated as a local success story in the ride-sharing and delivery sectors, is a prime example of exploitative practices. Riders frequently complain about declining earnings due to unilateral changes in payment structures. For instance, base fares have been reduced over time, leaving riders to bear the rising costs of fuel and vehicle maintenance. Additionally, Pathao’s incentive schemes, marketed as ways to boost earnings, are contingent on completing an unreasonable number of rides within strict time frames, leading to overwork and stress. Workers also lack access to grievance redressal mechanisms. Complaints about unfair treatment, arbitrary account suspensions, or deductions are often ignored. This creates a sense of alienation among workers, a hallmark of capitalist labour relations, as described by Marx ages ago. Pathao’s exploitation is further exacerbated by the lack of government regulation, which enables the company to operate with impunity. Uber: global giant, local exploiter Uber’s operations in Bangladesh mirror its exploitative practices globally. Drivers are subject to high commission rates, sometimes exceeding 25 per cent of their earnings, leaving them with minimal take-home pay. While benefiting the company, the platform’s dynamic pricing algorithms create uncertainty for drivers, who often struggle to predict their earnings. Moreover, Uber drivers in Bangladesh frequently report harassment and safety concerns, with little support from the company. The absence of insurance or compensation for accidents further highlights the precariousness of their employment. It needs to be mentioned that clients and riders of Uber have faced issues with driver behaviour, and these issues have not been addressed on many occasions due to a lack of internal governance and accountability. Foodpanda: the gig worker’s plight Foodpanda, a dominant player in the food delivery sector, has faced backlash from delivery workers over low pay and exploitative working conditions. Riders are often required to work extended hours to meet unrealistic delivery quotas, earning wages that barely cover their daily expenses. During the Covid pandemic, when demand for delivery services surged, Foodpanda did little to protect its workers, many of whom were forced to work without adequate personal protective equipment or health benefits. The company’s algorithmic management system, which tracks workers in real-time, imposes a form of digital surveillance. Workers are penalised for delays or cancelled orders, often without consideration of external factors such as traffic or weather. This constant monitoring and lack of autonomy reflect what neo-Marxists describe as the ‘digital Taylorism’ of platform capitalism — a modern manifestation of the exploitation inherent in capitalist production. In the current context, digital platforms in Bangladesh exemplify the commodification of labour, the alienation of workers, and the consolidation of capitalist power.  Commodification of labour DIGITAL platforms reduce labour to a commodity that can be bought and sold on demand. Workers are treated as interchangeable units, valued only for their ability to generate profit. This commodification strips workers of their individuality and dignity, reducing them to mere cogs in the capitalist machine. Pathao’s riders, Uber’s drivers, and Foodpanda’s delivery personnel are all subjected to this dehumanising process.  Alienation and precarity MARX described alienation as the estrangement of workers from the products of their labour, the labour process, their fellow workers, and their own humanity. In the context of digital platforms, workers experience alienation in multiple forms. They have little control over their work conditions, face isolation due to the individualised nature of gig work, and are disconnected from the fruits of their labour, as profits are syphoned off by platform owners. Precarity is another defining feature of platform work. The lack of stable employment contracts leaves workers vulnerable to income volatility and economic insecurity. Neo-Marxists argue that such precarity is not an accidental byproduct but a deliberate strategy to weaken labour’s bargaining power and maintain capitalist dominance.  Concentration of capitalist power DESPITE their rhetoric of decentralisation and empowerment, digital platforms concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few. The founders and investors of Pathao, Uber, and Foodpanda reap substantial profits while workers struggle to make ends meet. This growing inequality mirrors the structural dynamics of global capitalism, where technological advancements primarily benefit the capitalist class at the expense of labour.  Towards a just future ADDRESSING labour violations in Bangladesh’s digital platform sector requires systemic changes. Government intervention is crucial to regulate these platforms, ensuring fair wages, benefits, and worker protections. For instance, mandating minimum wage standards and insurance coverage could mitigate some of the risks faced by platform workers. Additionally, the formation of worker cooperatives or unions could help resist the exploitative practices of platform companies. Public awareness campaigns are also essential to highlight the exploitative nature of gig work and mobilise support for policy reforms. Academics and activists must continue to critique platform capitalism from a Neo-Marxist perspective, exposing its inherent contradictions and advocating for alternative models of economic organisation.  Conclusion THE rise of digital platform services in Bangladesh has brought both opportunities and challenges. While companies like Pathao, Uber, and Foodpanda have reshaped the economy, they have done so at the expense of workers, perpetuating exploitation and inequality. From a Neo-Marxist perspective, these platforms exemplify the exploitative dynamics of contemporary capitalism, where labour is commodified, alienation is intensified, and capitalist power is consolidated. To create a more equitable digital economy, it is imperative to challenge the structural injustices of platform capitalism. This requires collective action, robust regulation, and a commitment to reimagining economic systems that prioritise human dignity over profit.

Sustainability education and practice at schools,"BANGLADESH is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change in the world, despite its minimal contribution to the global greenhouse gas emissions. Bangladesh historically has faced several climate disasters, where the 1988 flood and the 2007 cyclone Sidr are some notable events. According to the latest ‘Global Climate Risk Index 2021’ by Germanwatch, Bangladesh ranks as the seventh most affected country globally by extreme weather events from 2000 to 2019. According to a more recent report, ‘The World Risk Report 2024 – Focus: Multiple Crises’ by the Institute for International Law of Peace and Armed Conflict of the Ruhr-University Bochum and an alliance of nine German development organisations, Bangladesh is classified with ‘very high risk’ with a score of 27.73; whereas any score above 12.89 is indicated as ‘risky’. If looked at closely, every year such calamities are reoccurring, and newer heights of extreme weather can be noticed. The 174 million population of the country are facing the consequences of such disasters at regular intervals every year, although these consequences may not be visible with the naked eye, but it can be said the climate crisis drives several different and interconnected factors. Looking into one scenario, the floods every year are one of the factors responsible for the river erosion that we see in the news. According to the statistics provided by the UN from 1973-2017, the three main rivers, Padma, Meghna, and Jamuna, have engulfed 160,000 hectares of land. By the end of 2020, another 4,500 hectares were lost, according to the Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services, displacing around 45,000 people. This loss of land results in riverbank populations losing their land for living and farming, forcing them to migrate to cities looking for work and a roof over their head. Due to which you can see the significant rise in the density of the population in the urban areas of Bangladesh, causing several other problems to be tackled. The rising average temperature is another scenario to investigate; in recent years (2018-2022), Bangladesh has experienced a hike of 0.9°C in its summer temperature. Bangladesh recorded its highest temperature of 43.8°C in 2024, which was the highest in 50 years. Such extreme heat disrupts the daily life of working group people and also significantly affects farming of crops and essentials, disrupting the necessary supply. In this scenario, education must play a central role in tackling the crisis. It is wise to say at this point, ‘having a sustainable mindset is a necessity for the people in Bangladesh.’ What is sustainability? is one question, the answer to which is not clear to even the literate population of the country. Sustainability, in simple words, is meeting our needs today in a manner that the future generations can meet their needs, which includes using natural resources responsibly, establishing a balance and harmony with nature, and adapting more sustainable methods in our daily lives. A more straightforward statement can be living our lives by not damaging the environment too much so that the future generation can survive. In 2015 the United Nations introduced the 17 sustainable development goals for its member states to achieve sustainable development by 2030. Among these, goal number 13, ‘Climate Action,’ is one of the least emphasised goals in Bangladesh by the local authorities and international voluntary organisations. The best chance for Bangladesh in having a ‘sustainable mindset’ is to train its children from a young age and allow them to grow and develop from the learning. Investing in sustainability education for its youth offers Bangladesh a unique opportunity to create a generation capable of mitigating and adapting to climate change. The first step towards this approach should begin at schools where students can be made aware of the crisis, the current scenario, various sustainable practices, etc. No doubt, it can be said that ‘sustainability’ has just been a textbook topic in the education system in Bangladesh, with no minimal or proper knowledge of it amongst the previous and upcoming generations. Topics like climate science, renewable energy, and waste management are integrated into subjects such as science, geography, and social studies, which can provide students with a well-rounded understanding of sustainability. Hands-on activities, such as tree planting, recycling programs, and energy-saving initiatives, can instill eco-friendly habits in children. A study by UNESCO revealed that early exposure to sustainability practices leads to lifelong environmental stewardship. Today’s students are tomorrow’s policymakers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. Educating them about sustainable development ensures that they grow into leaders capable of making informed decisions to combat climate change in their respective fields. The five initial steps urgently required in both the public and private education systems are as follows: Ensure proper training of teachers on sustainability and its practice. Integration of basic knowledge regarding the environment and how to take care of it in the curriculum. Engage students with sustainable activities in their daily lives. Encourage the schools to adopt a ‘green efficiency and practice’ mindset and benefit from it in the short and long term. Bangladesh’s vulnerability to climate change makes it imperative to educate its young population about sustainability. To address these issues, the government must allocate more resources to education and collaborate with NGOs and international organisations. However, progress is being made with non-governmental organisations that have launched programs to raise climate awareness in schools, but much remains to be done to mainstream sustainability education nationwide, and the process is too slow and needs a boost. Sustainability education is not just an option for Bangladesh; it is a necessity. The time to act is now.

"DAP should prioritise sustainability, liveability","THE initiative to revise Dhaka’s detailed area plan, revised only a year ago amid criticism by urban planners and green activists, has once again given birth to concern. Urban planners at a discussion that the Institute for Planning and Development organised on December 4 expressed concern at the recent revised proposals for the detailed area plan that Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha published, noting that the proposals ignore the city’s liveability, civic amenities and the environment and, rather, prioritise commercial interests of housing traders. The proposals have focused solely on increasing the size and height of buildings, neglecting crucial environmental issues, including protecting floodplains, wetland and agricultural land. The proposals to increase the floor area ratio for building construction will, as urban planners say, further jeopardise Dhaka’s liveability as they fail to adhere to urban planning principles. The floor area ratio is already very high and a reason green and open space is shrinking in Dhaka, already ranked one of the worst liveable cities in both the Global Liveability Index and the Safe Cities Index for years. A failure to implement DAP 2010, followed by lax enforcement of DAP 2022–2035, is believed to have led Dhaka to its current chaotic state. Urban development plans here are, in fact, ecologically insensitive and take little consideration of public welfare and liveability. The authorities came up with a number of promising plans, rules and regulations to save Dhaka, but most of them could not be implemented because of incoordination among agencies and associated corruption. Government agencies have carried out development work without any regard for the plan and other rules and regulations while illegal construction and encroachment on public spaces have continued unabated. Dhaka has, therefore, witnessed a messy growth where city dwellers are deprived of healthy living facilities. All the rivers and canals in and around Dhaka are either dead or faced with a slow death while large parts of the flood-flow zones have been encroached on. More than 22,500 acres of wetland, including water bodies, flood-flow zones, low-lying areas and canals, in and around the capital have been filled up since detailed area plan came into effect in 2010, as a recent report of the Bangladesh Institute of Planners says. The report shows that 20.58 per cent of the city land area was wetland and 35.71 per cent green and vacant land in 1995. About 43 per cent land was that time developed, which has now increased to 76.78 per cent and more city land is coming under concrete coverage. The city authorities have also failed to improve the drainage while development projects have destroyed several drainage systems. Urban planners have, rather, emphasised the need to revise the area plan using sustainable strategies and approaches that prioritise public interest, liveability and environmental preservation. The authorities should, therefore, prioritise public welfare and liveability, not commercial interests of any quarters.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/252083/dap-should-prioritise-sustainability-liveability
Police should put in more efforts to arrest jailbreakers,"ABOUT 700 prisoners who escaped jails during the time of turmoil around the fall of the Awami League government, toppled on August 5 in a mass uprising that resulted from student protests spanning July, still being at large is worrying. The prisons directorate at a press conference in Dhaka on December 4, highlighting the directorate’s activities of the past three months, said that more than 2,200 people escaped from five jails; and 1,500 of them have so far either surrendered or have been arrested by the law enforcement agencies. In the Narsingdi jailbreak that took place on July 19, 826 prisoners and others detained escaped; 596 prisoners escaped the Satkhira jail and 518 prisoners escaped the Sherpur jail on August 5; 201 prisoners escaped the Kashimpur jail on August 6 and close to a hundred prisoners escaped the Kushita jail on August 7. What is further worrying, as the inspector general of prisons has said, is that some of the people who escaped are death-row convicts and many, especially in the Narsingdi jailbreak, have escaped with looted firearms. This makes the situation alarming. The inspector general seeks to say the jailer concerned has been suspended after the incident and necessary action has been taken against all others responsible. But this does not lessen the gravity of the situation at all. The jailbreaks appear to have happened at a time when law and order was not in shape amidst the political turmoil and mostly after August 5, when law enforcement was very weak. The army, which promised to attend to issues of law and order and security, appears to have left the prisons inadequately attended. The prisons authorities also appear to have taken no proper precautions to protect the prisons, especially at a time when law enforcement was clearly declining or declined. The jailbreaks in Kashimpur, Satkhira, Kushtia and Sherpur are reported to have happened after demonstrations by some prisoners and in some cases attacks by the cohorts and relatives of the prisoners from outside the jails. In the Kashimpur jailbreak that happened on August 7, at least six prisoners are reported to have been killed when prison guards shot at them. A similar incident also happened in the Sirajganj jail on August 7, but the prison guards, aided by the army, could foil the jailbreak attempt. All this having happened, the inspector general of prisons at the press conference at hand has said that 17 out of the 69 jails were in a rickety condition. A situation like this warrants that the authorities should immediately attend to the physical condition of the prisons so that such jailbreaks do not recur. There should be no lapses in the security of prisons to stop such events from recurring. Whilst the authorities should take early steps to prevent the recurrence of any jailbreak, they should also put in more efforts to find out and arrest the people who broke the prions and are still at large because they continue to pose security risks.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/252082/police-should-put-in-more-efforts-to-arrest-jailbreakers
