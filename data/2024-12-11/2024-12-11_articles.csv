Low demand exposes many vulnerabilities,"More than three quarters of Bangladesh’s installed power generation capacity remained unused for a few hours in the morning since the winter officially began on the first day of December. The power demand is likely to drop further in the coming days with the winter intensifying, potentially worsening power overcapacity, which cost over Tk 1 lakh crore in the 15 years until 2023. Electricity demand dropping low during winter is nothing new and rather a reminder of Bangladesh passing yet another year without expected economic growth. Bangladesh’s current installed power generation capacity is 27,740MW. The minimum power demand at 5:00am on Wednesday was 6,771MW. The maximum supply of 16,477MW of electricity was recorded on April 30. The ousted Awami League government invested $33 billion in the power sector alone, increasing the power generation capacity by more than five-fold to accelerate economic activities that remained elusive for over a decade. ‘Economic activities are rather declining,’ said energy expert Ijaz Hossain. ‘We are heading towards an unreal situation. We must increase our energy consumption,’ said Ijaz. Despite the massive power overcapacity, industries fail to operate at their full capacity for over two years due to energy shortage. Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry recently held a discussion where the keynote paper showed a 30 per cent fall in industrial production due to energy shortage. Measuring the actual status of economic activities by the electricity consumed through the national grid is, however, difficult because industries rely more on captive power than the grid. Besides the poor status of the national grid, another reason for low industrial power consumption is the AL government’s policy to incentivise captive power production. A unit of electricity is produced at a captive power plant by using gas at a subsidised cost of Tk 4.5, whereas a unit of electricity from the national grid costs about Tk 8. Bangladesh’s current captive power capacity is 2,800MW. ‘Industries’ power consumption remained literally unchanged over the past five years,’ said energy expert Mohammad Tamim. In 2023, the Power Development Board data showed that 27.63 per cent of the overall electricity produced—79,270 units—was sold to the industrial sector, down from 37.1 per cent sold in 2019 out of 21,955 units produced. The PDB’s sale of electricity to industries has steadily  declined over the past three decades since 1994, the year since when the sale data is available. In 1994, the industrial sector used 45.72 per cent of the total 6,148.8 units produced by the PDB. All industries where production is seriously hampered due to frequent power cuts have their own source of electricity, which is known as captive power, energy experts said. The supply of gas to captive power is also responsible for deteriorating the fuel crisis in the power plants generating power for the national grid. Over half of Bangladesh’s gas-based power generation capacity remains unused during peak summer because of fuel shortage. The idle gas plants generate a huge capacity charge. The US-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis report estimated that shifting half the industrial captive power demand to the national grid would save Tk 34.14 billion annually. Household is the main consumer of electricity. Bangladesh officially achieved 100 per cent electrification in 2022. Energy experts also doubt that the grid was ready to satisfy household demand as power cuts have been frequent even in winter. An analysis of officially-released data revealed that power demand increased by about 5 per cent in the second week of December, compared with the same time in the past winter. The electricity demand by households during summer increases by about 5,000MW. ‘The power demand growth this winter should have been greater, perhaps 7 per cent or more,’ said IEEFA lead analyst Shafiqul Alam. An analysis of official data showed that power generation usage capacity was 24 per cent in the past year, down from 28 per cent in the previous year. In 2022, the power capacity usage was 28 per cent, followed by 27 per cent in 2021 and 2020. The student-led mass uprising that overthrew Sheikh Hasina government on August 5 lead to a period of unrest disrupting economic activities, energy experts said. They feared impending significant job losses if economic activities did not scale up.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/power-energy/252598/low-demand-exposes-many-vulnerabilities
New Syria PM says all religious groups’ rights ‘guaranteed’,"Syria’s new prime minister said the Islamist-led alliance that ousted president Bashar al-Assad will ‘guarantee’ the rights of all religious groups and called on the millions who fled the war to return home. Assad fled Syria after a lightning offensive spearheaded by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group and its allies, which brought to a spectacular end five decades of brutal rule by his clan. Syrians across the country and around the world erupted in celebration, after enduring a stifling five decades that saw anyone suspected of dissent thrown into jail or killed. With Assad’s overthrow plunging Syria into the unknown, its new rulers have sought to assure members of the country’s religious minorities that they will not repress them. Sunni Muslim HTS is rooted in Syria’s branch of al-Qaeda and is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many Western governments, though it has sought to moderate its rhetoric. ‘Precisely because we are Islamic, we will guarantee the rights of all people and all sects in Syria,’ said Mohammad al-Bashir, whom the rebels appointed as the transitional head of government. Asked whether Syria’s new constitution would be Islamic, he told Italian daily Corriere della Sera that ‘we will clarify all these details during the constituent process’. Bashir, whose appointment was announced Tuesday, is tasked with heading the multi-ethnic, multi-sectarian country until March 1. After decades of iron-fisted rule by the Assads — adherents of the minority Alawite offshoot of Shiite Islam — Syrians now face the enormous challenge of charting a new course as they emerge from nearly 14 years of war. Roaming the opulent Damascus home of Assad, Abu Omar felt a sense of giddy defiance being in the residence of the man he said had long oppressed him. ‘I am taking pictures, because I am so happy to be here in the middle of his house,’ said the 44-year-old. ‘I came for revenge. They oppressed us in incredible ways,’ he added. The war has killed more than 5,00,000 people and forced half the population to flee their homes, with six million of them seeking refuge abroad. In his interview with Corriere della Sera, which was published on Wednesday, Bashir called on Syrians abroad to return to their homeland. ‘Mine is an appeal to all Syrians abroad: Syria is now a free country that has earned its pride and dignity. Come back,’ he said. ‘We must rebuild, be reborn and we need everyone’s help.’ He also said that Syria’s new rulers would be willing to work with anyone so long as they did not defend Assad. ‘We have no problem with anyone, state, party or sect, who kept their distance from the bloodthirsty Assad regime,’ he said. Assad was propped up by Russia, where he reportedly fled, as well as Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group. On Wednesday, the Kremlin said it wanted to see rapid stabilisation in Syria, as it criticised Israel over hundreds of air strikes it conducted on its neighbour over the past two days. ‘We would like to see the situation in the country stabilised somehow as soon as possible,’ Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Russia was continuing to discuss the fate of its military infrastructure in the country with Syria’s new leadership, he added. Iran, meanwhile, upheld its view that Assad’s overthrow was a ‘product of a joint US-Israeli plot’. Its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Wednesday that the ouster of Assad would not weaken its anti-Israel ‘resistance’. While Assad had faced down protests and an armed rebellion for more than a decade, it was a lightning offensive launched on November 27 that ended up forcing him out of power. The rebels launched their offensive from northwest Syria on the very same day that a ceasefire took effect in the Israel-Hezbollah war in neighbouring Lebanon. That war, which killed thousands in Lebanon, saw Israel inflict staggering losses among Hezbollah’s ranks. Assad’s fall raises the question of how Hezbollah will ever recover, given that it had long relied on Syria as a conduit of weapons and supplies from Iran. Qatar and Turkey, on the other hand, historically backed the opposition. Qatar on Wednesday said it would reopen its embassy in Damascus ‘soon’, while US secretary of state Antony Blinken is expected in Turkey on Friday to discuss developments in Syria. Robert Ford, the last US ambassador to Syria, helped spearhead the terrorist designation of HTS in 2012, but said that in the past few years the group has not attacked US or Western targets and has instead fought al-Qaeda and Islamic State group forces. Ford also pointed with hope to post-victory statements by rebel chief Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, including welcoming international monitoring of any chemical weapons that are discovered. ‘Can you imagine Osama bin Laden saying that?’ said Ford, now a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. ‘I’m not saying ‘trust Jolani.’ He’s obviously authoritarian. He’s obviously an Islamist who doesn’t believe that Christians have an equal right to power as Muslims. But I sure as hell want to test him on some of these things,’ he added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252597/new-syria-pm-says-all-religious-groups-rights-guaranteed

SUST students give 72-hr ultimatum for 3 demands,"Students of the Shahjalal University of Science and Technology on Wednesday gave the administration a 72-hour ultimatum to meet their 3-point demand. The demands are reduction of the fees of admission, semester and credits for courses; cancellation of all kinds of quota system from the admission process; and completion of the next two semesters in four months each instead of six months. They issued the ultimatum holding a human chain formed in front of the Central Library on the SUST campus. Addressing the human chain, the student representatives said that the admission fee in the first year honours was Tk 8,100 in the academic year 2020-21 but the fee was increased to Tk 18,000 in the academic year 2023-24. At the same time, the fees for semester and credit were also increased by several times, they alleged, mentioning that the fee for per theoretical credit was Tk 105 while the fee for per practical credit was Tk 160 in the academic year 2020-21, which were increased to Tk 140 and Tk 200 respectively in the academic year 2022-23. Such increasing of the fees was completely illogical and the present administration also had not determined the reasonable amounts for the fees  after cancelling the previous amounts that was increased by the previous administration despite repeated appeals, the student representatives alleged. The speakers in the rally also claimed that the ‘quota for dependence’ of the university officials and employees had also no logical ground. They cautioned the university administration saying that they would be forced to launch a tough movement if their demands were not met by within 72 hours. A social work student Azad Shikder coordinated the rally, addressed, among others, by chemistry student Asadullah Al Galib, social work student Mujahid Imon, Muhammad Ali and Murad Mia, business administration student Mahbubul Hasan Paban and social science student Faysal Hossain.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252593/sust-students-give-72-hr-ultimatum-for-3-demands
Three Indian nationals held in Habiganj,"Three Indian nationals were arrested at Madhabpur upazila in Habiganj on Tuesday night on charge of illegally entering Bangladesh. The arrested are Pradip Pal, 50, son of late Upendra Pal of Agartala Railway Station area under the Amtali police station of Pashchim Tripura district in the Tripura state of India, Ajit Biswas, 40, son of Amulya Biswas of Ranir Khamar village under the same Amtali police station, and Samir Das, 30, son of late Piari Mohan Das of Gopalnagar village under Sidhai police station of the Pashchim Tripura district, police said. Border Guard Bangladesh 25 Battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Farah Mohammed Imtiaj confirmed the arrest. He said that on information, a team of Dharmaghar border outpost of the BGB conducted a drive at Santoshgram near the Dharmaghar border under the Madhabpur upazila at around 11:00pm on Tuesday and arrested the three Indian nationals as they failed to show any legal documents for travelling Bangladesh. ‘The arrested were handed over to the Madhabpur police station early Wednesday after filing a case against them with the police station,’ the BGB officer said.

IUB hosts book launch of ‘Living with Refugees’,"Independent University, Bangladesh’s school of liberal arts and social sciences has recently hosted an event to launch the book titled Living with Refugees at the Multipurpose Hall on its campus in Dhaka, said a press release on Sunday. Organised with support from the department of social sciences and humanities, South Asian Studies Centre, TUFS Field Science Commons, and ILCAA-Anthropology, Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, Japan, the event focused on refugee studies and their impacts. Qudrate Khoda, associate professor of DSSH, served as master of ceremonies, while the event was coordinated by Nazia Mahmood, senior lecturer. Professor Bokhtiar Ahmed, dean of SLASS, opened the event with a welcome address. The book, published by The University Press Limited, was edited by Jahangirnagar University professor Ranjan Saha Partha, IUB’s Obaydullah Al Marzuk, and Tokyo University of Foreign Studies professor Masahiko Togawa. It contains contributions from 19 researchers from Bangladesh and abroad. Masahiko Togawa shared insights into the historical context of the Rohingya crisis, tracing its roots to Japanese military involvement in the region during World War II. He discussed how decisions made during and after that period contributed to the current situation and emphasised the interconnectedness of global actions and their consequences. Togawa also highlighted that the crisis could not be resolved by one nation alone, stressing the need for collective action from all stakeholders, including those indirectly connected to the issue. He also commended the authors and the UPL for producing the book in Bangla, enabling a broader understanding of the crisis within local contexts, describing the book as a factual and reflective work that contributes to understanding the complexity of the Rohingya issue. Ranjan Saha Partha spoke about his work on the book over seven years. ‘I wanted to address divisions among refugees and political influences and make the issue clear to people in their language.’ Mentioning that this book offers readers a detailed understanding of these critical issues through well-researched perspectives,  Mahrukh Mohiuddin from the UPL said, ‘In UPL’s 49-year history, we have highlighted Bangladesh’s realities through First-World publication. The Rohingya crisis, with its socio-economic and humanitarian complexities, remains urgent, especially with the recent ICC arrest warrant against Myanmar’s military ruler.’ Professor Meghna Guhathakurta, executive director of Research Initiatives Bangladesh, reviewed parts of the book, noting its analysis of refugee lives and the role of host communities. Professor S Aminul Islam, former chairman of the sociology department, University of Dhaka, said, ‘This book stands out for its quality and insightful contributions. It explores the sociological and anthropological dimensions of the Rohingya crisis, offering a detailed look into the affected populations' daily realities.’ Professor Imtiaz A Hussain, from the global studies and governance department of IUB, remarked, ‘The Rohingya crisis represents a collision between environmental concerns and humanitarian needs.’ ‘It has triggered a Level 2 humanitarian crisis as defined by the United Nations, requiring both local and global responsibilities to address its challenges. Local actions must take precedence, as they directly impact the region's socio-economic and ecological balance.’ Professor Kazi Mahmudur Rahman, head of DSSH, invited the guests for the unveiling of the book and delivered the closing remarks. The event concluded with the presentation of books and gifts to the guests.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252591/iub-hosts-book-launch-of-living-with-refugees
Bangladesh struggles to find way out of unequal power deals: speakers,"Finding a way out of unequal power deals, though they continue to bleed the economy, would not be so easy, speakers observed at the inaugural session of a three-day energy conference that began in Dhaka on Wednesday. Bangladesh Working Group on Ecology and Development along with 23 co-organisers arranged the conference at the BIAM Foundation auditorium at the city’s New Eskaton. ‘Coming out of the power deals could be very expensive. These deals are unequal, offering barely any way out for Bangladesh,’ said Syeda Rizwana Hasan, the interim government’s adviser for the ministry of environment, forest and climate change. Rizwana said that the deals, exerting mounting pressure on the country’s economy, would have to be carried on for rather a long time. ‘People are put under a huge burden. Controlling the situation will take time,’ she added. Energy expert Mohammad Tamim said that cancelling the deals would carry heavy financial and legal consequences, costing Bangladesh hefty sums as fines. ‘The phasing out of a single project might cost $10–$12 billion,’ said Tamim. He also said that the projects would drag for decades under the deals, including the nuclear power generation project that would continue for 40 years. Organisers said that the conference was expecting over 300 participants, including a dozen experts from abroad. Power, energy and mineral resources adviser Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan said that the primary goal of the now ousted Awami League regime in the power and energy sector seemed to be enabling corruption rather than achieving sustainable development. The current interim government was focused on eliminating those practices that enabled corruption, he said. ‘We have restored the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission’s  power to fix energy tariffs. We are also revising the Integrated Energy and Power Master Plan and reevaluating the renewable energy policy,’ said Fouzul. Hasan Mehedi, member secretary of the working group, said that the conference would have strategic dialogues to pave the path towards reducing emissions by 2050.

"CA press wing debunks misleading, fake news on Indian media","The chief adviser’s Press Wing debunked two news stories on Wednesday published by several Indian media outlets and labeled them as misleading and fake. India.com published an article titled ‘Bangladesh to get bankrupt like Pakistan!’ which claims that many clothing brands are now shifting their focus to Indian manufacturers from Bangladesh to meet their demands. The CA Press Facts on its Facebook page called the article misleading saying that export earnings of Bangladesh for November 2024 amounted to $4.12 billion, reflecting a robust 15.63 per cent growth compared to the previous month. Cumulatively, exports during the July–November 2024 period reached $16.11 billion, achieving a 12.34 per cent growth compared to $14.34 billion in the same period last year. The apparel sector contributed significantly with $3.06 billion in November, marking an impressive 16.25 per cent growth from $2.84 billion in October, it said. Meanwhile, several Indian media outlets, including ABP Ananda and Sangbad Pratidin, on December 10 claimed that an ISKCON member was attacked in Dhaka's Uttara area. In its Facebook post, the CA Press Wing said that Krishna Priya Nitai Das, the priest of Radharaman Temple (ISKCON Uttara) in Dhaka's Uttara area, said that he did not know of any incident of attack on any ISKCON devotees or members in the Uttara area. Police in Dhaka also said they had not received any such complaints, it said. The Indian media did not reveal the identity of the ‘victim.’ Neither the Bangladesh Police nor any ISKCON leader has made any statement in these reports, which, in overall consideration, identifies the news as untrue, motivated, and against journalistic ethics. Hrishikesh Gouranga Das, the central leader of Bangladesh ISKCON, said that an attempt is being made to give a communal shape to a recent family incident in Uttara. He also said that the youth involved in family matters is not an ISKCON member.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/252587/ca-press-wing-debunks-misleading-fake-news-on-indian-media
Bank deposits bounce back in Oct after depressing trend,"The amount of deposits in the country’s banks increased by about Tk 14,208 crore in October, reflecting a gradual recovery of depositor confidence. Bangladesh Bank data revealed that total deposits, excluding interbank and government deposits, rose to Tk 17,55,217 crore in October, up from Tk 17,41,009 crore in September. This was a significant improvement from Tk 17,31,260 crore in August and Tk 17,34,026 crore in July. Bankers attributed the recovery to depositors transferring funds from crisis-hit banks to more stable ones. They also said that monthly interest payments added to principal amounts contributed to a steady rise in deposit balances. The government and the Bangladesh Bank repeatedly assured depositors that their money is safe in banks and no bank would collapse, which have played a critical role in restoring confidence, bankers said. Therefore, currency held outside banks declined, dropping to Tk 2.77 lakh crore in October, compared with that of Tk 2.83 lakh crore in September and Tk 2.92 lakh crore in August. Bankers said that the central bank’s liquidity guarantee system, introduced to enable stronger banks to support struggling ones without incurring risks, was a key factor in stabilising the sector. Under this system, stronger banks have provided significant liquidity support, with four weaker banks receiving Tk 945 crore on October 2. By November 11, nine struggling banks collectively received Tk 6,585 crore in the form of interbank assistances. In addition, the central bank directly provided Tk 22,500 crore to six banks by the end of November. Additionally, banks have increased interest rates on deposits, making them more attractive to savers, bankers said. In October, Tk 15.6 lakh crore of deposits were in time deposits, while Tk 1.94 lakh crore were in demand deposits. The banking sector had previously faced a severe confidence crisis due to widespread irregularities and rising non-performing loans during the Awami League regime which was ousted on August 5 through a student-led mass uprising. High inflation, political uncertainty and macroeconomic instability, had also triggered significant withdrawals, reduced deposit inflows, and shrunk the overall deposit base. Fixed-income and low-income households, in particular, struggled with rising commodity prices, leading to higher withdrawals than deposits. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, the inflation rate reached 11.38 per cent in November, with overall inflation exceeding 9 per cent for 20 consecutive months, primarily driven by escalating commodity prices. Despite these challenges, loan disbursements continued to grow, increasing to Tk 21.34 lakh crore in October from Tk 21.1 lakh crore in September. However, the interbank currency rate surged to Tk 120, compared with that of Tk 84.8 in August 2021, underscoring ongoing macroeconomic pressures. The current trends suggest that while depositor confidence is improving, challenges such as inflation, economic instability, and political uncertainty continue to influence the banking sector, bankers said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/252586/bank-deposits-bounce-back-in-oct-after-depressing-trend

Asia Pacific growth to remain steady in 2025: MEI report,"The Asia Pacific region’s growth in the forthcoming year will remain at 2024 levels, according to Mastercard Economics Institute’s recently published economic outlook for the year 2025, which also forecasted that inflation and interest rates would ease offering relief to consumers and households. These regional forecasts align with global economic trends, which predicted a moderate acceleration in growth to 3.2 per cent in 2025, up from 3.1 per cent in 2024. In the outlook, Bangladesh was highlighted as one of the countries experiencing significant population outflows, alongside India, Mexico, Russia, Syria, the Chinese Mainland, Pakistan and Ukraine. These migrations are driven by a range of factors, including a pursuit of better opportunities and concerns over security, according to the report. The report underscored the importance of remittances for APAC economies, with India, China, the Philippines and Pakistan among the top five recipients. Despite outbound migration impacting human capital, remittance continued to be a crucial support for low- and middle-income communities in South Asia, contributing over 6 per cent of Sri Lanka’s GDP and 5 per cent of Bangladesh’s, the outlook said. MEI forecasted a tightening of labour market in the APAC, with inflation-adjusted wages rising, boosting consumer spending on discretionary items like electronics and appliances. While demand for experience spending has slowed, big-ticket events like concerts remain a priority, it said. Travel in the APAC is expected to stay strong, though passenger numbers in mid-2024 were still 12 per cent below 2019 levels, partly due to slower recovery in outbound travel from Northeast Asia, especially China and Japan, according to the outlook. ‘If 2024 was about ‘getting back to normal’, 2025 is about normalisation as volatility subsides and easing monetary policy allows consumers to benefit from economic growth,’ said David Mann, chief economist – Asia Pacific of Mastercard.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/252582/asia-pacific-growth-to-remain-steady-in-2025-mei-report
"US imposes trade curbs on China, Russia firms","The United States unveiled trade restrictions Tuesday on eight companies, including two Chinese firms and several from Russia, alleging human rights violations. The China-based companies identified include Zhejiang Uniview Technologies, which US officials accuse of enabling human rights violations such as surveillance of Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups. The other firm named by the US Commerce Department was Beijing Zhongdun Security Technology Group, which is said to develop and sell products allowing public security authorities to carry out rights violations. The businesses were added to an ‘entity list,’ which requires US companies to have a licence before exporting to them. ‘Human rights abuses are contrary to the foreign policy interests of the United States,’ said undersecretary of commerce for industry and security Alan Estevez in a statement. Adding these companies to the entity list aims to ‘ensure that US technology is not used to enable human rights violations and abuses,’ he added. A spokeswoman for Beijing’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday the sanctions were an ‘open and fearless suppression of Chinese high-tech companies under the guise of human rights’. ‘This further exposes the falsehood that the US protects human rights, and the reality that it deprives the Chinese people of their development rights. Such ploys will never succeed,’ Mao Ning said at a regular press briefing. ‘If the United States really cares about human rights, it should first patch up its own rights debts.’ A man who answered a call to a cellphone number associated with Beijing Zhongdun on Wednesday hung up after an AFP reporter identified himself. Calls to two numbers associated with Zhejiang Uniview went unanswered. The US government and lawmakers in several other Western countries have taken aim at China’s treatment of the Uyghur minority in the northwestern Xinjiang region. Rights groups have said at least one million people, mostly members of Muslim minorities, have been incarcerated in the region and face various abuses — while Beijing vehemently denies the accusations. Among other firms targeted on Tuesday were two in Myanmar and two others in Russia over their roles in supplying Myanmar’s military with components allowing them to carry out acts like aerial attacks against civilians, the Commerce Department said. Two other Russian entities were included for providing facial recognition technology to Moscow ‘to target peaceful protesters, an integral component of Russia’s mass surveillance apparatus.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/trade-commerce/252581/us-imposes-trade-curbs-on-china-russia-firms

Govt to buy edible oils from controversial S Alam Group,"A meeting of the Cabinet Committee on government purchase on Wednesday approved 16 proposals, including two on purchasing edible oils from S Alam Super Edible Oil Ltd, a subsidiary of the controversial S Alam Group. S Alam Super Refinery will supply 1.1 crore litres of palm oil at Tk 130 per litre under a direct purchase method. Finance adviser Saleuddin Ahmed who presided over the meeting approved the proposal submitted by the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh. Another proposal by the TCB to purchase 38 lakh litres of soybean oil from the same S Alam Super Refinery at Tk 140 per litre was also approved. Officials attending the meeting said that the TCB made the proposal of purchasing edible oils from the group without any tender as it was struggling to procure edible oils due to its scarcity. Besides, the prices were favourable, said the officials. S Alam Super Refinery, which used to enjoy around one fourth of the county’s edible oils’ market during the now ousted Awami League regime, faced setbacks after the changeover on August 5 amid a student-mass uprising. S Alam Group chairman Saiful Alam, who is one of the major oligarchs of the deposed Awami regime, has absconded. The ACC has started an inquiry against the S Alam Group chairman over allegations of laundering money to Singapore. Janata Bank PLC has also filed a Tk 1,963 crore defaulted loan case against S Alam Group in Chattogram Artha Rin Adalat. The cabinet committee also approved another TCB proposal to buy 10,000 tonnes of lentil from Nabil Naba Foods Limited under open local tender with each at Tk 95.97 per kilogram. The finance adviser told the reporters after the meeting that they were purchasing essential items, including edible oils, lentils, fertilisers and liquefied natural gas. M/S Vitol Asia Pte Ltd, Singapore will supply one cargo of LNG with per unit costing $15.02. Abu Dhabi National Oil Company will supply six lakh tonnes of crude oil for Tk 5,208.37 crore and Saudi Arabian Oil Company will supply seven lakh tonnes of light crude oil at Tk 6,025.21 crore.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252578/govt-to-buy-edible-oils-from-controversial-s-alam-group
Israeli strike kills 22 in Gaza,"Gaza’s civil defence agency said on Wednesday that an overnight Israeli air strike in the northern part of the Palestinian territory killed at least 22 people, including women and children. ‘At least 22 people were martyred in the massacre committed by the occupation military after it bombed a house belonging to the Abu al-Tarabish family near Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza,’ agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said. Bassal said that an Israeli jet had fired three missiles at the house around midnight, adding the strike completely destroyed the three-storey structure. More than 50 people were living in the house, he said, with many still under the rubble. ‘Rescuers were unable to evacuate the martyrs or the wounded until this morning,’ said Jaber Alian, 30, who witnessed the strike from a house near the hospital. He said there were several other bombings across the northern parts of the territory during the night. The Israeli military confirmed it carried out a strike in the Jabalia area near the Kamal Adwan hospital on Tuesday night. ‘According to an initial examination, the number of casualties resulting from the strike published in the media is inaccurate and does not align with the information held by the Israeli military,’ it said in a statement. ‘The military is continuing to examine the incident.’ It did not give a toll of its own from the strike. For several weeks, the Israeli military has been engaged in a sweeping operation in northern Gaza, particularly in Jabalia, where it says Hamas militants had been regrouping. In another strike in central Gaza on Wednesday morning, at least seven people were killed when an Israeli warplane struck the house of the Al-Bayoumi family in Nuseirat refugee camp, Bassal said. The military, meanwhile, said two projectiles crossed from central Gaza into Israel on Wednesday, but were intercepted by the air force. The war in Gaza broke out after Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7 last year, resulting in the deaths of 1,208 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. The count includes hostages who died or were killed while being held in Gaza after they were seized by Palestinian militants during the attack. Militants abducted 251 hostages, 96 of whom remain in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 44,805 people, a majority of them civilians, according to data from the Hamas-run health ministry that is considered reliable by the UN.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252577/israeli-strike-kills-22-in-gaza
Taiwan says China expands military drills around island,"China has expanded military drills around Taiwan aimed at drawing ‘a red line’ for the next US president, Taipei authorities said on Wednesday, branding Beijing a ‘troublemaker’. Beijing’s biggest maritime drills in years involve about 60 warships and 30 coast guard vessels deployed from near the southern islands of Japan to the South China Sea, a senior national security official said. China has also ramped up military aircraft activity closer to Taiwan, with 100 sorties detected over the past two days, according to figures from the island’s defence ministry. There has been no announcement by Beijing’s army or Chinese state media about increased military activity in the East China Sea, Taiwan Strait, South China Sea or Western Pacific Ocean. However, a recent Pacific tour by Taiwanese president Lai Ching-te that included two stops in US territory drew fury from Beijing, which claims the democratic island as part of China’s territory. The security official said Wednesday that China’s plans for the massive maritime operation began in October and were aimed at demonstrating that Beijing could choke off Taiwan and also to ‘draw a red line’ ahead of the next US administration. ‘China uses president Lai’s overseas visit as a pretext, with Taiwan only serving as an excuse,’ the official said. ‘The real objective appears to be asserting control within the first island chain and establishing strategic deterrence ahead of the US presidential transition,’ the official said, referring to the chain linking Okinawa, Taiwan and the Philippines. Taiwan’s foreign ministry said Wednesday that China’s increased military activity around the island was evidence that Beijing was a ‘troublemaker’. But China’s foreign ministry — whose spokesperson neither confirmed nor denied that drills were taking place — directed blame at Taiwan. ‘Harming the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait is the work of Taiwan independence separatist forces, with the support of external actors,’ Mao Ning said Wednesday during a briefing in Beijing. The United States was monitoring China’s ‘latest activity’ and would ensure ‘nobody does anything to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait’, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters at a US base in Japan Wednesday. ‘We’ll continue to do what we can to help Taiwan acquire the means to defend itself,’ he added. Chinese warships have simulated attacking foreign ships during the drills, while the coast guard has practised intercepting commercial vessels as well as disrupting and blockading sea routes, the Taiwan security official said. Recent bad weather had ‘posed challenges for smaller vessels’ involved in the drills, they said, adding that China also held ‘joint operations with Russia’ in November. Taiwan lives under the constant threat of invasion by China, which has not ruled out using force to bring the island under its control. Beijing has ramped up the deployment of fighter jets and warships around the island in recent years, and also opposes any international recognition of self-ruled Taiwan — especially when it comes to official contact between Taipei and Washington. Lai spoke last week with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson in addition to his two recent stopovers on US soil. The security official said the sea drills were ‘significantly larger’ than Beijing’s maritime response to then-US House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei in 2022, which was China’s largest-ever war games around Taiwan. China has held four major military exercises in just over two years, including two since Lai took office in May. Beijing usually announces its military exercises but the official said one reason it may have decided to stay silent was to avoid overshadowing China’s annual Central Economic Work Conference — a closed-door leadership meeting scheduled Wednesday, according to reports. Taipei-based military analyst Shu Hsiao-huang said Beijing’s drills had a ‘pronounced sense of real combat readiness and operational intent ’. ‘In the East China Sea, it seems China is preparing for large-scale aerial operations to confront US naval forces,’ Shu said. ‘Meanwhile, the deployment of significant naval assets east of Taiwan suggests a strategy to blockade the island, cutting off its economic lifelines and essential resources.’ Taiwan defence ministry’s daily tally of Chinese aircraft detected around the island was 53 on Wednesday and 47 on Tuesday. Wednesday’s figure was the highest number of aircraft detected in a single day since a record 153 were reported on October 15 after China staged large-scale military drills in response to Lai’s National Day speech days earlier.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/252576/taiwan-says-china-expands-military-drills-around-island
South Korean ex-defence minister tries to kill himself,"South Korea’s former defence minister tried to kill himself shortly before he was formally arrested over his role in this month’s martial law operation, a senior prisons official said on Wednesday. President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law on December 3 and sent soldiers and helicopters to parliament but was forced to rescind the decree hours later after lawmakers voted it down. Defence minister Kim Yong-hyun resigned last Thursday and was formally arrested Tuesday on charges including ‘engaging in critical duties during an insurrection’ and ‘abuse of authority to obstruct the exercise of rights’. During a parliamentary hearing, the commissioner general of the Korea Correctional Service said the former minister tried to kill himself minutes before his arrest was announced. Shortly before midnight (1500 GMT Tuesday), ‘former minister of defence Kim Yong-hyun attempted suicide at the Seoul Dongbu Detention Centre,’ said Shin Yong-hae. Adding that he received the report Wednesday morning, Shin said Kim had tried to kill himself in the toilet using a string from his clothing. ‘A control room staff member intervened, and when they opened the door, he immediately gave up the attempt,’ said Shin. Shin added that Kim was now under protection in a secure cell and in good health. ‘The medical examination results indicate that the inmate’s health status is good without any abnormalities, and he is currently living a normal life in the facility,’ the justice ministry said in a statement sent to AFP. Kim had issued an apology on Tuesday, saying through his lawyers that ‘all responsibility for this situation lies solely with me’. He ‘deeply apologised’ to the South Korean people and said that his subordinates were ‘merely following my orders and fulfilling their assigned duties’.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/252575/south-korean-ex-defence-minister-tries-to-kill-himself
Khamenei says Assad’s fall will not weaken Iran,"Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday the weakening of the anti-Israel ‘resistance’ after the ouster of Bashar al-Assad in Syria would not diminish Tehran’s power. Some, ‘unaware of the meaning of resistance, imagine that when the resistance becomes weak, Islamic Iran will also become weak Iran is strong and powerful and will become even more powerful,’ Khamenei said in his first speech after Assad’s fall. Syrian rebels’ lightning push to Damascus from their strongholds in the northwest ended the decades-long rule of Assad’s family, once an ally of Tehran. Assad had long played a strategic role in Iran’s anti-Israel ‘axis of resistance’, particularly in facilitating the supply of weapons to Tehran’s ally Hezbollah in neighbouring Lebanon. The axis of resistance includes Hezbollah, as well as Hamas in Gaza, Huthi rebels in Yemen and smaller Shia militia groups in Iraq. All of the groups are united in their opposition to Israel and its main backer the United States. The Iranian supreme leader, who has the final say in his country’s affairs, accused the United States and ‘the Zionist regime’, Israel, of plotting against Assad. ‘No one should doubt that what has taken place in Syria is the product of a joint US-Israeli plot,’ he said. He also blamed another ‘neighbouring state of Syria’ for its ‘obvious role’ in the recent developments, without naming the country. Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey all share borders with Syria. Of those neighbours, Turkey has long supported the ouster of Assad. According to Khamenei, different ‘invaders’ in Syria were pursuing different aims. ‘Their goals are different, some of them are seeking to seize the lands of northern or southern Syria, America is seeking to strengthen its position in the region,’ he said. Turkey has forces in northern Syria, while in the south the Israeli army has sent troops into a UN-patrolled buffer zone on the countries’ shared border east of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. The US also has troops based in Syria, where they have worked with Kurdish-led fighters battling the Islamic State group.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252574/khamenei-says-assads-fall-will-not-weaken-iran
Allegations of judicial corruption often reach me unexpectedly: Justice Syed Md Ziaul Karim,"Outgoing Appellate Division judge Justice Syed Md Ziaul Karim, in his farewell speech on Wednesday, addressed claims of corruption within the judiciary, noting that such allegations often reach him unexpectedly. He urged unity across all levels of the judiciary, from lower court officials to senior judges, to safeguard the integrity of the justice system. ‘Judicial management cannot succeed through individual efforts alone,’ Justice Ziaul remarked, stressing the need for collective responsibility. He underscored the pivotal role of the chief justice, describing the position as the judiciary’s guardian, responsible for issuing clear directives, rewarding capable judges, and offering reprimands when necessary. Justice Ziaul highlighted the importance of judicial independence, stating that judges must be free to express their thoughts and deliver judgments without external interference. He called for support from individuals and groups involved in court welfare activities to resist challenges to judicial autonomy. ‘The judicial system risks collapse if the moral failings of a few judges are not addressed,’ he warned. ‘Unity within the judiciary is crucial to overcoming these challenges.’ Justice Ziaul emphasised the necessity of implementing High Court inspection reports and recommendations made under Article 109 of the constitution. He argued that these measures would enhance transparency and accountability in the administrative and judicial processes of lower courts. He also praised chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed’s proactive supervision, which he said had been instrumental in addressing the challenges faced by lower courts and their judges. Chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, who leads the six-member Appellate Division, shared his experiences of working alongside Justice Syed Md Ziaul Karim in both the High Court and the Appellate Division. Speaking during the farewell event, attorney general Md Asaduzzaman and Supreme Court Bar Association president AM Mahbub Uddin Khokon lauded Justice Ziaul Karim’s contributions, highlighting his 20 years as a judge and 18 years as an advocate.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252573/allegations-of-judicial-corruption-often-reach-me-unexpectedly-justice-syed-md-ziaul-karim

Macron races to choose new PM,"French president Emmanuel Macron raced Wednesday to meet a self-imposed 48-hour deadline to name a new prime minister after he hosted party bosses in a bid to hammer out a consensus and avoid a protracted political crisis. Following the ouster of the government of Michel Barnier in a historic no-confidence vote last week, Macron on Tuesday gathered leaders from across the political spectrum in a bid to form a ‘government of national interest’. The bosses of the far-right National Rally and hard-left France Unbowed, who joined forces to oust Barnier, were not invited. Macron, who is set to travel to Poland on Thursday, aimed to name a new prime minister ‘within 48 hours’, said the party chiefs who had met him Tuesday. Several people close to the president said the announcement could come as early as Wednesday evening. Last week far-right and hard-left lawmakers joined forces to oust the minority government of Barnier following a standoff over an austerity budget. Macron is now under huge pressure to form a government that can survive a no-confidence vote and pass a budget for next year in a bid to limit political and economic turmoil. The French leader dissolved parliament in June after the far right trounced his alliance in European elections and called snap parliamentary polls that resulted in a hung parliament. He told party leaders on Tuesday that he did not want to dissolve the National Assembly lower house again before the end of his second and final term in 2027, a person close to him said. Barnier, prime minister for only three months, remains in charge on a caretaker basis until a new government is appointed. On Wednesday, the cabinet were due to discuss a special budget law to allow the French state to keep functioning in the new year. The National Assembly will debate the bill on Monday, a parliamentary source said, with most parties saying they will back it in the name of stability. Some commentators said that bringing together so many parties marked progress from Macron’s new attempt to reach consensus after the snap election, but progress still appeared elusive. Greens leader Marine Tondelier said on Tuesday the presidential camp was not ready for any ‘compromise or concession’, but Macron had stressed the need ‘to no longer rely on the RN to govern’. Her party is part of the left-wing New Popular Front, which emerged as the largest bloc in the National Assembly after the summer elections. Macron has hoped to prise the Socialists, Greens and Communists away from their pact with the LFI but their bosses insist a new prime minister should be named from their ranks. On Wednesday morning, Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure spoke out against the candidacy of Macron’s centrist ally Francois Bayrou tipped as a possible contender for prime minister. Faure told broadcaster BFMTV/RMC that Bayrou, 73, would embody a ‘continuity’, whereas he wanted to see a prime minister ‘from the left’. He refused to say whether the Socialists would censure a government led by the centrist. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who emerged as kingmaker after the elections, said she relished being awarded the ‘medal of the opposition’ while mainstream parties held ‘a banquet to share out jobs’ in government. An Ifop-Fiducial poll for Le Figaro Magazine and Sud Radio published on Wednesday indicated that Le Pen would win between 36 percent and 38 percent of the vote in the first round of the French presidential election. The poll, carried out after Barnier’s ouster, suggested Le Pen would obtain 36 per cent of the vote against centre-right former premier Edouard Philippe (25 per cent) and 38 per cent against Barnier’s predecessor Gabriel Attal (20 per cent). Some observers have suggested that Le Pen, 56, is seeking to bring down Macron before his term ends by joining forces with the hard left and ousting Barnier. ‘Macron hopes to replace the informal deal with Le Pen’s far right which initially sustained the short-lived Barnier government with a more formal deal with the moderate left and independents,’ risk consultancy Eurasia Group said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252571/macron-races-to-choose-new-pm

In need of a permanent education commission,"EDUCATION is the cornerstone of national development, serving as a foundation for cultivating informed societies, robust economies, and accountable governance systems. In Bangladesh, despite significant progress, the education sector faces persistent challenges that threaten the country’s trajectory toward sustainable growth. Issues such as outdated curricula, disparities in quality and access, inadequate teacher training, and inefficient policy implementation hinder the ability of the education system to meet the demands of a dynamic, globally connected world. Moreover, the sector struggles to adapt to modern challenges, including digital transformation, climate change, and evolving labour market needs. To confront these multifaceted challenges effectively, the establishment of a permanent education commission emerges as a transformative necessity. Envisioned in the National Education Policy 2010, this commission is designed to provide a long-term, institutionalised mechanism for addressing systemic educational issues. Its mandate would extend beyond short-term fixes, ensuring continuity and coherence in policy implementation across successive governments. A permanent body would enable consistent monitoring and evaluation of reforms, promoting evidence-based decision-making and reducing the frequent disruptions caused by political transitions.  Challenges in education landscape BANGLADESH’S education sector has achieved remarkable progress in increasing enrolment rates and gender parity in primary and secondary education. However, systemic challenges remain: Policy discontinuity: Political transitions often disrupt educational reforms, undermining the long-term impact of policies. For instance, ambitious reforms proposed by one administration may be discarded or deprioritised by the next. Curriculum gaps: The education system struggles to balance traditional learning with skills that align with the demands of the 21st century, such as critical thinking, problem solving, and technological literacy. Equity issues: Stark disparities persist between urban and rural education outcomes, with marginalised communities often receiving substandard education. Teacher quality and training: While enrolment has surged, the capacity and quality of teaching staff have not kept pace, compromising learning outcomes. Fragmented governance: Education administration is divided across multiple entities, including two separate ministries, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of cohesive strategy.  National Education Policy 2010 THE National Education Policy 2010, a landmark document in Bangladesh’s education history, explicitly recommended the establishment of a permanent education commission. It recognised that sustainable educational progress requires an institutionalised mechanism to: ensure consistency in policy implementation across successive governments; provide regular assessments and revisions of curricula based on evidence and emerging trends; address regional and socio-economic disparities in education; and, monitor and evaluate the performance of education programs systematically. Despite this visionary proposal, the absence of such a commission has left the education system vulnerable to ad-hoc decision-making and reactive measures.  Benefits of permanent commission A PERMANENT education commission would serve as an independent, non-partisan body, tasked with overseeing and guiding the education sector. Its core responsibilities could include: Policy formulation and review: The commission could work as a repository of expertise, continuously updating education policies to reflect global best practices while aligning with national priorities. This would reduce the disruptions caused by political changes. Monitoring and evaluation: By establishing robust mechanisms for data collection and analysis, the commission could provide actionable insights into the effectiveness of existing programs, identifying gaps and recommending timely interventions. Curriculum development: The commission could ensure that the curriculum is dynamic, inclusive, and responsive to the evolving needs of society and the job market, particularly in integrating technology and fostering creativity. Equity and inclusion: A dedicated focus on bridging disparities would enable the commission to champion inclusive education, addressing the needs of underserved communities, including women and girls, ethnic and language minorities, and persons with disabilities. Coordination among stakeholders: By acting as a central coordinating body, the commission could harmonise efforts among the ministry of education, development partners, private sector actors, and civil society organisations. Teacher training and development: The commission could play a critical role in standardising and enhancing teacher training programs, ensuring educators are equipped with modern pedagogical skills.  Global examples of permanent commissions SEVERAL countries have successfully institutionalised similar bodies, offering valuable lessons for Bangladesh: In India, the National Council of Educational Research and Training serves as a premier institution for educational planning and research, providing a model of structured governance in education. It contributes to policy development, curriculum design, and teacher training while ensuring alignment with national goals and global best practices. NCERT’s role in updating textbooks, introducing competency-based assessments, and fostering innovation in pedagogy highlights its ability to sustain progress across decades. In the South Korea, the National Education Commission of South Korea is a cornerstone of its transformation into a global leader in education. It ensures continuity in policy implementation and upholds rigorous standards of education. By focusing on technology integration, teacher quality, and research-backed policy-making, South Korea has sustained stellar outcomes in literacy, innovation, and workforce readiness, making it a beacon for developing nations. Celebrated for its world-class education system, Finland benefits from research-driven advisory bodies that emphasise evidence-based policy-making and teacher empowerment. These entities have been pivotal in maintaining Finland’s commitment to equity and excellence by ensuring that education policies are grounded in both research and practice. The emphasis on lifelong learning and localised curriculum development further bolsters its success. These examples demonstrate that a dedicated commission can drive significant improvements by providing a stable, long-term vision for education.  Recommendations for commission TO ENSURE its success, the proposed permanent education commission in Bangladesh must: Independent and non-political: The commission should operate autonomously, free from political influence, to ensure objectivity and impartiality in its recommendations. Include diverse stakeholders: Membership should represent academia, practitioners, policymakers, private sector experts, and civil society, fostering a holistic approach to education reform. Leverage technology: The commission must integrate cutting-edge technology to address challenges such as teacher shortages, resource limitations, and remote learning needs. Focus on lifelong learning: Beyond traditional schooling, the commission should emphasise vocational training, adult education, and reskilling initiatives to prepare the workforce for future challenges. Accountability: Clear benchmarks and reporting mechanisms should be established to track progress and ensure transparency in operations.  Conclusion BANGLADESH’S education system sits at a critical juncture, offering immense potential to serve as a driving force for socio-economic transformation. However, persistent structural and operational challenges — ranging from outdated curricula to inequitable access — threaten to undermine this potential. The establishment of a permanent education commission, as envisioned in the National Education Policy 2010, is no longer a recommendation that can wait — it is an urgent necessity. A permanent education commission would represent a transformative leap for Bangladesh by institutionalizing a forward-looking, independent body solely dedicated to education reform. This commission would address systemic challenges with a cohesive, evidence-based approach, ensuring that education policies are aligned with the nation’s long-term aspirations and the demands of a rapidly evolving global landscape. It would act as a custodian of educational integrity, providing consistent oversight, strategic guidance, and adaptability to emerging trends, such as digital transformation and the integration of 21st-century skills. Such a commission would also act as a bridge between national aspirations and global trends. By aligning the education system with international best practices, it could facilitate the integration of modern pedagogical techniques, digital tools, and skills development aligned with the demands of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Furthermore, its focus on equity could help address regional and socioeconomic disparities, ensuring that no student is left behind. In this way, a Permanent Education Commission would not only uphold the recommendations of the National Education Policy 2010 but also serve as a catalyst for the comprehensive transformation of Bangladesh’s education sector.

Tackling graft with anti-bribery steps,"CORRUPTION is a global issue that undermines trust, economic growth and social progress. Every year, trillions of dollars are lost to bribery and corruption, depriving citizens of resources that could improve lives. Anti-bribery management systems are emerging as a structured and effective solution to this pervasive problem. These systems aim to instil a culture of integrity and ensure compliance with anti-corruption legislation. But how do they work? Can they make a difference? AN ANTI-BRIBERY management system is a framework designed to prevent, detect and respond to bribery in organisations. Guided by ISO 37001, the international standard for such systems, the anti-bribery management system emphasises risk assessment, internal controls, employee training and robust reporting mechanisms. It aims at reducing vulnerabilities, fostering transparency and building trust. According to the United Nations, approximately 5 per cent of the global gross domestic product, or around $2.6 trillion, is lost to corruption annually, highlighting the urgent need for solutions. At its core, the anti-bribery management system works by identifying vulnerabilities within an organisation and addressing them through comprehensive policies and procedures. Employees and stakeholders are educated in risks and consequences of bribery while safe reporting channels are established for whistleblowers. Regular audits ensure that the system adapts to evolving challenges. For instance, companies like Siemens and Shell have implemented ISO 37001 to rebuild trust and reduce legal risks after facing bribery scandals. These systems not only protect organisations but also improve investor confidence and public perception. The benefits of anti-bribery management systems extend beyond individual organisations to national and global levels. Countries such as Singapore have integrated anti-bribery frameworks into their governance structures, transforming from corruption-prone to some of the least corrupt nations in the world. Public offices in Singapore operate under stringent anti-corruption measures, ensuring transparency in procurement, licensing and policymaking. Globally, organisations such as the World Bank and the United Nations encourage anti-bribery management system adoption to curb corruption in international trade and development projects. Various sectors have embraced anti-bribery management systems to tackle corruption effectively. In the public sector, governments use these systems to improve governance and minimise corruption in services delivery. For example, South Korea’s Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission employs systemic controls to deter bribery in public procurement processes. In the private sector, companies leverage anti-bribery management systems to meet compliance requirements and safeguard their reputation. Global corporations such as Ericsson have implemented rigorous anti-bribery measures to reduce corruption risks in supply chains. Even non-profits benefit from anti-bribery management systems by ensuring transparency in donor funding and project execution. The Red Cross, for instance, has adopted anti-bribery policies to guarantee that funds reach beneficiaries without diversion. Countries around the world are adopting anti-bribery management systems to combat corruption more effectively. The Bribery Act of the United Kingdom mandates companies to implement anti-corruption measures, including anti-bribery management systems, to avoid severe penalties. Malaysia’s ‘corporate liability’ clause requires companies to demonstrate adequate procedures to prevent bribery. In Brazil, the Clean Company Act incentivises businesses to adopt anti-bribery management systems by offering reduced penalties to those having robust anti-corruption systems put in place. Indonesia, for instance, has introduced stringent laws aimed at public sector transparency and established the Corruption Eradication Commission to investigate corruption cases. Similarly in Kenya, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission promotes anti-bribery management systems among public and private institutions to ensure adherence to ethical standards and reduce bribery in key sectors such as healthcare and education. Technology is also playing a critical role in enhancing anti-bribery management systems. Emerging tools such as blockchain, artificial intelligence and data analytics offer innovative ways to improve transparency and detect fraudulent activities. Blockchain, for example, ensures secure and tamper-proof records in procurement and contract management, reducing opportunities for bribery. Artificial intelligence-powered systems can analyse patterns to identify potential red flags in financial transactions, providing organisations with actionable insights. Such technologies are increasingly being integrated into anti-bribery management systems frameworks worldwide. Real-world success stories demonstrate the transformative impact of anti-bribery management systems. In Mexico, the implementation of anti-corruption platforms within municipal governments has significantly reduced bribery in local procurement. In Rwanda, digitising public services and introducing zero-tolerance policies towards corruption have dramatically improved the country’s global corruption ranking. The examples showcase how anti-bribery management systems, when combined with political will and public participation, can drive meaningful change. Public awareness and engagement are essential for the success of anti-bribery management systems. Citizens, civil society organisations and the media play a crucial role in advocating for transparency and holding institutions accountable. Community-driven campaigns can educate people in costs of corruption and empower them to demand ethical practices. For example, Transparency International’s advocacy initiatives have mobilised grass-roots support to push for stronger anti-corruption laws worldwide. Adopting an anti-bribery management systems requires a clear road map. Organisations must first understand the framework and secure leadership commitment to foster a culture of ethical behaviour. Risk assessments help tl identify areas susceptible to bribery while comprehensive policies and training ensure employees are well-informed. Secure reporting channels encourage whistleblowers to come forward without fear of retaliation. Regular monitoring and audits are crucial to keeping the system effective and responsive to new challenges. Although smaller organisations may face financial constraints, gradual implementation and scaling can make adoption manageable. Despite its potential, adopting anti-bribery management systems comes with challenges. Resistance to change can arise among employees who view the system as burdensome. Cultural norms in some regions may normalize bribery, making it harder to enforce such frameworks. Additionally, the cost of implementation can be prohibitive for smaller entities. However, these hurdles can be overcome through strong leadership advocacy, public awareness campaigns and phased implementation. Governments and organisations must work together to educate communities about the harmful effects of corruption and the benefits of transparency. While anti-bribery management systems are not a silver bullet, it is a powerful tool in the fight against corruption. When coupled with political will, public awareness and international cooperation, it creates a ripple effect across society. Citizens can play a vital role in encouraging accountability and supporting initiatives like anti-bribery management systems to help build a more equitable world. By embracing these systems, we can envision a future where honesty is the norm, not the exception, and take a significant step toward turning this vision into reality.

India’s manipulative diplomacy,"THE recent visit of India’s foreign secretary to Dhaka came at a time charged with transformative potential and stakes that are unrivalled. To Bangladesh, the July uprising is more than just a tectonic shift; it’s a declaration of people’s will against tyranny, it is a beacon for nations under oppression, and it is a call for unification. For India, it is a moment of truth that will say whether it can look beyond manipulative diplomacy and move in tandem with the winds of change blowing across South Asia. The decisions India took during this visit will have an impact far beyond Dhaka; it will define how the world views the region’s largest democracy as it charts a delicate Indo-Pacific and grapples with its own domestic discontent.  Manipulative diplomacy vs transparent leadership THE fact that India will allow Sheikh Hasina to make a public statement from its soil before this visit is deeply problematic. It reflects an attempt to use her voice as a veiled threat to Bangladesh’s interim government before this visit, something not befitting the world’s largest democracy; it is rather a page out of the playbook of wily authoritarian states. There are reasons why this strategy backfires: Generation resilience: The Bangladeshi youth who went out unarmed against live ammunition will not be deterred by pressure tactics. This is a generation that, still unarmed, has defied snipers and APCs; they scoff at manipulative diplomacy. Loss of trust: It only increases the lack of trust between India and the people of Bangladesh, spoiling the goodwill the relation ought to have. For India to secure its place as a good neighbour, it must abandon such antiquated policy and adopt an evenhanded, transparent policy working in harmony with the sovereignty and desires of Bangladesh.  Line in the sand INDIA needs to realise that the way it is treating Sheikh Hasina and her ousted regime at present may cause irreparable damage to its relations with the interim government, future governments, and, most importantly, the people of Bangladesh. The time for appeasement is over. It is a diplomatic and moral necessity now to arrest Sheikh Hasina immediately and put a halt on her ability to incite further violence in Bangladesh. All the members of her regime now hiding in India should be properly investigated with actionable action against the persons found guilty of crimes against humanity. Extradition proceedings against them should commence without further ado. Only this will signal that the Indian government has respect for justice and human rights. The interim government of Bangladesh is not an ordinary administration; it is a government born of the blood of the people. In the July uprising, more than 1,500 lives were lost and thousands more maimed. Among the dead were children as young as three, innocents caught in the crossfire of tyranny, irrespective of religious or political beliefs. This government is not bound by mere political promises but by an unshakeable obligation to those who gave up everything to free their nation from Sheikh Hasina’s autocracy. For India to expect the same level of manipulability it once enjoyed under Hasina is a grave miscalculation. This government is not beholden to foreign appeasement or quiet deals; it is answerable to the people who fought unarmed against a regime armed to the teeth. Only if cooperation with India is prefaced by real deeds that demonstrate India’s commitment to justice and democracy will it be viable. Arresting Hasina immediately would be a stepping stone towards that, nothing less than that.  India’s reputation on line INDIA’S support for the autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina does not happen in a vacuum but is under intense international scrutiny, mainly from Western democracies and human rights organisations. Such actions run the risk of erosion of global standing for any country that aspires to be a formidable nation in the Indo-Pacific and a beacon of democracy. Much of India’s hold in the Indo-Pacific rests on its democratic credentials, which are already in question. By continuing to support Hasina, whose rule has been marked by electoral manipulation, human rights abuses, and suppression of minorities, India sends a contradictory message. These developments are being watched very closely by Western democracies, most especially by the US, Japan, and Australia. India’s tacit approval of Hasina’s oppressive tactics could weaken its position in alliances like the Quad. The reputation of India as the ‘world’s largest democracy’ is already under question due to rising authoritarian tendencies domestically. Supporting a leader responsible for the deaths of 1,500 civilians during Bangladesh’s July uprising further erodes that perception. Human rights groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have already documented Hasina’s brutal crackdowns. India’s tacit approval not only sullies its democratic image but also bolsters accusations of complicity in these atrocities. International attention is not merely rhetorical; it has real-world consequences. Global advocacy groups can magnify this censure, shaping foreign investments and partnerships. India needs to ask itself: Can it afford to be seen as the enabler of tyranny when the soft power of its reputation rests on its model of democracy?  Adani: national security threat UNDER the Hasina regime, India allowed economic ties to get entangled with corruption and short-term gains. The Adani Group is exposed to serious allegations of running a monopoly of energy in Bangladesh with bloated prices, unfair contracts, and strategic risks. The controversial energy deals, creating monopolistic control that mirrors another East India Company. In addition, Rahul Gandhi has raised concerns about Adani’s ties to Chinese logistics firms, further compromising India’s economic and security interests. It is undeniable that, by supporting regimes like Hasina’s, India has allowed strategic vulnerabilities to fester near its borders. India’s silence on these issues raises uncomfortable questions on what it means by national security.  Why India needs to rethink narrative INDIA’S support for Sheikh Hasina, even in her exile, has taken an insidious turn with narratives targeting the minorities in Bangladesh. Such narratives, cobbled together by her supporters and amplified by sympathetic elements in India, pose a twin threat: destabilising the very fabric of Bangladesh’s society and undermining India’s own reputation as a secular democracy. Under Hasina’s leadership, Bangladesh’s minorities — Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, and indigenous communities — have faced unprecedented repression. Ironically, her exile to India has not stopped such divisive rhetoric; rather, reported targeted propaganda in India and abroad points toward a campaign of sowing discord within Bangladesh by portraying the revolution as anti-minority while masking Hasina’s track record of enabling systemic discrimination and violence. This is not a story confined to Bangladesh. In India, supporters of Hasina are using this propaganda to conflate her plight with communal agendas by falsely depicting her as a protector of the minorities and demonising the revolutionaries who toppled her tyrannical regime. In allowing such narratives to gain traction, India risks entrenching itself in a dangerous position. Here’s why such rhetoric is counterproductive for India: Undermining regional stability: Support for Hasina’s communal rhetoric is a blow to Bangladesh’s efforts to heal from the July uprising. If the communal tensions reignite, the instability will spill into India — especially in sensitive regions such as Assam, Tripura, and West Bengal, where communal fault lines already exist. Against secular values: India used to pride itself on its secular democracy; therefore, even implicitly standing by a leader known to oppress minorities tarnishes this image. Continued support for this narrative weakens India’s moral standing and further fuels criticism from international human rights organisations. Alienating future generations in Bangladesh: The Bangladeshi youths who fought for democracy and inclusivity during the July uprising now look at India with suspicion because of its apparent support for Hasina. This mistrust could sour future bilateral relations and reduce India’s influence in its neighbour’s affairs. Undermining domestic cohesion: By allowing the rhetoric of Hasina to grow unstopped, it emboldens communal elements in India. Tensions between India’s own religious communities are threatened to be ignited, undermining domestic harmony and social cohesion. India needs to take note of the larger significance of Hasina’s minority rhetoric and its potential to destabilise both countries. India should distance itself from Hasina’s propaganda machine and publicly reaffirm its support for Bangladesh’s democratic aspirations, including the protection of minorities. Counter Hasina’s false narratives with the proof of the inclusiveness of the uprising through the stories of Hindus, Muslims, Christians, and Buddhists united against tyranny and engage in fact-based diplomacy.  Defining moment for South Asia INDIA now stands at a historic juncture. Will India rise to the occasion, supporting Bangladesh’s democratic rebirth, or will it cling to alliances that undermine its values and interests? Its actions in Bangladesh are not just a test of diplomatic finesse but of its commitment to its own identity as the world’s largest democracy. The choice is stark: to stand with the democratic aspirations of Bangladesh’s people or tacitly to endorse a discredited autocracy sowing division and oppression. Sheikh Hasina’s rule represents a world, one where there has been corruption, repression, and fear. The blood-stained streets of the July Revolution call for another kind of future. Taking Sheikh Hasina into custody and pulling down her propaganda machinery would signal that India respects justice and human rights and also proves willing to be a principled regional leader. Its credibility with allies, its image as a secular democracy, and its ability to cooperate with South Asian countries all depend on its ability to shed outdated, manipulative tactics. In standing with the people of Bangladesh, in supporting their democratic rebirth, India can secure a partnership based on trust. The stakes are high. The eyes of the world are upon us. History will remember if India chose courage over convenience, justice over expediency, and unity over division. The time for half-measures has gone. Now is the time to lead with bold, unequivocal action.  Abu Rushd is president of the Institute of Strategy and Tactics Research.

Martyr Abu Sayeed’s father admitted to Dhaka CMH,"Maqbul Hossain, father of martyr Abu Sayeed, has been admitted to the Dhaka Combined Military Hospital for advanced cardiac care following a heart attack. The 74-year-old was flown to Dhaka on Tuesday night via an army helicopter, said his elder son, Ramzan Ali. He said that doctors recommended transferring Maqbul Hossain to Dhaka CMH after his condition deteriorated. Earlier, on December 7, Maqbul was admitted to Rangpur CMH with a fever and stomach pain. However, his health worsened, and he was shifted to the ICU of Rangpur Medical College Hospital on December 10 for closer monitoring. Subsequent tests confirmed he had suffered a heart attack, prompting the decision to move him to Dhaka for specialised treatment. Abu Sayed, a student of Begum Rokeya University, Rangpur, was shot dead on July 16 by the police during the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement. Assistant sub-inspector Amir Hossain and constable Sujan Chandra Roy were suspended and attached to the police lines for their alleged involvement with this killing.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252564/martyr-abu-sayeeds-father-admitted-to-dhaka-cmh
Mehidy rues batting as Tigers lose series,"After blaming the bowlers for failing to take wickets in the middle overs in the first match, Bangladesh captain Mehidy Hasan Miraz has now lamented the batting after a crushing seven-wicket loss to the West Indies in the second one-day international at Warner Park in St Kitts on Tuesday. Bangladesh entered the series with an 11-match winning streak over the Caribbean. After losing two consecutive matches, the Tigers were humbled in a series for the first time since 2014, with the West Indies taking an unassailable 2-0 lead. The visitors only managed to post 227 runs, that too with the help of a record eighth wicket partnership between Mahmudullah (62 off 92) and Tanzim Hasan (45 off 62). After losing seven wickets for just 115, the duo added 92 of 106 balls—the highest for this wicket for Bangladesh. After the match, Mehidy said that they knew that wasn’t enough. ‘Definitely, Mahmudullah and Sakib played well, but it was our mistake [with bat in hand that cost us],’ said Mehidy. Bangladesh’s innings was dented early despite Tanzid Hasan’s breezy 46 off 33. Soumya Sarker (two), Liton Das (four off 19), and Mehidy (one) all fell cheaply off Jayden Seales, and that handed the hosts an early advantage. ‘I think they bowled really well, especially Seales in the first couple of overs. We didn’t get early runs. We were 20-4; that was the problem. But even then we believed that we could come back,’ said Mehidy. Afif Hossain, batting at five, got the start but couldn’t capitalise on it as he became the first wicket for the left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie in four games. Mahmudullah, with the company of Tanzim, fought well for a period. But none of them could finish it off as Bangladesh got all out with 25 balls remaining in the innings. Mehidy thought that batting had cost them the game. ‘We didn’t bat well in the middle overs. We didn’t get any partnerships. [We lost] back-to-back wickets; that was the problem,’ he rued. On a good batting wicket, Bangladesh bowlers found it hard to break through. They got it when Evin Lewis chipped it back to Rishad Hossain on 49. But that didn’t bother King—who made 82 off 76—with the company of Keacy Carty (45 off 47) got the hosts to a comfortable position. Nahid Rana’s pacy yorker was too hot to handle for him. That, however, didn’t cost the West Indies at all, as captain Shai Hope and the hero of the first match—Sherfane Rutherford—took them home with 79 balls to spare. Mehidy praised the efforts of the bowlers but realised that wasn’t enough. ‘We bowled really well in the first 10 overs, especially our best bowler—Rana—who bowled well,’ said the Bangladesh captain. ‘[But eventually] our score wasn’t enough on this type of wicket. 300-plus was needed here. On this wicket, it’s hard for bowlers to defend a score like 220 runs.’ The third and final match of the series will be held at the same venue today.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252563/mehidy-rues-batting-as-tigers-lose-series
Ariful 94 trumps Jishan 100,"Jishan Alam took NCL T20 by storm as he smashed a 52-ball ton but was overshadowed by Ariful Islam’s 94 off 46 balls as Dhaka chased down Sylhet’s 205 in the last delivery in one of the four matches on the opening day at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday. The match went down to the wire as Dhaka needed five runs in the final delivery. Shuvagata Hom hit a low full toss off Tofael Ahmed over extra-cover for a six to clinch a thrilling win. This was only the fourth time that a team has chased down a 200-plus target in Bangladesh. After losing a wicket in the first over, Dhaka were aided by Ariful, who hit eight sixes. But till then, it was all Jishan, who hit 10 sixes — third highest by a Bangladeshi batter — in his innings. Five of those came in the 14th over off Arafat Sunny Jr. In the other match of the morning, Dhaka Metro beat Barishal by 31 runs. The two openers—Naim Sheikh (65 off 35) and Imranuzzaman (53 off 33)—laid a strong foundation for Metro, who eventually posted 192-4. That proved to be too much for Barishal, who managed 161-8 despite Fazle Mahmud’s 77 off 52 balls. In the afternoon matches, Rajshahi and Rangpur saw the better of Khulna and Chattogram, respectively. Rajshahi were 11 runs ahead in the DLS method when bad light stopped play at the Outer Ground after they scored 153-3 in 17.2 overs in reply to Khulna’s 172-7. Recently concluded U-19 Asia Cup champions Bangladesh captain Azizul Hakim top-scored with 53 off 31 for Khulna while Mrittonjoy Chowdhury played a cameo of 31 off 15. But opener Habibur Rahman’s 38-ball 66 paved the way for Rajshahi. At the Main Ground, Rangpur handed a thrashing defeat to Chattogram, who managed only 132-9 in 20 overs. Tamim Iqbal, who returned to competitive cricket after May, scored 13 off 10 before being bowled by Anamul Haque. Mukidul Islam took 3-17 while Alauddin Babu had two for just nine runs. Rangpur then got home with five wickets and 19 balls remaining thanks to Tanbir Hayder’s 41 off 37 and Naeem Islam’s 12-ball 24.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252562/ariful-94-trumps-jishan-100

ACC to launch probe against ‘big fishes’ soon: chairman,"The newly appointed chairman of Anti-Corruption Commission, Mohammad Abdul Momen, on Wednesday said that the commission would start investigation into the allegations against ‘big fishes’ soon. ‘Working as per public expectations is top priority. We will take action immediately about those cases of corruption which affected the country significantly and take action against culprits who were behind the corruption,’ he said. Momen came up with the remarks while talking to journalists at ACC headquarters in the capital’s Segun Bagicha after taking charge as chairman of the commission. Earlier on the day, the Transparency International Bangladesh, in a statement, urged the new ACC chairman and commissioners to voluntarily disclose their income and asset statements to ensure accountability and transparency. In this regard, the ACC chief said that the commission’s chairman and commissioners would submit information on all their movable and immovable assets within seven days. Momen also told journalists that the new commission will not be influenced by any political ideology or bias. ‘We will be neutral, adhering to the law,’ he added. About his priority works, he said, ‘We will start working first on the issues expected by the people and the big corruptions that affected the state.’ ‘So that those who were involved in all this big corruption do not get a release,’ he added. When asked about a graft allegation against Momen while he was posted at Biman Bangladesh Airlines, he said it was true that a graft allegation came to ACC against me in 2009 but I was cleared of the charges after completion of probe in 2023. Abdul Momen and another commissioner Mia Mohammad Ali Akbar Azizi joined ACC on Wednesday but another commissioner Brigadier General (retd) Hafiz Ahsan Farid did not join on the day. TIB, in a media statement on Wednesday, emphasised the importance of maintaining public trust in this key institution and called for proactive measures to promote integrity. TIB executive director Iftekharuzzaman said that at this crucial moment, the leadership of the ACC should take the initiative to promote transparency and accountability within the institution. He urged the ACC’s top officials to disclose details regarding their income and assets, either in their own name or family members’ names, whether declared or undeclared. The TIB also called for the disclosure of data demonstrating consistency between income from legitimate sources and accumulated wealth. TIB suggested for full disclosure of any direct or indirect political affiliations and a formal declaration of readiness to voluntarily resign and undergo legal investigation in case of any discrepancies in their asset declarations. The government on Tuesday appointed senior secretary of the Public Security Division of home ministry Mohammad Abdul Momen as ACC chairman and other two commissioners.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252560/acc-to-launch-probe-against-big-fishes-soon-chairman
Police must reach scene of incident in an hour: DMP commissioner,"Dhaka Metropolitan police commissioner Sheikh Md Sajjad Ali has instructed police officers to act promptly on any complaints or general diaries filed at police stations, emphasising the importance of swift responses in building public trust. Speaking at the monthly crime review meeting for November 2024, held at the Bangladesh Police Auditorium in Dhaka’s Rajarbagh on Wednesday, the DMP commissioner said, ‘The police must reach the scene of an incident within an hour and conduct initial investigations. If necessary, a case must be filed. Quick action in any incident will foster a positive perception of the police among the public.’ Highlighting the challenges faced by Dhaka city, home to nearly two crore residents, the DMP commissioner noted the city’s issues, such as traffic congestion and other complications. ‘To restore our lost glory, Dhaka Metropolitan Police and Bangladesh Police have undertaken initiatives, including engaging directly with the public, listening to their concerns, and assuring them of our commitment to providing top-notch service,’ he said. The DMP commissioner encouraged police officers to set examples through their behavior, ethics, and lifestyle, saying, ‘As the DMP commissioner, I aspire to elevate this institution to new heights. I urge my colleagues to also serve as role models. Public perception of police officers is as important as the fulfillment of their legal responsibilities.’ The commissioner emphasised that one of the police’s primary duties is to apprehend criminals and ensure justice through the courts. He issued a stern warning against misclassifying homicides as unnatural deaths in police records. ‘Such misreporting will lead to severe punitive action, and the respective officer-in-charge of the station will be held accountable,’ he added. He also called for strict action against muggers, extortionists and teen gangs. To combat these crimes, he proposed the formation of citizen forums comprising teachers, students, workers, community leaders, and businesspeople to promote collaboration and prevention. During the meeting, joint commissioner, crime, Md Faruq Hossain presented a detailed analysis of November’s crime statistics, covering offenses such as robbery, burglary, murder, accidental deaths, road accidents, gender-based violence, drug trafficking, and arms recovery. The DMP commissioner provided various directives aimed at tackling these issues effectively.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252559/police-must-reach-scene-of-incident-in-an-hour-dmp-commissioner
FIFA to confirm Saudi Arabia as 2034 World Cup hosts,"FIFA is set to confirm on Wednesday that Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup while a joint bid by Morocco, Spain and Portugal which also features matches in South America will be awarded the 2030 tournament. The awarding of hosting rights for both tournaments will go to a vote during a FIFA Congress to be held virtually, but there is no doubt about the outcomes with neither bid having a rival. As for 2034, FIFA invoked its principle of rotating its flagship tournament between continents, only welcoming bids from Asia or Oceania -- the 2026 World Cup, the first involving 48 teams, will take place across North America. Controversially, the body gave potential bidders barely a month last year to submit candidacies, and Australia and Indonesia quickly abandoned their interest. That left Saudi Arabia as the sole candidate, clearing the way for the World Cup to return to the Gulf region so soon after Qatar hosted in 2022. The kingdom's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been using sport for some time to amass influence and improve its global image -- critics though say he is effectively ‘sportswashing’ by diverting attention from Saudi Arabia's rights record. Saudi Arabia already hosts several high-profile events including a Formula One Grand Prix, heavyweight boxing contests, the LIV rival golf circuit funded by Saudi's sovereign wealth fund,  and the WTA Finals tennis. Being handed the 2034 World Cup will be a crowning moment, and Saudi will secure hosting rights despite currently only boasting two stadiums with a capacity of 40,000, when 14 are required. Beyond that logistical challenge, the baking temperatures in the northern hemisphere summer could mean pushing the tournament back to later in the year, as happened in Qatar in 2022. However, the fact that Ramadan will take place in December that year is an added complication. Moreover, the awarding of the World Cup to Saudi will make the issue of human rights a major talking point again, just as two years ago. Rights groups highlight mass executions in Saudi Arabia and allegations of torture, as well as restrictions on women under the conservative country's male guardianship system. Free expression is severely restricted too. The 2030 tournament will mark a century since the first World Cup was held in Uruguay, and as a result the bid will also see the South American nation handed a game along with Argentina and Paraguay. That makes it a completely unprecedented bid, involving three different continental confederations. FIFA confirmed over a year ago that the joint proposal led by Morocco, Spain and Portugal was the sole contender for 2030, with all other potential candidacies having fallen by the wayside. A joint British and Irish bid was abandoned when they decided to focus on hosting Euro 2028, while there were suggestions of a bid from South Korea, China, Japan and North Korea. Four South American countries launched a joint bid in 2019, convinced that the centenary World Cup should entirely take place on the same continent where it all began. In late 2022, UEFA promoted a bid uniting Spain and Portugal with war-torn Ukraine in a show of ‘solidarity’ following the Russian invasion. However, Ukraine was quietly dropped from that candidacy last year as Morocco joined forces with the Iberian neighbours, while South America agreed to step aside in exchange for being awarded the hosting of three games, one each for Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina. Following these ‘centenary celebrations’ in the comparative chill of the southern hemisphere winter, the six teams involved -- along with their fans -- will have to cross the Atlantic Ocean to play the rest of the tournament. This tentacular tournament will conclude with the final on July 21, and it remains to be seen where that game will be staged. Spain, which hosted the 1982 World Cup, is set to be the centrepiece as it boasts 11 of the 20 proposed stadiums. Morocco -- which has tried and failed on five previous occasions to be awarded the staging of the tournament -- will become the second African nation to host the competition after South Africa in 2010. Potential venues for the final include the Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid and Barcelona's Camp Nou, which is nearing the end of a substantial renovation project, as well as the planned Hassan II stadium between Casablanca and Rabat, which is set to become ‘the biggest stadium in the world’ with a capacity of 115,000. Portugal, which hosted Euro 2004, will offer two stadiums in Lisbon and one in Porto, and hopes to stage a semi-final.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/252558/fifa-to-confirm-saudi-arabia-as-2034-world-cup-hosts

Professor Yunus stresses expansion of technology in CHT,"Bangladesh interim government chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has laid emphasis on the expansion of technology in the Chittagong Hill Tracts to bridge the gap in communication. ‘The hilly areas are inaccessible, hence communication is difficult. That’s why there is a need for technology to expand. This distance can be overcome with technology,’ he said while virtually addressing a training programme titled ‘Hilly Zilla Parishad Management’ at the CHT Complex in Dhaka on Wednesday. The chief adviser said the hill districts which were enriched with natural beauty and resources could be the best development zone but it is lagging behind others. ‘You (CHT people) were supposed to move forward with their crops, fruits, and traditional products,’ he said. Recalling memories of women footballers came from the CHT and their struggles in clinching a trophy recently, Yunus said, ‘Your daughters have won the world in football. The youths should not only be citizens of Bangladesh, they should be citizens of the world. It will not be left behind as a remote area. There will be limitations, but the limits of mind have to be expanded. You have to reach out to people all over the world with your credit.’ He invited youths from the CHT to attend the youth festival scheduled to be held in January next and urged their parents to encourage their children to participate in the festival.

Japan organisers say 2026 Asian Games on track after reports,"Preparations for the 2026 Asian Games in Japan are going ‘smoothly’, its chairman said Wednesday, after reports the governing body told organisers to make significant improvements. Japanese media said the Olympic Council of Asia is not happy with preparations for the event in Nagoya and the wider Aichi Prefecture area and has accused organisers of not sticking to the host city contract. Aichi governor Hideaki Omura, who also serves as chairman of the local organising committee, told reporters that preparations were on schedule. ‘We are taking this in a calm manner and my understanding is that preparations are progressing smoothly,’ he said. Reports said the OCA has demanded improvements in several areas, including accommodation and transport for athletes and teams. As many as 15,000 athletes could compete at the September 19 to October 4 Games -- even more than the Olympics. The OCA has reportedly asked organisers to think again about their accommodation plans, which are said to involve housing athletes in container units and on a cruise ship. ‘We received opinions on the progress at a coordinating committee in September. We are preparing based on this,’ an organising committee spokesman told AFP. The spokesman added that they have discussions with the OCA on ‘a daily basis’. AFP has approached the OCA for comment. The previous Asian Games were held in the Chinese city of Hangzhou in 2023, one year later than planned because of the pandemic.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/others/252555/japan-organisers-say-2026-asian-games-on-track-after-reports
Afghan refugees minister killed by suicide blast,"The Afghan minister for refugees was killed on Wednesday in a suicide bombing at the ministry’s offices in the capital Kabul, government sources said, blaming the Islamic State group for the attack which has not been claimed. Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid deplored ‘a cowardly attack’ carried out by the Islamic State group, saluting a ‘great fighter’ who ‘fell as a martyr’. The explosion, which was the first attack targeting a minister since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, ‘happened at the ministry for refugees and minister Khalil Ur-Rahman Haqqani has been martyred along with some of his colleagues,’ a government source said. He added that the explosion was caused by a suicide blast. The roads leading to the ministry were blocked by Taliban authorities, with security personnel posted on surrounding rooftops. The ministry’s account on X said training workshops were held in recent days on its premises. The ministry’s corridors are full daily of numerous displaced people coming to request assistance or to follow up on resettlement cases in a country that still has more than three million war-displaced. Khalil Ur-Rahman Haqqani — who never appeared without an automatic weapon in his hand — was the brother of Jalaluddin Haqqani, founder of the feared Haqqani network responsible for some of the most violent attacks during the Taliban’s two-decade insurgency. He was also the uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the current interior minister. Khalil Ur-Rahman’s nephew, Anas Haqqani, praised his uncle, saying he ‘reached the highest level of martyrdom’, and condemned his killing by ‘those who apparently claim to follow the blessed religion of Islam’, in a post on X. The Haqqanis are said to be engaged in a struggle for influence within the Taliban authorities. According to press reports, they are pitted as a pragmatic faction up against supporters of the severe interpretation of Islamic law in line with the Taliban’s supreme leader based in Kandahar. Khalil Ur-Rahman Haqqani, who was 58, had been on US and UN sanctions lists, with Washington offering $5 million for information on him. Several senior Taliban leaders have been killed since their return to power, including provincial governors, commanders and religious clerics, mostly in attacks claimed by IS. Violence has waned in Afghanistan since the Taliban forces took over the country in 2021, ending their war against US-led NATO coalition forces. However, the regional chapter of IS, known as Islamic State Khorasan, is active in Afghanistan and has regularly targeted civilians, foreigners and Taliban officials with gun and bomb attacks. In Kabul, explosions regularly echo through the city, but while local sources report them, they are rarely confirmed by Taliban authorities. At the end of October, a child was killed and about 10 people were wounded in a bomb attack on a downtown market. In November, IS claimed responsibility for a gun attack that left 10 people dead at a Sufi shrine in northern Baghlan province. The Taliban authorities frequently announce the arrest or killing of jihadist group members — even as they continue to claim that the IS threat has been eradicated in the country.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/252554/afghan-refugees-minister-killed-by-suicide-blast

Ancelotti hoping for top eight push after Atalanta win,"Carlo Ancelotti hopes that Real Madrid's win over Atalanta will help his team push for a top eight finish in the Champions League and direct passage for the last 16. Reigning European champions Madrid came through a tough battle in Bergamo to beat Serie A leaders Atalanta 3-2 with goals from Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham and get their title defence back on track. Madrid are now three points from the top eight positions with matches against Salzburg and Brest remaining in their league phase campaign and the rest of this week's fixtures coming up on Wednesday. ‘I don't know if we can get into top eight, but the goal is obvious, we need to win both the matches that we have left,’ Ancelotti told reporters. ‘This win will give us a lot, it's a great win because it was based on quality play and hard work. It's given us some breathing room... Let's hope we have more players available (in January), but we're more relaxed about it after today, absolutely.’ Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini was so proud of his team's performance he wasn't even too upset by Mateo Retegui blazing over a golden chance to equalise in added time. Italy forward Retegui somehow missed the target from inches out when making contact with Ademola Lookman's fizzing low cross and looked ashen faced once he realise the opportunity he had passed up. Defeat dropped Atalanta, who scored through Lookman and Charles De Ketelaere, down to ninth on 11 points with matches against Sturm Graz and Barcelona completing their league phase. ‘It happened so fast... a draw would have possibly better reflected the balance of play but maybe, losing like we did will hurt us more and force us to improve,’ said Gasperini. ‘The defeat had nothing to do with luck or anything like that and that means that we still need to tweak a few things to get to their level.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/252550/ancelotti-hoping-for-top-eight-push-after-atalanta-win
"Salah keeps Liverpool perfect, Real down Atalanta","Mohamed Salah helped maintain Liverpool's perfect record in the Champions League on Tuesday while holders Real Madrid bounced back from their defeat at Anfield to topple in-form Italians Atalanta. Elsewhere, struggling Paris Saint-Germain gained a vital win at Salzburg, while Bayer Leverkusen edged Inter Milan to move second. Aston Villa, in their first appearance in the continent's elite club competition for 41 years, maintained their bright progress beating Leipzig 3-2 to sit third. The first eight teams qualify directly for the last 16 with those placed ninth to 24 entering a play-off round. In Spain, Salah's 63rd-minute penalty proved decisive against dogged debutants Girona to extend the Premier League leaders' record to six from six in the revamped format of Europe's flagship club competition. Under new coach Arne Slot Liverpool are virtually assured a place in the last 16. ‘If you ask me about all six games, I'm really pleased with all the results... (but) I'm far from pleased about the performance tonight,’ Slot told reporters in Girona. ‘(We had) hardly any control at all over the game, maybe the second half was a bit better but then I'm trying to be positive.’ Salah sent Paulo Gazzaniga the wrong way to net his 50th Champions League goal, pulling the Egyptian level with Filippo Inzaghi as the 10th highest goalscorer of all-time in the competition. The winger is out of contract at the end of the season but his 16 goals across all competitions have been essential in Liverpool's superb first half of the season. While Liverpool are sitting pretty with two league phase rounds to come early next year, kings of Europe Real Madrid, beaten 2-0 by Liverpool last time out, have work to do to ensure their progress into the knockout phase. Kylian Mbappe gave Real a 10th minute lead before hobbling off injured in Atalanta, his strike was cancelled out by Charles de Ketelaere's penalty in first-half additional time. Real coach Carlo Ancelotti started Vinicius Junior for the first time since a hamstring problem last month. The Brazilian had Real back on top before the hour, with Jude Bellingham also on the scoresheet for a 3-2 win over the Serie a leaders. The hard-fought victory moved Real up to 18th on nine points and will have helped to settle any nerves at the 15-time European champions ahead of games against Salzburg and Brest in January. PSG put the wheels back on their stuttering campaign with a much needed 3-0 defeat on the road at Salzburg. The French champions went into this encounter in 25th with just four points and three goals scored after five matches. They approach their last two league outings in provisional 24th - the final berth for the play-offs ahead of Wednesday's games. Bayern swept aside Ukraine side Shakhtar Donetsk in Gelsenkirchen 5-1. Fellow Bundesliga giants Leverkusen became the first team to score against Inter in this year's competition in a 1-0 win that lifted them five points adrift of Liverpool at the top of the league. Another noteworthy performance on matchday six came on the Brittany coast where modest French Ligue 1 outfit Brest dished out a 1-0 defeat to former European champions PSV Eindhoven. It left the Atlantic port city club flying high in fifth in their first ever appearance at European football's high table. In other games, Celtic and Dinamo Zagreb remained in contention for the knockout round after an uninspiring 0-0 draw and Club Brugge beat Sporting 2-1. Headline matches on Wednesday include Manchester city at Juventus, and Barcelona at Borussia Dortmund.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/252549/salah-keeps-liverpool-perfect-real-down-atalanta-

"Japan pledges to continue investment, supporting Bangladesh","Japanese ambassador to Bangladesh Iwama Kiminori said on Wednesday that Japanese investors would continue to stay in Bangladesh to help boost economic development in the country. The outgoing Japanese envoy made the comments during a farewell call on chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus at the State Guest House Jamuna in Dhaka. Kiminori praised the leadership of Yunus and added that his government would cement ties with Bangladesh in three pillars of Japanese engagements, which include peace and stability, economic cooperation, and human-to-human interactions. ‘We will do our best to support the three pillars,’ Kiminori said, reiterating Tokyo’s ‘strong support’ for the reform initiatives undertaken by the interim government in areas including elections. Yunus thanked the outgoing ambassador for his contribution to the Bangladesh-Japan relationship. ‘The relationship has always been very strong,’ he said. Yunus urged for more Japanese investment in Bangladesh as his government was carrying out vital reforms to attract more foreign direct investment in the country. ‘The presence of Japanese investors in Bangladesh sends a good message for us,’ the chief adviser added. ‘Not a single Japanese company has withdrawn’ from Bangladesh after the July-August mass uprising, said the Japanese envoy and added that they were willing to stay in the country. He extended an invitation from Nikkei to an annual conference in Japan where the Japanese prime minister is expected to speak. He said that the chief adviser could meet chief executives of top Japanese companies during the meet and invite them to invest in Bangladesh. The Japanese ambassador also appreciated the chief adviser’s move to hold an international conference on the Rohingya issues, saying Tokyo strongly supports the meeting. Yunus reiterated his call to create a UN-guaranteed safe zone in Myanmar’s western Rakhine state where the displaced communities can temporarily be relocated before they return to their homes once the conflict is over.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/252546/japan-pledges-to-continue-investment-supporting-bangladesh

Toby hopes India to respect Bangladesh’s call to extradite Hasina,"Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal special prosecutor adviser Toby Cadman on Wednesday expressed optimism that India would respect Dhaka’s lawful and justified request for the extradition of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Addressing journalists after a meeting with ICT members, Toby said, ‘We would call upon India, as a democratic state, to respect the rule of law and to honour a lawful and proper extradition request if and when it is made.’ The meeting was Toby’s first official engagement with ICT chief prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam, the prosecution team and the investigation agency since his appointment as special adviser on November 21. About the prospect of Hasina’s extradition, Toby pinned hope on the extradition treaty between Bangladesh and India. However, he stressed the importance of formally framing charges before initiating such a request.’ If an extradition request is made and refused, we may need to consider trying her in absentia,’ he stated. Toby added that Bangladesh might seek assistance from the International Criminal Court, if necessary. Addressing international concerns about death penalty, he emphasised Bangladesh’s unique circumstance and urged other nations to recognise it. Ultimately, the decision to impose capital punishment would lie with the courts, he said. Toby appealed to the people of Bangladesh to remain calm and allow the prosecution and investigators to carry out their work effectively, describing the cases as ‘complex and significant.’ He underscored the need for a credible, transparent, and robust legal process to uphold the rule of law. Regarding recent amendments to the ICT Act of 1973, expanding its jurisdiction, Toby termed them ‘commendable steps’ toward aligning the tribunal with international standards. However, he stressed the necessity for further essential amendments to ensure fair trials. Toby’s remarks come in the aftermath of the Hasina government’s collapse on August 5, triggered by mass protests and upsurge. Invited by the interim government, Toby earlier arrived in Dhaka and met Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus on September 2. Notably, Toby had previously been denied entry to Bangladesh in 2009 by the Awami League government when he sought to defend suspects accused of 1971 war crimes. Currently, Toby serves as the joint head of the London-based law firm Guernica 37 Chambers, which specialises in international criminal law.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252543/toby-hopes-india-to-respect-bangladeshs-call-to-extradite-hasina
Bangladesh seeks Chinese investment in tourism sectors,"Bangladesh on Tuesday called on China to invest in its rapidly growing tourism sector at the China-Bangladesh Tourism Promotion Conference held on December 10, 2024, at the Bangladesh National Museum in Dhaka. Organised by the Embassy of China in collaboration with the Association of Travel Agents of Bangladesh and the Bangladesh National Museum, the event underscored the potential for strengthening tourism cooperation and fostering cultural and economic ties between the two nations.

72pc accounts spreading misinformation against Bangladesh located in India: Rumor Scanner,"Bangladeshi fact-checking initiative Rumor Scanner has found that about 72 per cent of social media accounts spreading fake and misinformation against Bangladesh are located in India. The fact checking body today released a report titled ‘India’s disinformation flood on Bangladesh: What’s actually happening?', showing how Indian media, alongside social media, are regularly spreading false information about the Professor Muhammad Yunus-led interim government after the fall of the Awami League government on August 5 in 2024. The report said, ‘In the wake of the student-led mass uprising in Bangladesh in August of this year, the Awami League government led by Sheikh Hasina fell. Before the current interim government led by Dr Muhammad Yunus took office on August 8, political attacks increased due to the stagnation of the administration and law enforcement agencies. At that time minorities were also affected’. However, the Rumor Scanner found through its investigations that while many attacks occurred against those with Hindu religious identities due to their political affiliations or grievances, numerous incidents were falsely propagated as communal attacks. X accounts operated from India and several Indian media outlets played a significant role in spreading these propagandas, it said Between August 5 and 13, Rumor Scanner’s investigation unit identified 50 accounts on the microblogging site X (formerly twitter) that had disseminated various images, videos, and information related to the August events in Bangladesh, presenting them in a communal light. Rumor Scanner found evidence of the propagation of communal misinformation and false information in at least one post from each of these accounts as these posts, disseminated between August 5 and 13, were viewed over 15.4 million times. The fact checking body estimates that these misinformations reached 10 to 12 times the number of people at that time on multiple other accounts and media. The investigation unit has found: ‘72% of the accounts spreading fake and misinformation are located in India. Among the account holders, there are many responsible individuals. Even several mainstream media outlets in India have propagated this false information. This disinformation flood was so powerful that it was not confined to India; even well-known public figures from different countries have promoted these claims”. The spread of communal misinformation between India and Bangladesh is not new. However, fighting against such a large volume of disinformation in such a short time in August was quite challenging for Rumor Scanner. ‘We worked tirelessly day and night. During this time, false information on various sensitive issues in Bangladesh has also spread beyond social media and reached the Indian media,’ it said. For instance, several Indian media outlets claimed in August that bans on several banned extremist organizations had been lifted in Bangladesh. Rumor Scanner verified and found this claim to be false. Days passed, and while the intensity of the misinformation decreased, it didn’t entirely stop. Over the next few months, the same accounts, as well as many others, continued to spread misinformation related to Bangladesh. Communal misinformation was particularly noticeable. Rumor Scanner noted that, ‘Every year, around the time of Durga Puja, the biggest religious festival for Hindus, there is an increase in communal propaganda, misinformation, false information, and above all, rumors. This year was no exception’. The fact checking body’s team has verified two such claims (1, 2) from Indian X accounts, which have been viewed at least 550,000 times. After this issue, Indian media, alongside social media, regularly spread false information about the interim government. ‘False claims such as Dr Yunus’s physical illness or Dr Yunus fleeing to France after Trump’s victory were widely propagated by the Indian media. Additionally, a false claim circulated on social media, where a man named Abdullah Al Mahfuz, who was arrested in 2019 as a Hizbut Tahrir leader in Chattogram, was falsely claimed to be Adviser Mahfuj. Rumor Scanner confirmed that the two individuals are different,’ the report said. ‘On November 10, when the Awami League announced the commemoration of Shaheed Noor Hossain Day, a claim went viral on numerous X accounts stating that a Hindu woman was raped while participating in this programme. This explosive claim, shared in posts reaching nearly 800,000 people, was proven false by Rumor Scanner,’ it added. Additionally, in November, an Indian television channel named ‘Republic Bangla’ falsely claimed that a Pakistani ship carrying weapons and ammunition had arrived at the Chittagong port, the investigation team found. The report said a new wave of significant disinformation, primarily driven by Indians, began again in late November. ‘On November 25, the Detective Branch of Bangladesh Police arrested Chinmoy Krishna Das, the spokesperson of the Bangladesh United Hindu Awakening Joint Front, on charges of sedition for allegedly desecrating the national flag in Dhaka. The following day, when he was produced before a court in Chattogram, his bail plea was rejected. This led to tension in the court premises, resulting in a clash where a lawyer named Saiful Islam was stabbed to death’. ‘Indian media and X accounts have been very active in reporting on this issue. Mainstream Indian media and X accounts are running a misinformation campaign on this issue. Notably, the X accounts identified by Rumor Scanner in August are leading this new wave of disinformation on X. This is quite alarming. Their posts are spreading like wildfire on the internet, given their large number of followers,’the investigation report said. Following the fall of the Awami League regime on August 5, a coordinated disinformation campaign emerged, primarily driven by Hindutva accounts spreading fake news and communal propaganda against Bangladesh, it said. ‘A distinct pattern could be observed in their approach which involving Communalizing Incidents Involving Hindu Victims, framing political violence as communal attacks, sharing videos of Muslim victims or property as those of Hindus, attempting to portray the July-August Uprising as a militant or Islamist takeover with a narrative of rising extremism, and making unsubstantiated claims of mass rape and murder of minority communities,’ the Rumor Scanner found. It is like whenever a Hindu individual was involved in an incident as a victim, it was deliberately framed with a communal angle, even if the event stemmed from political disputes, personal conflicts, or other non-religious motives. In particular, after the fall of the Awami League government led by Sheikh Hasina, the party’s leaders and activists were attacked due to political and public anger. Many of these incidents have been propagated in communal form on social media. ‘Notably, such narratives were not limited to Indian social media accounts; the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC) also contributed to this framing. Their reports, often exaggerated or misleading, became sources for various local and international media outlets,’ the fact checking body said. In a report published last September, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council cited nine communal killings. However, investigative findings, including a detailed report by Netra News, debunked these claims. The investigations revealed that none of the deaths were linked to religious or sectarian motives. Instead, seven cases were attributed to political retaliation, mob violence, or criminal disputes. An analysis of fact-checks published on the Rumor Scanner website shows that the organisation identified 59 pieces of misinformation during the August disinformation flood. While this number decreased in the following two months (four in September and seven in October), it surged again in November. Rumor Scanner identified 31 pieces of misinformation in November. A total of 120 pieces of misinformation have been detected during this period, including 19 as of the 10 of this month (December) as Indian media has been involved in spreading these false narratives. Rumor Scanner has published a list of 49 media outlets that have spread 13 false news items about Bangladesh between August 12 and December 5. Besides media outlets, influential individuals from various countries, including India, have also contributed to spreading this misinformation, the report said. This list includes at least two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) politicians (Suvendu Adhikari, Agnimitra Pal), former Pakistani cricketer Danish Kaneria, Salwan Momika who was accused of multiple Quran burnings in Sweden, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin who has long been under the protection of the Indian government, and Nupur Sharma, editor of the Indian media outlet OpIndia. Rumor Scanner’s analysis shows that the misinformation spread about Bangladesh on X after August has been viewed at least 200 million times as one of these posts has been viewed more than 10 million times. This misinformation has spread beyond social media platforms, appearing in television and print media. As a result, countless people have been exposed to false information about Bangladesh. While it is true that some unfortunate incidents of communal violence have occurred in Bangladesh, the real scenario is not as it has been portrayed, the Rumor Scanner said in its report. ‘The exaggerated narrative of Hindu persecution creates a distorted and overly negative scenario of Bangladesh minority conditions. This could potentially create tensions between the people of Bangladesh and India. It could also pose a threat to the security of both countries,’ it said. The Rumor Scanner also feared that the flow of misinformation will increase in the coming days.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252540/72pc-accounts-spreading-misinformation-against-bangladesh-located-in-india-rumor-scanner
Dhaka becomes 3rd most polluted city with AQI score of 249,"Dhaka ranked third on the list of cities worldwide with the worst air quality with an AQI score of 249 at 9:10am on Wednesday morning. Dhaka’s air was classified as ‘very unhealthy’, according to the air quality and pollution city ranking. Pakistan’s Lahore and India’s Kolkata occupied the first and second spots in the list, with AQI scores of 320 and 285, respectively. An AQI between 151 and 200 is considered ‘unhealthy’ while 201-300 is ‘very unhealthy’ and 301-400 is considered ‘hazardous’, posing severe health risks to residents. The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. The AQI in Bangladesh is based on five pollutants — particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues.

BNP wings’ march vows to protect sovereignty,"The long March by the associate bodies of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party towards India’s Agartala from Dhaka protesting at the attack on the Bangladesh mission in Agartala ended at the Akhaura land port in a rally on Wednesday. The concluding rally, jointly organised by BNP’s three associate bodies— Jatiyatabadi Juba Dal, Swechchhasebak Dal, and Chhatra Dal—was held in the afternoon on the day just about 250 metres away from the Bangladesh-India Operation Zero Line. Speakers at the event slammed the attack on Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala state and desecration of Bangladesh’s national flag. Both the Indian and Bangladesh authorities tightened security measures over the long march with a huge number of Border Guard Bangladesh and police personnel in uniform and plainclothes deployed in the border areas to prevent any untoward situation, according to New Age correspondent in Brahmanbaria and the Indian media. Retired police officials, meanwhile, brought out a protest procession and held a rally in front of the National Press Club in the capital on the day, protesting at India’s dominance and aggression in Bangladesh. Leaders and activists of BNP’s associated bodies in many places, including Dhaka, Chattogram, Sylhet, Narsingdi and Narayanganj, joined the long march with over 2,000 microbuses and private cars. After holding a short rally in front of the BNP’s central office in the capital’s Naya Paltan, the march began at about 9:10am and reached Akhaura land port via Motijheel, Mayor Hanif Flyover, Chittagong Road, Kanchpur, Tarabo, Madhabdi, Pachdona, Bholanagar, Marjal, Baroicha and Bhairab. ‘I strongly condemn the attack on Bangladesh mission in Agartala as the Indian authority failed to provide security,’ Juba Dal president Abdul Monayem Munna said, addressing the rally as chief guest at Akhaura land port. He said that the country’s people would not compromise under the leadership of BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman in the question of national sovereignty. He also condemned the Indian government saying that it had patronised fascist Sheikh Hasina in the past over 15 years and the same government was also hatching a conspiracy against Bangladesh. Protests spread in Dhaka as elsewhere across the country hours after the Bangladesh mission in Agartala came under attack by a group of Indians on December 2 during their protests, demanding the release of Hindu community leader in Bangladesh Chinmoy Krishna Das, now in jail in a sedition case. The BNP bodies also held a rally at Bhairab before going to Akhaura land port while leaders and activists joined the long march in throughout the journey. Addressing a short rally as the chief guest while inaugurating the long march in Dhaka, BNP senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvy said that India was trying to sustain the ‘lady vampire’, apparently speaking about the ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina. ‘We have bought the independence with blood sacrifice. We will not surrender our independence to India,’ he said. He said that although India was a democratic country, it did not want democracy in Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka. ‘Delhi wants to control the neighbouring countries,’ he added.  The traffic around Nayapaltan remained halted for about two hours since 7:45am due to presence of several thousand leaders and activists of the party’s associate bodies. BNP associate bodies started gathering at Naya Paltan with small processions since 7:00am. Chairing the rally, Chhatra Dal president Rakibul Islam Rakib said that India kept continuing its conspiracies after Sheikh Hasina fled there on August 5 driven by a student-led mass uprising. Juba Dal general secretary Nurul Islam Noyon said that his organisation was ready to resist India’s conspiracy. Speakers also slammed Indian media outlets for spreading rumours about Bangladesh. At the rally organised by the Bangladesh Retired Police Officers’ Welfare Association, speakers said that India supported the fascist Awami League regime to take economic and political advantages and stood against the people of Bangladesh by providing shelter to fallen Hasina. Retired inspector general of police AKM Shahidul Haque said that Indian dominance and aggression would not be tolerated. ‘We know how to fight for independence and sovereignty,’ said Shahidul. The organisation’s acting president and retired deputy inspector general of police M Akbar Ali said that the people of Bangladesh had not fought in the War of Independence to serve Indian interests. The protest procession began in front of the Rajarbagh Police Lines marched to the National Press Club parading through Shantinagar, Kakrail and Segunbagicha. The programme concluded with handing over a memorandum to the foreign ministry. Besides, Jatiya Ganotantrik Party also organised a protest rally in front of the National Press Club slamming India’s malicious activities against Bangladesh.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/252538/bnp-wings-march-vows-to-protect-sovereignty
Prosecutor fights Trump bid to throw out hush money conviction,"Manhattan prosecutors renewed their opposition Tuesday to President-elect Donald Trump’s efforts to quash his hush money conviction, but accepted pausing the case while he is president. Trump has long opposed the criminal process against him brought after he paid a porn star for her silence and then covered up the payments in an effort to boost his chances in 2016’s election. Juan Merchan, the judge in the only criminal case against Trump that has gone to trial, indefinitely postponed Trump’s sentencing at a hearing on November 22, given his win in the November 5 presidential election. The court ‘should reject the defendant’s motion to “immediately” dismiss the indictment and vacate the jury’s guilty verdict based on the outcome of the recent presidential election,’ prosecutor Alvin Bragg said in a court filing. Trump’s legal team had earlier cited a landmark July ruling from the Supreme Court that gives presidents sweeping immunity for official acts committed while in office as justification for their request to throw out this conviction. But prosecutors accepted Trump should receive special treatment to prevent the case interfering with his second White House stint. ‘Multiple accommodations well short of dismissal... would satisfy that objective, including a stay of proceedings during his term in office,’ the filing said. Prosecutors argued that Trump’s bid to have the case thrown out was ‘well beyond’ what was needed to protect the presidency. Merchan will now have to decide whether to throw out the case entirely, or to suspend any legal consequences until after the end of Trump’s upcoming term in office, which will begin on January 20. Bragg had argued during the hush money trial that Trump’s payments were made to cover up a scandal that would have hurt his 2016 campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton, whom he ultimately beat. Trump has consistently denied having an affair with porn star Stormy Daniels.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/north-america/252537/prosecutor-fights-trump-bid-to-throw-out-hush-money-conviction

Ctg court puts 12 on remand,"A Chattogram court on Tuesday placed 12 persons on remand in connection with two separate incidents, an attack on law enforcers and the murder of lawyer Saiful Islam Alif. Judge Alamgir Hossain of the Chattogram Metropolitan Magistrate Court 3 granted five-day remand for eight people accused of attacking members of law enforcement agencies during the transfer of Sammalita Sanatani Jagran Jote spokesperson Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari to jail, said Md Raihanul Wazed, assistant public prosecutor of the court. Those placed on remand are Sujan Chandra Das, Emon Chakraborty, Sourav Das, Sakibul Alam, Rupon Das, Sumon Das, Ahmed Hossain, and Md Rakib. Additional deputy commissioner of Chattogram Metropolitan Police Mofizur Rahman said, ‘On November 26, three cases were filed by police in connection with the attack on law enforcers and vandalism of vehicles on court premises. In one of these cases, the investigation officer sought seven-day remand for the eight accused. The court, however, granted five-day remand.’ In a separate case, the same court put four other people on remand in connection with the murder of lawyer Saiful Islam Alif near the court premises. Judge Alamgir Hossain, issued the remand order after a hearing on Tuesday evening, said Md Raihanul Wazed, assistant public prosecutor of the Metropolitan Magistrate Court. Those placed on remand are Ripon Das, Bishal Das, Aman Das, and Rajib Bhattacharya. Of them, Ripon Das has been remanded for five days, while the others have been remanded for four days each. The name of Ripon Das was not mentioned in the initial complaint but was revealed during the investigation, Raihanul said. Earlier, the suspects were brought to court from jail under heightened police security. Additional police personnel were stationed at the court’s entrance to prevent any untoward incident. On December 6, Chattogram Sixth Metropolitan Magistrate Kazi Shariful Islam put Chandan Das, the prime accused in the case, on seven-day remand and Ripon Das on five-day remand. A total of six cases were filed so far over incidents centring the murder of lawyer Saiful Islam Alif in the court building area in Chattogram city. Charges in these cases included, among others, obstructing government officers from performing their duty and vandalism. Of the six cases, three have been filed by the police, while the victim’s family filed two cases, and a businessman filed the rest one. A total of 38 people have been arrested in connection with the killing of Saiful. On Tuesday, the court of Chattogram Metropolitan Sessions Judge Saiful Islam rescheduled the bail hearing for Chinmoy Krishna Das for January 2 as no defence lawyer appeared on his behalf. Chinmoy was sent to jail after his bail petition was rejected on November 26. He was arrested on sedition charges on November 25 in Dhaka city.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252534/ctg-court-puts-12-on-remand
"HC questions player, staff quotas in DU admission","The High Court on Tuesday issued a rule asking Dhaka University authorities to explain within two weeks why the quotas for the children of university teachers and employees and the sports quota in admission should not be declared illegal. The bench of Justice Fahmida Quader and Justice Mubina Asaf issued the directive following a writ petition filed by 10 individuals, including lawyers, a rights organisation and a guardian of an admission seeker. Petitioners’ lawyers, Humayun Kabir Pallob and Sulaiman Tushar, argued that the reserved seats for the children of teaching other staff of the university as well as for players contradicted with the Appellate Division’s landmark verdict on July 21 which abolished job quotas in the wake of nationwide student protests. The Appellate Division’s decision, however, maintained a 7 per cent reservation in government jobs, specifically allocating 5 per cent for children of freedom fighters and war-time rape victims (Biranganas), 1 per cent for national minorities, and 1 per cent for persons with disabilities and third-gender individuals. The lawyers contended that extending special privileges for the children of teachers and employees as well as sportspersons in DU admission undermined the principle of meritocracy. ‘These quotas not only deviate from the spirit of equal opportunity but also contradict with the student movement against discrimination that toppled Sheikh Hasina regime on August 5,’ Humayun Kabir Pallob said. The petitioners raised concerns about the players’ quota in particular, saying that it was susceptible to favouritism and corruption. They pointed out that under the current policy, children of the university staff could secure admission by merely achieving the minimum pass marks in admission tests, often at the expense of meritorious candidates who scored higher but were denied admission. The rule comes amid growing calls for reform in the admission process of the public universities, with the critics urging institutions like Dhaka University to uphold merit-based selection to ensure quality education and fair opportunities for all students.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252533/hc-questions-player-staff-quotas-in-du-admission
"List of 1,156 rivers published","Bangladesh government on Tuesday published a primary list of 1,156 rivers across the country to finalise rivers’ list by the next Bengali New Year after necessary verification. The ministry of shipping and the water resources ministry jointly would prepare the unified list since the different agencies of the government maintain different lists of rivers that created controversy. Environment and water resources ministry Syeda Rizwana Hasan asked the land ministry to come forward to solve the confusion. ‘If records miss any river name, I will instruct DCs to verify and send them to us. The list of rivers must be accurate. Our work will not end with publishing the final list on Pahela Baishakh,’ she said at an event at Pani Bhaban in the capital. She said that once they could make the list of rivers, they would include details such as the length, width, condition, and other characteristics of each river. The list will incorporate both official and local names of rivers. Shipping adviser Brig Gen Shakhawat Hossain said that the rivers should be reclaimed now. ‘I will support the river reclaim drive to make them free from pollution,’ he said. The seminar also revealed that the National River Protection Commission’s 2023 list recorded 1,008 rivers. From this list, 224 rivers were not proposed for inclusion in the current list from field-level data. Similarly, out of 405 rivers listed by the Bangladesh Water Development Board in 2011, 18 were excluded from field-level proposals for the current list.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252532/list-of-1156-rivers-published
South Korea slaps travel bans on more top officials,"South Korean authorities banned more top officials from leaving the country Tuesday, in the wake of president Yoon Suk Yeol’s bungled attempt to impose martial law. A day after Yoon himself was hit with a travel ban, his party was meanwhile forging a ‘resignation roadmap’ that reportedly could see him step down in February or March before fresh elections, while the opposition plans to organise an impeachment vote every Saturday. Yoon suspended civilian rule a week ago and sent special forces and helicopters to parliament, before lawmakers forced him to rescind the decree in a country assumed to be a stable democracy. Investigators are probing the president and a cabal of allies — many from the same school — for alleged insurrection over the sequence of extraordinary events. On Tuesday Cho Ji-ho, commissioner general of the Korean National Police Agency, and two other top police officials became the latest to be barred from foreign travel, police said. Already under a travel ban are the former defence and interior ministers and martial law commander General Park An-su, who along with other top brass was grilled by lawmakers on Tuesday. Yoon narrowly survived an impeachment effort in parliament on Saturday as tens of thousands braved freezing temperatures to call for his ouster. The motion failed after members of Yoon’s ruling People Power Party walked out of parliament, depriving it of the necessary two-thirds majority. The offices of ruling party lawmakers were being vandalised, local media said Tuesday, with one image showing a door covered in what appeared to be ketchup and eggs and flour scattered on the floor. Protesters were also sending condolence flowers to the offices, typically reserved for funerals, to express their opposition to the boycott, with signs that read ‘insurrection accomplices’. Local police in Seoul’s Dobong district said that an unspecified ‘weapon’ was found in front of PPP lawmaker Kim Jae-sub’s residence, and he has requested personal protection measures from the police. Kim Yong-hyun, the former defence minister, was detained on Sunday and late Monday prosecutors filed a formal arrest warrant against him. Charges included ‘engaging in critical duties during an insurrection’ and ‘abuse of authority to obstruct the exercise of rights’. A Seoul court will hold a hearing later Tuesday to rule on whether to issue the warrant for Kim, the first court decision to be made related to the martial law chaos. Kim issued contrite comments Tuesday saying that ‘all responsibility for this situation lies solely with me’. Kim ‘deeply apologised’ to the South Korean people and said that his subordinates were ‘merely following my orders and fulfilling their assigned duties’, in a statement made through his lawyers. Kwak Jong-geun, Army Special Warfare Command chief, said Tuesday that he was ordered to stop enough lawmakers from gathering at parliament to vote down Yoon’s martial law decree. ‘The president called me directly through a secret line. He mentioned that it appears the quorum has not yet been met and instructed me to quickly break down the door and drag out the people lawmakers inside,’ Kwak said. At least several hundred protesters held more rallies on Tuesday evening outside the National Assembly, waving glow sticks and holding signs that read, ‘Impeach Yoon Suk Yeol, the insurrection criminal.’ The PPP says that Yoon, 63, has agreed to hand power to the prime minister and party chief, prompting the opposition to accuse it of a ‘second coup’. Local media reported on Tuesday that the PPP will announce a ‘resignation road map’ soon in order to head off a new impeachment motion, which the opposition wants to put before lawmakers on Saturday. The party’s task force was also reportedly reviewing two options, including for Yoon to resign in February with an April election, or to step down in March with a vote in May. With the opposition holding 192 seats in the 300-strong parliament, only eight PPP members need to vote in favour of the new impeachment motion for it to pass. Last week two PPP lawmakers — Ahn Cheol-soo and Kim Yea-ji — voted in favour but on Tuesday two more said they would support the motion this time. Ahn, a self-made multi-millionaire, trained doctor and software designer, said on Monday that he was booed and heckled at a party meeting. ‘The idea that a president responsible for upholding the constitution of the world’s 10th largest economy would stage an unconstitutional coup is beyond imagination,’ Ahn said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/252531/south-korea-slaps-travel-bans-on-more-top-officials
"104 journalists killed in 2024, over half in Gaza","This year has been ‘particularly deadly’ for journalists with 104 killed worldwide, over half of them being in Gaza, the International Federation of Journalists said Tuesday. The toll for 2024 is down on the 129 deaths in 2023 but still makes it ‘one of the worst years’ on record, IFJ general secretary Anthony Bellanger said. According to the figures collated by the press group 55 Palestinian media workers were killed in 2024 in the face of Israel’s offensive in Gaza. ‘Since the start of the war on 7 October 2023, at least 138 Palestinian journalists have been killed,’ the federation said. Bellanger condemned the ‘massacre that is happening before the eyes of the world’. He said that ‘many journalists were targeted’ in Gaza deliberately, while others had found themselves ‘in the wrong place, at the wrong time’ in the fighting. After the Middle East, the second most dangerous region for journalists was Asia with 20 killed, including six in Pakistan, five in Bangladesh and three in India. In Europe, the war in Ukraine continued to claim journalist victims with four killed in 2024. Meanwhile, the IFJ said that across the globe 520 journalists were in prison — a sharp uptick on the 427 being held behind bars last year. China topped the list as the worst jailer of reporters with 135 being detained, including in Hong Kong, where the authorities have been criticised by Western nations for imposing national security laws quashing dissent and other freedoms. The IFJ’s count for the number of journalists killed is typically far higher than that of Reporters Without Borders, due to different counting methods. In 2023 Reporters Without Borders said 54 journalists and two collaborators were killed in the course of their work. The NGO will publish its own figure for 2024 later this week.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252530/104-journalists-killed-in-2024-over-half-in-gaza
Lanka welcomes US sanctions on former ruling clan,"Sri Lanka’s new government on Tuesday welcomed US sanctions against two senior figures from the former ruling Rajapaksa family over two notorious graft cases involving aircraft purchases. Former ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga and former SriLankan Airlines chief Kapila Chandrasena were among 14 people sanctioned by Washington on Monday ‘to promote accountability for perpetrators of corruption’. Weeratunga is a first cousin of Mahinda and Gotabaya Rajapaksa, both former presidents of the island nation, while Chandrasena is related to the clan by marriage. Information minister Nalinda Jayatissa said the State Department action would be a ‘catalyst’ to reexamine several corruption cases from the time the Rajapaksas were in power. ‘We are reopening those old cases. We need some time to ensure proper investigations and bring these people to justice,’ he told reporters. Weeratunga and Chandrasena will be barred from entering the United States as a result of the sanctions and US entities will also be banned from conducting any transactions with either man. Their immediate family members have also been sanctioned. Both men held their offices during Mahinda Rajapaksa’s presidency, which ended in 2015. ‘Weeratunga orchestrated and personally benefitted from a corrupt scheme involving the procurement of MiG aircraft for the Sri Lankan Air Force,’ the US sanctions notice said. ‘Chandrasena accepted a bribe while serving in his capacity as Sri Lankan Airlines CEO in exchange for ensuring Sri Lanka purchased Airbus aircraft for over market value.’ Legal action had been initiated against both years earlier, but there has been no progress in their prosecutions. Chandrasena was accused of receiving a $2 million advance out of a bigger kickback in return for the 2013 purchase of eight A350 aircraft. The Sri Lankan Air Force is alleged to have paid twice the price of four used Russian MiG fighter jets with the extra money going into private pockets. Prominent anti-establishment newspaper editor Lasantha Wickrematunge had exposed the MiG purchase as a corrupt transaction. Wickrematunge was assassinated in January 2009, two days before he was due to appear as the defendant in a defamation case related to the scandal. Days before his murder, he had told other Sri Lankan journalists he intended to lodge documents relating to the MiG purchase with the court to ensure they were in the public record. At the time of the MiG deal, the defence ministry was helmed by Mahinda’s younger brother Gotabaya, who was himself later elected president before his 2022 overthrow during an economic crisis.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/252529/lanka-welcomes-us-sanctions-on-former-ruling-clan
"SC stays HC verdict on Tarique, Mamun","The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed seven-year jail sentence of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting chairman Tarique Rahman and businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun in a case lodged over money laundering. A four-member apex court bench, headed by chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, passed the order granting a leave to appeal petition filed against the High Court judgment. ‘The High Court convicted and sentenced him, whereas the lower court concerned had acquitted him in the case. We had filed the leave to appeal petition against the High Court judgment. Today [Tuesday] the apex court granted that plea, staying the High Court judgment as well. The court asked both the parties to submit the summaries of our plea by December 31,’ Tarique Rahman’s counsel Kaiser Kamal said. The High Court on July 21, 2016, sentenced Tarique Rahman to seven-year imprisonment and fined him Tk 20 crore, scraping his sentence of acquittal in a money laundering case. A High Court division bench comprising justices M Enayetur Rahim and Amir Hossain passed the order, repealing a lower court order that had acquitted the BNP leader in the case. The court, however, upheld the lower court sentence of seven-year imprisonment for Giasuddin Al Mamun while commuting his fine of Tk 40 crore to Tk 20 crore. According to the case document, Anti-Corruption Commission filed the case against Tarique and Mamun for taking more than Tk 20 crore as bribe and laundered it abroad. Dhaka 3rd special judge Md Motahar Hossain on November 17, 2013, acquitted Tarique from the charges and sentenced Mamun to seven-year imprisonment and fined him Tk 40 crore.

Bangladesh elected as UNHCR VP,"Bangladesh has been elected unanimously to serve as a vice-president of the United Nations Human Rights Council, the prime intergovernmental body of the UN responsible for the promotion and protection of all human rights around the globe. The decision was made Monday afternoon, when the council met for an organisational session pertinent to its work for the year 2025, according to message received on Tuesday. As an elected vice-president, the permanent representative of Bangladesh to the UN and other international organisations in Geneva will join the bureau of the Human Rights Council from January 1 to December 31, 2025. The bureau of the Human Rights Council consists of one president and four vice-presidents representing each of the five UN regional groups. The election process for vice-presidency started in October 2024, when Bangladesh expressed its interest in serving in the bureau as the vice-president representing the Asia-Pacific Group. The group unanimously supported the candidature of Bangladesh for the vice-presidency and forwarded the nomination for the consideration of the wider memberships of the council. Finally, the process culminated successfully when Bangladesh earned unanimous support of the entire council membership to serve as vice-president. This marks the first time that Bangladesh is going to serve as the vice-president of this prestigious UN human rights body since the Human Rights Council was established by the UN General Assembly in 2006. ‘This is yet another example of the trust and confidence that the international community reposes on Bangladesh under the prudent leadership of the chief adviser professor Muhammad Yunus as well as recognition of the active role and growing influence of Bangladesh in multilateralism,’ said the foreign ministry.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252527/bangladesh-elected-as-unhcr-vp

Ex-MP Poton granted six-month bail,"The High Court has granted six months’ bail to former lawmaker Kamrul Ashraf Khan Poton, owner of M/S Poton Traders, in a high-profile case involving the embezzlement of 72,000 tonnes of government-imported urea fertiliser valued at Tk 582 crore. The alleged misappropriation of Poton, a former independent lawmaker from Narsingdi 2 constituency, occurred during the Awami League regime hit newspaper headline. The bench of Justice Md Iqbal Kabir and Justice Md Riaz Uddin Khan issued the bail order on Monday, asking the Anti-Corruption Commission to explain why Poton should not be granted regular bail. This bail was granted after a fresh application was submitted to the High Court after toppling of Awami League government on August 5, challenging a lower court’s decision to deny Poton’s bail plea. The application followed the earlier rejection of a rule issued by a different High Court bench in June 2024, which had also asked the ACC to justify its opposition to granting bail. Deputy attorney general Farid Uddin Khan said that a recommendation was sent to the Attorney General for filing an appeal against Poton’s bail, citing the scale of the alleged embezzlement, which had drawn widespread attention during the Awami League government. Additional attorney general Aneek R Hoque and ACC lawyer Shahin Ahmed  also opposed Poton’s bail. The ACC filed the case on November 26, 2023, accusing Poton and four associates of misappropriating government-imported fertiliser during transportation. The case alleges that this act caused significant financial losses to the state. Earlier, the High Court had granted bail to Poton, but the Appellate Division stayed the order on June 12, 2024, in response to an ACC appeal. The Supreme Court then directed the High Court to dispose of the pending rule. Poton’s new lawyer, Mohammad Hossain Lipu, stated that the fresh bail plea was based on procedural grounds and sought relief against the lower court’s rejection of Poton’s earlier application. Senior pro-Bangladesh Nationalist Party lawyer Ruhul Quddus Kazal moved Poton’s new application seeking bail.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252524/ex-mp-poton-granted-six-month-bail

"Punishment of Hasina, cohorts demanded","Marking the International Human Rights Day on Tuesday, oppression victims, their families, political and student leaders renewed the call for ensuring punishment for Sheikh Hasina and her accomplices for gross human rights violations during Awami League’s misrule of over 15 years. They also said that AL could not be allowed to involve in politics without ensuring justice for the victims of enforcement disappearances and extrajudicial killings, BDR carnage, killings during Hefazat rally and  student-people mass uprising. People from all walks of life need to be united to resist all conspiracies hatched by the Indian government in recent times, speakers said at a mass gathering organised by Mayer Daak, a platform of enforced disappearance and extrajudicial killing victims’ family members, at Suhrawardy Udyan in the capital. ‘I demand to the interim government for ensuring punishment of Sheikh Hasina and her collaborators at the earliest for killing people indiscriminately,’ said Korban Sheikh Hillol, who lost eyesight during the student-mass movement on August 5 in police firing. According to the interim government latest data, about 1500 people were killed and 19,931 were injured during the July mass uprising. Adiba Islam Ridhi, whose father disappeared in December 2013 and still traceless, said ‘We still don’t know where my father is. I demand trial of the people involved in disappearing my father forcibly.’ On November 5, the Commission for Inquiry into Enforced Disappearances that it had received over 1,600 complaints of disappearance incidents occurred during the 15-year rule of Awami League. The complaints were lodged from September 15 to October 31 this year by the enforced disappearance victims and their families. About 200 of the victims are still traceless. Maayer Daak co-founder Sanjida Islam Tulee said that it was the biggest event of the platform and it could be possible due to ouster of Sheikh Hasina. Bangladesh Nationalist Party standing committee member Abdul Moyeen Khan said that fascist AL government had committed extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances as their views went against AL. ‘AL had proved time and again as a human rights violator party. We also demand punishment of Sheikh Hasina and her collaborators,’ he added. Addressing the event, Student Movement Against Discrimination convener Hasnat Abdullah said that AL would not be allowed to involve in politics or take part in elections before ensuring punishment for extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances. ‘The Awami League did not even say sorry after killing about 2,000 people in July uprising. There will be no compromise with AL,’ said Hasnat, urging people from all walks of life to unite to resist Indian Narenda Modi’s conspiracy to divide the protesters. Posts, Telecommunications, and Information Technology adviser Nahid Islam said that AL was a party that never respected humanism. ‘We have to ensure punishment of Awami League people for their misdeeds. If anyone tries to rehabilitee AL, they will be identified as mass enemy,’ he added. On February 25–26, 2009 rebellion in the erstwhile Bangladesh Rifles carnage left 75 people, including 57 army officials killed. Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Mia Golam Parwar said that Sheikh Hasina had ordered the BDR carnage in a planned way. He said that AL had to be resisted in a united way through a proper electoral system. Jatiya Nagorik Committee convener Nasir Uddin Patwary said that they would not allow any elections before ensuring trial of Hasina and her collaborators.

BNP for RAB’s abolition,"The Bangladesh Nationalist Party recommended the abolition of the Rapid Action Battalion, citing allegations of human rights violations and extrajudicial killings. It made the recommendation to the Police Reform Committee the interim government has recently formed. BNP standing committee member retired major Hafizuddin Ahmed came up with the recommendation at a press conference on Tuesday at the party chairperson’s office at Gulshan in the capital. Mentioning that the force already faced harsh criticism at home and abroad, he said that the RAB became a ‘monster’ in the eyes of the country’s people. ‘We recommend the RAB’s abolition for their involvement in extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances and we believe that its abolition would send  a positive message to people,’ he added. Hafiz also said that necessary measures could be taken to enable the police force along with its specialised forces, including the Armed Police Battalion, to carry out the responsibilities of the Rapid Action Battalion. He further said that both local and international human rights organisations, the United Nations, most political parties, and the public blamed the RAB for most of the incidents of enforced disappearances, killings, torture and repression. Hafiz at the briefing also referred to the United States’ sanctioning of the force over allegations of human rights violation. The Rapid Action Battalion was founded on March 26, 2004 during the BNP-led four-party alliance government to curb organised crimes and terrorism. Since its very establishment the force had remained under intense scrutiny, facing serious allegations of human rights violations. The party also gave other reform recommendations, including forming a police commission, to the Police Reform Commission. It has suggested formation of an eight-member Police Commission headed by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs chairman to properly guide, advise and support the police force. One of its recommendations is to form a citizen committee in every upazila or police station jurisdiction to support the police in combating crimes at the local level, improving public-police relations, and giving advice on maintaining law and order. The chair of the committee would be an eminent person of the respective area and the officer-in-charge of the police station concerned would be its member secretary, the BNP suggested as the possible structure of its proposed citizen committees. They also recommended strengthening of community policing, saying that community policing would reduce various crimes and social unrest, help bridge the gap between the police and the public, and increase public awareness. Hafiz further said that after the fall of the Awami League regime on August 5, a total of 488 police officers took shelter at the cantonment who he said were involved with enforced disappearances, killings and corruption. The army did not do the right thing by giving them shelter as they were offenders, the retired serviceman said. Enforced disappearances, killings and repression of the opposition people perpetrated by the Awami regime turned the country into a ‘police state’, he added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/252519/bnp-for-rabs-abolition
"Tk 27,000cr withdrawn after AL ouster","The number of bank accounts holding deposits exceeding Tk 1 crore dropped by 1,657 as of September, equivalent Tk 27,000 cr due to withdrawal pressure particularly from Awami League connected individuals. According to central bank data, the number of such accounts stood at 1,17,127  during July- September, down from 1,18,784 at the end of June, when the number reached peak. By the end of September, the total deposits in the banking sector were recorded at Tk 18.25 lakh crore, with Tk 7.46 lakh crore held in accounts with more than Tk 1 crore. However, it marked a decline of Tk 27,000 crore from June’s figure of Tk 7.73 lakh crore. The number of such accounts was 1,15,890 accounts in March and 1,16,908 at the end of December 2022. Banking insiders attribute this decline to the political turbulence following the fall of the Awami League-led government on August 5. Many individuals associated with the Awami League reportedly withdrew large sums, transferring money abroad amidst fears of political fallout. This capital flight along with intensified scrutiny from regulatory agencies worsened the situation for them. The Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU) has frozen numerous accounts linked to businesses, politicians, and activists associated with the party. Moreover, agencies such as the Anti-Corruption Commission and the Criminal Investigation Department have ramped up efforts to identify individuals accused of amassing wealth through illicit means. Some supporters of the Awami League have gone into hiding, while others have left the country to avoid legal or financial repercussions. Mainul Islam, former professor of economics at Chittagong University, told New Age that the current political unrest has significantly contributed to heightened withdrawals from banks. He explained that many influential individuals, particularly politicians, began withdrawing large sums of money following the intensification of the student-led protests in July. These funds, he noted, were transferred abroad, with most of these individuals fled overseas to lead a comfortable life. He expressed grave concerns about the uncertainty surrounding the banking sector, emphasizing that recovery seems unlikely in the near future due to the absence of tangible improvements. Highlighting the fragile state of the sector, he pointed out that 10 to 11 banks are in particularly precarious conditions. The professor questioned whether the central bank possesses the capacity or strategy to salvage these troubled institutions effectively, given the severity of their crises. Additionally, the Bangladesh Bank has restructured the boards of 11 banks due to widespread irregularities and loan scams. This move, while necessary, has contributed to depositor anxiety, leading to further withdrawals. The situation was exacerbated when the newly appointed BB governor, Ahsan H Mansur, publicly acknowledged that around 10 banks faced potential bankruptcy. His statement intensified depositors’ concerns, prompting a surge in withdrawals that many banks struggled to manage. Out of Bangladesh’s 16.20 crore bank accounts, 11.73 crore accounts hold less than Tk 5,000, while accounts with deposits exceeding Tk 1 crore represent only 0.073 per cent of the total. Despite their small number, these high-value accounts account for approximately 40 per cent of the sector’s aggregate deposits, reflecting a disproportionate concentration of wealth. Among the high-value accounts, 1,800 accounts held deposits exceeding Tk 50 crore each, collectively amounting to more than Tk 2.51 lakh crore. Despite this decline, the trend of growth in high-value accounts has been consistent over recent years, increasing from 75,563 accounts in December 2018 to 1,01,976 by December 2021. However, the recent economic and political challenges have disrupted this growth trajectory. Experts said that persistent inflation, political unrest, energy shortages, and high dollar rates have constrained businesses’ profitability, reducing their capacity to maintain large bank deposits. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics reported an inflation rate of 11.38 per cent in November, with overall inflation exceeding 9 per cent for 20 consecutive months, driven by escalating commodity prices. High inflation has also led many individuals to hold onto cash rather than keep it in banks.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252518/tk-27000cr-withdrawn-after-al-ouster
Winning support from international community,"PRESIDENT Anura Kumara Dissanayake is scheduled to make his first international visit to India this week. This is expected to be followed by a visit to China in close order.  The president, and the country itself, is walking a tightrope between these two Asian giants, one which is the world’s second largest economy and other it’s fifth largest. Both of them see the island of Sri Lanka as a strategic location for their geopolitical aims. In the case of India, the stakes are particularly high as it does not wish China to pose a military challenge to it in the south when it is a belligerent power in the north where the two countries have gone to war over territory each claims for itself. The manner in which the government is seeking to project the two visits that the president is to make is to call them economic investment-related visits. Indeed, both countries hold keys to Sri Lanka’s future prosperity. If they invest in productive enterprises, they will enable Sri Lanka to provide jobs to its people and perhaps keep them at home instead of migrating in droves to foreign countries for employment.  Increased economic production as a result of foreign investment can also reduce the heavy burden of foreign loan repayments that impoverish the people. Loans that are used in corrupt ways are no substitute for foreign investment in economic enterprises. So far Sri Lanka has been walking the tightrope between giving preference to the countries that have sustained the economy after the economic bankruptcy. The role that India played in giving emergency assistance during the height of the crisis in 2021 cannot be forgotten. Thereafter Sri Lanka has accepted the IMF loans and the new government continues to abide by its terms. In the past, the JVP leadership opposed deals with the IMF or compromise with the UN on issues it saw as being in the realm of protecting the country’s sovereignty. The most positive feature of the NPP government is its rationality in doing what is necessary to protect the country’s interests even if it is not in alignment with positions taken by its own leadership in the past.  This can be seen in relation to the IMF agreement, the approach to the UN Human Rights Commission and on inter-ethnic peacebuilding.  Anti-corruption drive THE visit of US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian Affairs, Donald Lu went smoothly with the president’s media division describing the outcome as being one in which the US envoy pledged ‘Unwavering Support for Sri Lanka’s Anti-Corruption Drive.’ It also reported that the US is prepared to provide financial and technical assistance to strengthen Sri Lanka’s security and economy. Assistant secretary Lu had also emphasised the US government’s willingness to offer technical expertise to help recover funds that were illegally taken out of the country, as part of Sri Lanka’s anti-corruption programme. The government’s positive understanding of the meeting was also that ‘The discussion highlighted the US government’s appreciation for the new administration’s prioritisation of key political, economic, and social challenges.’ The driving force behind the Aragalaya people’s movement that drove the then government out of power despite its nearly two-thirds majority in parliament was the belief that corruption at the highest levels of that government was responsible for the economic debacle the country faced in 2021. There is a consensus in the country that crosses all its main divides, ethnic, religious and class, that corruption in high places is an evil that needs to be dealt with. The failure of previous governments to deal with this problem, notwithstanding their promises to do so, was the lack of internal political will. The unfortunate reality was that those at the helm of government were themselves complicit in the corruption they pledged to bring to an end. The unique feature of the NPP government is that its leading members are not known to be complicit in corruption due to their ideological convictions and modest lifestyles. They have also not held positions of power to be tested nor do they appear to have personal relationships with those believed to be corrupt. The government’s commitment to ensuring that there will be no corruption and the general population’s alignment with that commitment provides the country with the opportunity to accept the US offer to help it tackle the problem of corruption. The modern digital economy that the government is emphasising offers the best possibility of containing such corruption by the publication of all large calls for proposals or calls for tenders on a public website. Civil society think tank, Verite Research is currently completing a study on detecting corruption in procurement practices. The worst forms of corruption that cost, and continue to cost, the country billions have come as a result of corrupt contracts, unsolicited project proposals, where there is no competitive bidding and where there is no visibility.  Consensus building THE main constraint to the government’s success at the present time is the lack of economic resources due to the profligacy and corruption of the past. It is difficult to understand the rationale why the previous government under president Gotabaya Rajapaksa thought it fit to reject the USD 450 milllion grant that the US was willing to provide to improve the country’s road and transport system under the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the USD 1.2 billion long term low interest loan that Japan offered to set up a light rail transport system. At the present time these appear to be lost opportunities, though the new government needs to keep trying in the hope that fortune can smile a second time.  Sri Lanka’s location in the Indian Ocean and its importance to the sea lanes is an asset that needs to yield positive returns to the country. During his visit, assistant secretary Lu offered a different financial assistance programme in the form of anti-corruption systems that could, potentially, bring in millions of revenue that are currently lost to the government.  Enhanced revenue flows from taxes and customs revenues that are properly collected could lead to a corresponding reduction of the tax burden placed on the masses of people through unjust taxes such as the VAT which falls especially hard on the poorest sections of society, although they are the easiest taxes to collect. There will be massive cost savings and revenue generation if contracts are awarded in term of economic merit and not done in a corrupt manner.  Anti-corruption measures that the international community can support Sri Lanka with could be quickly put in place as there will be no resistance to them from the general population, although there will surely be vested interests which will resist such anti-corruption measures. The government will, however, be less willing to accept the offer of international assistance when it comes to issues on which the population is divided and not of one mind. The government faces challenges in navigating divisive issues like national security and ethnic conflict as seen recently on the Heroes Day celebrations. While international assistance in areas like corruption finds public backing, issues like replacing laws such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Online Safety Act which empowers it to take action in the name of national security or addressing ethnic power-sharing require careful consensus-building. Policies that risk further polarising communities could undermine stability. This is where special emphasis needs to be placed on peacebuilding and social cohesion building which requires dialogue both within and outside the country in forums such as the UN Human Rights Council.

Reflection of deep-rooted issues,"BANGLADESH is home to both ethnic and religious minorities. In many cases, ethnic minorities also belong to the category of religious minorities. For example, religious minorities such as the Hindus and the Christians include many ethnically Bengali individuals. The Hindus represent the most significant minority group, both in terms of population and for political and historical reasons. South Asia has experienced significant and persistent ethnic conflicts rooted in historical divisions that emerged with the establishment of modern nation-states. The tension was exacerbated by British colonial policies, which strategically manipulated communal identities and fuelled societal divisions. The fracturing of local communities undermined social cohesion and served the interests of the British raj and in the subsequent period after India’s independence. Thus, the Hindu-Muslim divide has been constructed and has been played on and exploited by the political elite most effectively and almost in a routine manner for their benefits in the name of ‘nation’ and ‘state.’ Bangladesh’s interplay of identity, history and politics demands a nuanced understanding of its sociopolitical landscape. Islam is deeply embedded in the nation’s culture and politics. While Bengali nationalism had a territorial aspect, Bangladeshi nationalism’s evolution in 1975 marked a significant resurgence of Muslim identity, gaining widespread acceptance among the population. The ethnic divisions heightened by the British colonial rule continue to influence modern political discourse, often impacting the Hindu community in Bangladesh the most. While other minorities, like those in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, also face significant challenges, the unique historial and political legacy of the Hindus has intensified their ethnic identity, which is frequently and sometimes inaccurately linked to India. The Hindu community in Bangladesh faces political and economic insecurity, often targeted by vested interests under the guise of religious sentiments, particularly in land grabbing. This insecurity intensified after the Babri Masjid incident in India, leading to anti-Hindu riots in Bangladesh in 1990 and 1992, which resulted in attacks on temples and a subsequent out-migration. This tense atmosphere has affected Bangladesh-India relations and fuelled anti-Muslim propaganda in India, further complicating the situation for the Hindus in Bangladesh. Majoritarian democracy has turned politics into a game of numbers. Human beings and communities have been turned into vote banks and constituencies. This dehumanising of politics took a hideous form in the October 2001 elections in Bangladesh. Minorities, especially the Hindu community, were targeted. The reasons for violence against them were not limited to communal factors. Instead, the main factors behind such actions were purely political and structural. The Gujarat riots in the preceding year in India did not help the situation, fuelling anti-India sentiments. Despite various circumstances, it is essential to note that the long-standing anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh has, unfortunately, been exploited for personal gain and has led to violence and violations against the Hindus. Religious extremists within the Muslim majority have caused significant suffering to many innocent Hindus. India’s unequivocal, unapologetic and unwavering support for the Sheikh Hasina-led government, along with its direct involvement in Bangladesh’s policies and politics, has contributed to a rising anti-India sentiment. As the Narendra Modi-led government in India increasingly adopts an anti-Muslim stance, often using Bangladesh as a focal point for its hostility towards Muslims, incidents such as the attack on Muslims in Delhi and reports of vigilante assaults on mosques and members of the Muslim community have intensified this sentiment. Consequently, the anti-India feeling has taken on a religio-political tone. For instance, despite mass demonstration in 2022 protesting at the comments by Bharatiya Janata Party leaders defaming the Prophet, the Awami League government remained silent, which was yet another gesture of the AL government’s subservience. Instead of addressing the challenges faced by the Hindus, political parties — particularly the Awami League — have historically politicised their struggles. The Hindus are viewed as a vote bank for the Awami League, making them targets for opposition parties and their allies. In some cases, supporters of the Awami League have attacked local Hindus, believing they did not vote for the party as expected. Additionally, terrorists have exploited this situation to engage in extortion and looting. The increasingly anti-Muslim narrative propagated by the Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party, along with anti-Islamic propaganda and attacks on the Muslims, coupled with Indian support for the Awami League and the now-deposed prime minister Hasina, further complicates the situation. These perceived ongoing efforts of India to undermine the interim government in Bangladesh are not helping matters either. Several Indian media and experts try to portray the anti-India sentiment as an Islamic extremist narrative and Chinese influence. However, the reality is not so. During the August uprising in Bangladesh, Indian media claimed that Chinese and Pakistani intelligence were linked to the protests, exaggerating attacks on the Hindus. As Hasina fled the country, reports tried to suggest that the Inter-Services Intelligence aimed at turning Bangladesh into an Islamic state with support from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jamaat-e-Islami. The aftermath of the political crisis in Bangladesh has once again made the Hindu community a vulnerable target. The student protests quickly became a pretext for vigilantes and vested interests to perpetrate violence against the Hindus. Within just a day and a half after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government, the country experienced a surge in violence explicitly targeting Hindu houses and places of worship in several districts. Although tension had become manageable in successive weeks, the ISKCON leader issue in recent weeks has exacerbated the situation once more. Several Islamist political parties, including the far-right Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh, have called for a ban on ISKCON in Bangladesh. An organiser of the student-led uprising that overthrew Hasina posted on social media, labelling ISKCON as an ‘extremist’ group that is ‘trying to implement various treasonous plots to destabilise’ Bangladesh. Religious tension is escalating in Bangladesh after violence related to the arrest of a Hindu religious leader in Chittagong. Hindu leader Chinmoy Krishna Das was denied bail on charges of sedition on Tuesday for allegedly insulting Bangladesh’s flag during a rally in October. In response, the police reported that hundreds of his supporters clashed with security forces as Das was being carried back to jail. During the confrontation, a Muslim lawyer named Saiful Islam Alif was killed. In the aftermath of the incident, some Muslim groups have called for action against the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Although Bangladesh ISKCON stated that Chinmoy Krishna Das was expelled from the organisation in July because of disciplinary issues, the president of ISKCON Bangladesh claimed that Das defied the order and continued his activities. Nevertheless, ISKCON Bangladesh and the global ISKCON also issued statements condemning the arrest. Regrettably, there is a troubling rise in Hindu extremism in the country, evident in social media narratives and violent actions, such as the mob lynching of two brothers in Faridpur in late April. This trend highlights the ongoing exploitation of religious tensions by various vested interests. Under prime minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party, the surge in Hindu nationalism in India has marginalised not only Muslims but also other religious groups. Legislative measures promoting cow protection have fuelled extremist organisations that receive support from the Bharatiya Janata Party. Scholars warn that state propaganda and communal violence are fostering a ‘Nazi conscience’ among the Hindu majority, leading to moral justification for violence. This shift raises alarm among the Muslim majority in Bangladesh, heightening anxiety and emboldening local Muslim extremists. Disillusioned by the treatment of Muslims in India, some Bangladeshi Muslims are responding with hostility towards Hindu minorities. This escalating tension demands vigilance to prevent a cycle of retaliation. ISKCON is seen by many as a significant promoter of growing Hindu extremism, particularly highlighted by an incident at an annual book fair in Bangladesh. During this event, the Awami League government allowed ISKCON to have a separate stall while publishers of Islamic books were denied space. When the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh condemned atrocities on the Hindus and minorities in Bangladesh and demanded the release of ISKCON monk, the concerns stated above only became more pronounced. Deep-seated beliefs, regional factors and sentiments against India shape the religious tensions in Bangladesh. Bangladesh and India’s relationship is being re-evaluated with the interim government in power. The interim government has committed to conducting free and fair elections. However, there is growing concern in New Delhi that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which has historically had a hostile stance towards India, may win overwhelmingly. Since the decline of the Awami League, no political party has been as popular or influential as the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. This potential outcome raises alarms in New Delhi regarding the strategic stability of India’s north-eastern region, which shares a border with Bangladesh, as well as Dhaka’s shifting geopolitical dynamics. With the Indian diaspora in the United States calling for sanctions against Bangladesh, West Bengali chief minister Mamata Banerjee calling for deploying peacekeepers in Bangladesh is undoubtedly calling for increased focus on how Bangladesh needs to calibrate its relations with India. In contexts where national sentiments run high, expressing admiration for even the Indian cricket team can be contentious, particularly in gatherings predominantly composed of Bangladeshis. While appreciation for individual Indian figures such as Sachin Tendulkar, Amitabh Bachchan or Salman Khan may be more palatable, a collective endorsement of anything associated with India often elicits strong negative reactions from a significant portion of the Bangladeshi populace. This phenomenon underscores the complexities of national identity and inter-country perceptions, suggesting that collective representations of India are viewed with scepticism or outright disdain in certain circles. Unfortunately, religion has also become embroiled in this context and the religious tension that we see prevailing in Bangladesh is just a symptomatic reflection, with its roots going deep and wide. India and Bangladesh share a geographically contiguous territory, leading to strong mutual dependence between the two countries that necessitates sharing common resources. India is among Bangladesh’s top 10 sources of foreign direct investment and is the third-largest contributor of bilateral foreign assistance from non-aid group countries. India is Bangladesh’s second-largest trading partner. While historical, economic and strategic ties make India a geopolitical reality of existential scope, India’s approach to Bangladesh must also change based on people-to-people relations and not single-party relations that excessively benefit India.

Straws in Syrian whirlwind,"THE pendulum of zealotry almost always ushers in intellectual subterfuge in its wake. The lightning, if not spontaneous, takeover of Damascus by mediaeval militias is being predictably applauded by Western journalists as an overthrow of a 50-year-old family dictatorship. Some reports added ‘brutal’ to Bashar al-Assad’s long and precarious rule, a description that was carefully mothballed when it came to the horrific crimes still being committed by Benjamin Netanyahu. If one is not alert, gleeful Western reports would suggest that barring Syria, from Morocco on the Atlantic coast to Oman abutting the Arabian Sea, knitting North African regimes with Tel Aviv, Amman, Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, Manama, Doha, Muscat and Sanaa, secular democracy and human rights have been showering their blessings on the region day and night. Since the surmise is ridiculous, how should we proceed to describe the events unfolding in the Levant, to assess them neither as overly chest-thumping nor as needlessly defeatist? To answer the question posed by the Western media’s underhand description of the assault on Syria as liberating, not least since one of the (erstwhile?) throat-slitting zealots in the raiding group told CNN that ‘social diversity’ had become their newly minted virtue, one needs to step back in time to link the brazen hypocrisy with its origins. And we should start not with the 1953 coup against the popularly elected government in Iran. The US has since acknowledged toppling the democratic Mosaddegh government, not so MI6, the author of the coup. Iran in 1936 was instructive differently, when Reza Shah issued a decree known as kashf-i-hijab, banning Islamic veils, including hijab and chador. We are told the order was ‘swiftly and forcefully’ implemented. The ban was lifted in 1941, but it had done the damage. The veil would become a symbol of resistance to the Shah even though women were free to dress as they wished until the Iranian Revolution of 1979. (It was sobering to see the CNN woman interviewing the chief of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham taking the precaution of covering her head with a scarf.) Enforcement of hijab has been the stick to beat the Iranians with even though their democracy, rare in the region, is as good or bad as Israel’s insofar as both are theocratic states. For Syria, which had a reasonably cosmopolitan polity under Assad, the absence of democracy was cited as reason for Western hostility. Truth be told, Assad’s fall completes the toppling of the last of secular Arab entities that challenged bigoted Israel and US with Soviet support. Yemen, Libya, Iraq and PLO stand already destroyed. So, what’s afoot in Syria? Three things come to mind. The march on Damascus targets China and Russia, to hobble their ambitions for BRICS. The presence of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the Kazan summit of BRICS in Russia and the offer to induct Ankara into the club despite it being a NATO member, must have sent shivers down the spines of Western capitals. Erdogan’s thinly veiled role in whipping up the storm in Syria, curious though it seems, may not calm nerves in the West. As things stood, Assad’s Syria had also applied for BRICS membership and Iran is already there, together with Egypt, Ethiopia and the UAE. Saudi Arabia is expected to formally be on board. Pervasive fear of BRICS is a bipartisan affliction in Washington, and Donald Trump has warned against any move to ‘de-dollarise’ the global economy. By most accounts, there is no BRICS move to challenge the dollar anyway, only a plan to skirt its troublesome impositions on vulnerable countries. Significantly, although the Syrian storm did rock the boat for Iran and Russia, their boats still remain tethered to the Syrian jetty. And that could be a worrying story for the West in the coming days. Russia has not vacated, nor seems to be planning to move out its military presence from the country, including its crucial naval base at Tartus. And while the Iranian embassy was ransacked, portraits of slain Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and the Iranian Quds Force chief Qasim Suleimani vandalised, both being staunch adversaries of the militants now controlling Damascus, Iran too is keeping its embassy running. On Saturday, it said it was moving out diplomatic families, but denied a report by the New York Times that it was pulling out military personnel. In fact, Iran’s ambassador to Syria Hossein Akbari spoke to state TV to say the embassy was still open with five to six diplomats and was carrying out high-level meetings to follow up with the overall situation. Iran’s state TV said HTS had guaranteed there would be no disturbance to the Syeda Zeinab shrine in Damascus. A meeting of the foreign ministers of Turkiye, Russia and Iran in Doha on Friday was crucial in this regard. Though the trio formed the Astana group in 2017 to stabilise Syria, Erdogan’s difficult ties with Assad remained legendary. It’s worthwhile, then, to ask why Iran and Russia didn’t bail out Assad this time around. Were they surprised by the stealth and speed of the militias? Or have the Astana trio sacrificed the unpopular Assad with a purpose? True, Iran has lost its handy land link to Hezbollah. By most accounts, that option was torpedoed not by Israeli interdiction of Hezbollah’s supply routes in Syria, but because China and Russia have got bigger fish to fry. And Iran is too precious for both to be allowed into a fruitless military enterprise that wouldn’t have stopped the Israeli genocide of Palestinians. The Palestinians’ rehabilitation now looks more doable under an agreeable mechanism to be shouldered by Arab states and Turkiye. Russia gets back to dictating peace in Ukraine while China stops fretting over the flow of Iranian oil. The zealots in Damascus are enjoying good press, meanwhile, as the Afghan mujahideen once did.

Pressing priorities and vision,"IN ITS first 120 days, Bangladesh’s interim government has made significant strides in stabilising the nation and charting a new course. The interim government’s emphasis on transparency and accountability is evident, with open criticism flourishing in the media and on social platforms — a positive indication of democratic values re-entering public discourse. Backed by strong national and international support, the interim government has introduced several reforms, including public updates and a firm anti-corruption agenda, marking a welcome departure from the secrecy of previous administrations. Key accomplishments include stabilising central bank reserves, establishing reform commissions, engaging the military to assist in maintaining law and order, ensuring the peaceful celebration of the country’s largest Hindu festival, and reopening university campuses. Demonstrating responsiveness, the government recently addressed protests by individuals injured during the mass uprising. When the demonstrators called for improved treatment and financial aid, four advisers engaged with them late at night, promising prompt action and committing funds for their medical care and rehabilitation. This interaction highlights the government’s dedication to tackling urgent public concerns openly and directly — an encouraging move towards restoring trust and reinforcing accountability. As we all know, the fact is that there exists a profound divide between the elite and the working class — a gap that extends beyond economics or culture into the realm of morality. Too often, personal gain has overshadowed integrity, eroding the nation’s social and ethical foundations. For decades, countless Bangladeshis have felt that leaders across the spectrum have prioritised their own interests over the public good, leaving the working class marginalised and neglected. To bridge this divide, the government must navigate complex challenges on several fronts, including economic strains and political factionalism. Striking the right balance between urgent measures and a sustainable long-term strategy is essential. The government is grappling with significant economic challenges. Working people are burdened by high inflation, unemployment, and rising living costs, while local corruption, skyrocketing food and fuel prices, and syndicates in critical sectors highlight the difficulties of breaking entrenched power structures. To gain the trust of the working class, the government’s appeals must be genuine and grounded in tangible change, rather than relying on lofty reform rhetoric or placing blame on the institutional failures of the past 15 years. Political analysts point to a noticeable lack of political acumen within the interim government, as it grapples with balancing the conflicting demands of various factions both inside and outside the government. This struggle appears to be hindering its capacity to produce effective and practical results. The interim government must focus on addressing the immediate needs, concerns, and hopes of the people. For a rickshaw puller or garment worker, issues like central bank reserves or constitutional reforms are secondary to ensuring they can afford food, safeguard their homes from syndicate exploitation, and provide their children with access to education. Initiatives like the Open Market Sales programmes, which offer essential food items at subsidised prices to low-income families, are a positive step in mitigating the effects of rising food inflation. However, these programmes must be scaled up to reach the millions who continue to face hardship. While tackling immediate priorities, the government must also focus on creating a robust governance framework capable of enduring political transitions and safeguarding democratic values. To rebuild public trust, it is crucial to avoid past missteps, such as the sudden abolition of the caretaker government in 2011. Ensuring long-term growth for Bangladesh will require strengthening institutions, establishing clear accountability mechanisms, and maintaining diplomatic stability. People aren’t seeking quick fixes; they want a thoughtful and realistic approach that acknowledges the complexity of the challenges ahead. Rebuilding Bangladesh requires laying a foundation grounded in strong principles and practical, well-considered actions, rather than chasing immediate solutions. After years of empty promises, regime shifts, and unstable constitutional amendments, many are beginning to question whether traditional governance systems remain relevant in addressing contemporary needs. These models were designed for a world shaped by monarchies, colonialism, and industrial revolutions. In 2024, Bangladesh faces unique material and moral challenges that call for a governance framework tailored to today’s realities and resilient enough to endure future uncertainties and political shifts. Bangladesh requires a new governance model grounded in both ideal justice and practical justice. This model must strike a balance between autonomy, inclusivity, and accountability while respecting the country’s distinct cultural, religious, and identity-based characteristics. It is crucial for fostering unity. The interim government’s immediate priorities should include: i) ensuring that high-profile detainees are brought to justice through a transparent judicial process; ii) curbing the influence of syndicates in key sectors such as food and housing; iii) enhancing representation from a broad range of stakeholders in decision-making; and iv) implementing a regular, systematic reporting process to keep the public informed about progress and challenges, fostering trust and transparency. Instead of waiting for another crisis to emerge, the government should address rising discontent, some of which may be driven by rival factions. In addition to these immediate measures, the government must focus on developing a resilient governance model. A ‘Bangladesh 2.0’ framework should combine practical action with principles of justice and inclusivity, establishing institutions that uphold democratic values and learn from past mistakes. Long-term objectives should centre on strengthening institutions, creating clear accountability mechanisms, and ensuring diplomatic stability to support sustainable growth. In international diplomacy, the government faces the challenge of maintaining strong relationships with key allies while upholding Bangladesh’s sovereignty and national interests. With Trump’s re-election and his close ties to Indian prime minister Modi, Bangladesh must navigate this complex terrain by highlighting its dedication to democratic values, stability, and regional cooperation. By reinforcing partnerships with the US on counterterrorism and climate issues while fostering respectful collaboration with India on economic and security matters, the government can safeguard Bangladesh’s interests amid evolving alliances. Additionally, the interim government can capitalise on the unique asset of Professor Yunus and his vast international network to enhance Bangladesh’s diplomatic credibility. Balancing these global relationships with domestic priorities will necessitate skilled negotiation and a strong focus on the interests of the working people. The interim government must adopt principled pragmatism — an approach that combines core values with flexible, practical solutions — to endure political shifts and build resilience. By addressing urgent needs and establishing the foundation for lasting institutions, the government can create a future that honours its people and remains steadfast in the face of future challenges.

Hospitals need to step up efforts to treat cold-related diseases,"AN INCREASE in the number of patients, especially children and the elderly, with complaints of cold-related diseases and death from such diseases warrants special measures. Besides, patients with diseases that are usually aggravated by cold weather, including respiratory problems, diarrhoea, jaundice, skin diseases, fever and others, have crowded hospitals since the onset of the winter. As the Directorate General of Health Services says, at least 19 people died of cold-related diseases and 85,469 others have taken treatment for diseases such as pneumonia, asthma, cold and diarrhoea in November 15–December 8. The Bangladesh Shishu Hospital has reported a sudden surge in the number of patients. Hospital data show that some 130 patients are admitted to the hospital daily and another 1,200 patients are given outdoor treatment. Other hospitals and healthcare facilities have also reported a surge in patients with cold-related diseases. Persistent air pollution in cities, especially in Dhaka and adjacent areas, has made the situation bad for children and the elderly. Physicians say that patients with asthma and other respiratory diseases are the most vulnerable group. With a fall in temperature, which is to continue on and off for two months, cold-related diseases are likely to intensify. Hospitals are already struggling to deliver proper treatment and care facilities for patients. In such a situation, special care needs to be provided for children, the elderly and the homeless to prevent death from cold-related diseases. What is also worrying is that government and privately organised relief distribution often takes place at the fag end of the winter, letting poor people suffer. No comprehensive relief mechanism on part of the government is still visible to help relieve the homeless and the poor of the cold and cold-related illnesses. Hundreds of thousands of poor people are faced with cold, which will only intensify in the days to come. People in the north, home to hundreds of thousands of people living below the poverty line, are hit the hardest. The northern districts have already seen a decline in temperature. In several northern districts, temperatures hovered around 12–14°C. Residents and local representatives say that there has been no relief distribution yet among the poor, leaving them vulnerable. The authorities should, therefore, step up efforts to help patients with cold-related diseases and enhance the capabilities of the hospitals, especially public, to deliver proper treatment for an increasing number of patients. Awareness among people of how to deal with cold spells can also help them better prepare and take care of themselves. The government should also attend to air pollution, which worsens the impact of cold-related diseases. The government should also undertake an early relief programme to help people in poverty fight the cold weather.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/252479/hospitals-need-to-step-up-efforts-to-treat-cold-related-diseases
"Govt should make United Power pay legal gas prices, review deal","UNITED Power Generation and Distribution Co Ltd, which owns two commercial independent power plants, set up with a combined capacity of 164MW in 2008 and 2009 that supply power to the export processing zones in Dhaka and Chattogram, is reported to have been raking up an abnormal amount of money in profit, more so since 2018, when it began to pay less for the gas it buys for its plants from Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Co Ltd. Paying less for years since January 2018, the power company has owed Titas Tk 4.86 billion by October 2024. This is believed to have been possible as the company owner had been close to the government of the Awami League, which assumed office in 2009 and was toppled in a mass uprising on August 5. The company, which produces power commercially, was not meant to receive gas in view of the 2008 policy to enhance private sector participation in the power sector. United Power, which has made 50–74 per cent profit over the past decade, bought gas for Tk 9.88 billion between 2017–2018 and 2023–2024 and earned Tk 37.99 billion from its sales of power. Experts view the incident as a tell-tale sign of the Awami League’s favouritism. The company has also been named a group favoured by the Awami League in the white paper on the state of the Bangladesh economy, which a government committee instituted on August 29 submitted on December 1, noting that the company had received special terms. The company receives gas at the purchase rate applicable to independent power plant, which is lower than the purchase rate applicable to captive and commercial power plants. The company had signed a deal with Titas to buy gas at the captive rate a year before it obtained the licence in October 2009. The company buys gas at the independent power plant rate of Tk 15.75 a cubic metre instead of the captive rate of Tk 30.75 a cubic metre. In 2009, the difference in gas prices for independent power plants and captive power plants was Tk 1.12 a unit, which has now increased to Tk 15 a unit. United Power kept paying for the gas at the independent power plant rate after it had obtained licence until August 2022, when the High Court ruled that the company should pay at the captive plant rate for the gas it uses for commercial power and at the independent plant rate for the gas it uses for power sold to the government. The High Court order came after a legal battle triggered by Titas asking for separate rates in 2019. United Power’s outstanding bills from paying less stood at Tk 3.77 billion in 2022, the company agreed in December that year agreed to pay back the dues in 40 instalments, but only one instalment, Tk 300 million, has so far been paid. The government should, in such a situation, make United Power pay back the bills outstanding to Titas Gas and review the licence.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/252478/govt-should-make-united-power-pay-legal-gas-prices-review-deal
