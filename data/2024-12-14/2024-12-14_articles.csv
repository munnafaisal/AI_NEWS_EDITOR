England fight back on opening day of third NZ Test,"New Zealand failed to capitalise on a rock-steady start to reach 315-9 on day one of the third and final Test against England in Hamilton on Saturday. Led by seamers Matthew Potts and Gus Atkinson, the tourists fought back with the ball after openers Tom Latham (63) and Will Young (42) put on 105 for the opening stand. However, the hard early work was undone by a flurry of loose shots in the afternoon as six wickets fell for 89 runs at Seddon Park. Late hitting from Mitchell Santner handed the momentum back to the home side, including a straight six off the day’s final ball to raise a half-century. Santner will resume on 50 not out, alongside the scoreless Will O’Rourke. England’s goal of completing a 3-0 series clean sweep was kept alive by some disciplined seam bowling after putting the Black Caps in to bat. Potts (3-75) impressed by removing top-scorer Latham and danger man Kane Williamson (44) to celebrate his recall at the expense of Chris Woakes. The 26-year-old said England had ‘wrestled’ their way back into the game after going wicket-less in the first session. ‘In this group the character’s real strong,’ Potts said. ‘I think if you notice, there’s periods where we do go through a phase of not taking any wickets and we know that if we do stick to our guns and we are meticulous with it, that it will come our way eventually.’ Atkinson (3-55) took his career tally to 51 wickets, second only to Australian seamer Terry Alderman’s 54 wickets in 1981 for the most Test scalps in a debut year. Atkinson was among those to benefit from New Zealand’s reckless middle-order batting. Rachin Ravindra (18), Daryl Mitchell (14), Tom Blundell (21) and Glenn Phillips (5) were all caught by fielders on the off-side when failing to keep the ball down. It reflected a do-or-die approach, with 228 runs -- or 72 percent of their total -- coming through boundaries. Latham and Young belatedly unearthed the kind of batting resolve largely missing in big losses in Christchurch and Wellington that had put the hosts down 2-0 in the series. Young fell for his lunch score, caught smartly at second slip by Harry Brook off Atkinson, before Latham edged down the leg side off Potts soon afterwards. It ended the best opening stand of the seam-dominated series from either team, surpassing the previous best of 18. The key wicket of Williamson fell soon after tea, playing on in agonising fashion when he failed to kick the ball clear as it ballooned onto his stumps -- prompting a feeling of ‘pure elation’ for Potts. Veteran bowler Tim Southee, playing his 107th and final Test, delighted supporters at his home ground with a whirlwind 23 off 10 balls. The 36-year-old bowler struck three sixes to take his career tally to 98 and closer to becoming the fourth player to clear the ropes 100 times in Tests. Santner said he and Southee deliberately adopted a free-wheeling approach, believing it best suited a pitch offering variable bounce. ‘I think Tom and Will did an outstanding job before lunch and I think credit to England, they actually stuck in it for a long time and bowled good areas,’ said Santner, whose spin could prove important later in the Test. ‘There’s still enough in the wicket, and a little bit of probably uneven bounce.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252837/england-fight-back-on-opening-day-of-third-nz-test
Manchester derby brings sleepless nights for Guardiola,"Riddled with anxiety about Manchester City’s shocking decline, Pep Guardiola will endure another sleepless night as he tries to pose more problems for Ruben Amorim in the Manchester United manager’s first taste of the Premier League’s most explosive rivalry. For the first time in years, City go into the Manchester derby mired in even more turmoil than United after a dismal run of one win in 10 games in all competitions. Wednesday’s 2-0 Champions League defeat at Juventus was City’s seventh loss in that period, an astonishing collapse for a club that has won six of the last seven Premier League titles, including their current streak of four in a row. United are hardly in peak form themselves, having won just three of Amorim’s six games in charge since he replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag. But Amorim has already inflicted one painful blow to Guardiola this season when his Sporting side crushed City 4-1 in the Champions League in Lisbon on November 5. City squandered an early lead on that occasion, blown away by Viktor Gyokeres’ hat-trick as Amorim ruthlessly exposed the gaping holes in Guardiola’s ramshackle defence. That chastening loss came just days before Amorim officially took charge at Old Trafford and Guardiola would love to exact avenge at the Etihad Stadium this weekend. Whether Guardiola’s injury-plagued team, whose confidence appears to be in tatters, are in any shape to deliver a sixth win in their last seven league meetings with United is another matter. The strain of the worst run of his glittering managerial career is taking a toll on Guardiola as well. In an interview before the Juventus game, Guardiola said his state of mind was ‘ugly’, his sleep was ‘worse’ and he was eating lighter as his digestion has suffered during City’s collapse. On Friday, Guardiola, who recently signed a new two-year contract, insisted he was ‘fine’ despite the stress. ‘In our jobs we always want to do our best. When that doesn’t happen you are more uncomfortable than when the situation is going well,’ said Guardiola, who could have just three fit defenders available on Sunday. ‘In good moments I am happier but when I get to the next game I am still concerned about what I have to do. ‘There is no human being that makes an activity and it doesn’t matter how they do.’ There is no question another loss to Amorim would be a huge blow for Guardiola, whose fourth-placed side are eight points behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand. Yet Amorim has plenty of issues of his own to resolve after a rocky first month in Manchester featuring only one league victory in four matches. United are languishing in 13th place after successive league losses to Arsenal and Nottingham Forest underlined the extent of the rebuilding job faced by Amorim. They struggled to find any fluency in a nervy 2-1 victory at minnows Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League on Thursday. Given United’s mediocrity before and since his arrival, Amorim is in no position to cast aspersions about City’s woes. ‘I never think about these things. We will face a great opponent and I’m more focused on our problems, so we have a lot of issues here,’ he said. ‘I’m more focused on what we should do on Sunday to win the game, so I’m really focused on my team.’ And the 39-year-old believes City are capable of hitting back if United allow them to rediscover their rhythm amid the sound and fury of the derby. ‘The great teams can respond in any moment. I think they are in a better place than us in the type of understanding the game,’ he said. ‘The way they play, the confidence they have. Even in these kind of moments.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/252836/manchester-derby-brings-sleepless-nights-for-guardiola
MSC beat Abahani to take top spot,"Malian forward Souleymane Diabate scored the match-winning goal as Mohammedan Sporting Club thumped archrivals Abahani Limited with a 1-0 victory in the first leg of the Bangladesh Premier League at the Shaheed Dhirendhranath Datta Stadium in Cumilla on Saturday. Diabate scored the decisive goal for a 1-0 win over holders Bashundhara Kings in their previous match in Dhaka, fired Abahani’s net with a close-range header in the stoppage time of the first half. With his fourth goal in three matches, Diabate shared the top scorer spot with Police Football Club forward Al-Amin, and pushed Mohammedan to the top of the 10-team table from second place with nine points. Mohammedan made a flying start in the league with a crushing 6-0 win over promoted Dhaka Wanderers when Diabate scored a brace. The foreign player-less Abahani suffered the first defeat in the league and slipped to fifth place from third with six points from three outings. The Sky Blues beat Chittagong Abahani 3-0 after a 2-0 win over another promoted side Fakirerpool Young Man’s Club in their other games. Abahani’s forward Arman Foysal Akash was denied by the woodwork once, just before he struck an equaliser in the stoppage time after the stipulated time but it was ruled out due to offside. Meanwhile, Kings returned to their winning ways after handing the first defeat to Rahmatganj Muslim Friends Society 4-1 in the other day’s match at the Kings Arena. Brazilian midfielder Jonathan Fernandes (10th) opened the account for Kings while Rahmatganj’s forward Nabib Newaz Jibon (12th) restored the parity. Kings another Brazilian midfielder Miguel Ferreira converted a spot kick in the stoppage time of the first half while midfielder Sohel Rana (53rd) and defender Topu Barman (76th) added once each.

Shanto’s comeback innings goes in vain,"Najmul Hossain Shanto’s impressive comeback innings of 80 off 54 went in vain as Barishal stunned Rajshahi by chasing down 184 runs during the third round of the NCL T20 at the outer ground of the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium on Saturday. National team captain Shanto, who was playing his first competitive match after missing out on the ongoing West Indies tour due to injury, along with Habibur Rahman (47 off 33) and Sabbir Hosan (23 off 11), helped Rajshahi to post a challenging total after sent to bat first. In reply, Barishal openers Abdul Mazid (53 off 39), Iftakhar Hossain (35 off 24) and Fazle Mahmud (56 off 34) laid a solid foundation. Then, Salman Hossain (21 off 12) and Moin Khan (15 off 8) took them off the mark with three balls to spare. At the main ground in the morning, Dhaka suffered a crushing defeat by 10 wickets to Chattogram after skittled out for just 64. Left-arm pacer Fahad Hossain took four for 11 runs, while Ifran Hossain, Ahmed Sharif, and Mahmudul Hasan took two wickets apiece. Chattogram openers Mahmudul Hasan Joy and Tamim Iqbal got them home in 11 overs with all the wickets unscathed. In the afternoon, the reigning longer version NCL champions Sylhet suffered their third consecutive defeat as they got outplayed by five wickets against Rangpur at the main ground. Batting first, Sylhet managed only 120-6 after Tofael Ahmed hit 51 off 38 while batting at seven. Rangpur’s duo of veteran Naeem Islam (50 off 35) and young gun Abdullah Al Mamun (29 off 12) got them to their third consecutive win with 26 balls. At the outer ground, Khulna fell short of six runs while chasing Dhaka Metro’s 146 runs in an 18-over contest. Metro opener Imranuzzaman top-scored with 46 off 28 while Khulna pacer Mehedi Hasan Rana took 3 for 25. In the chase, Khulna kept losing wickets regularly. The Bangladesh U-19 team captain, Azizul Hakim, top-scored with 29 from 17, but other than him, none could make any substantial contribution. Metro’s off-spinner Aliss Al Islam took three for 24.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252834/shantos-comeback-innings-goes-in-vain
Bangladesh look to capitalise on batters’ form in T20Is,"Bangladesh are eyeing to capitalize on the batters’ form from the recently concluded ODI series, despite suffering a 3-0 defeat against the West Indies, as the battle of T20Is begins on Monday. The first of the three-match series is scheduled to begin at 6:00am Bangladesh Standard Time at the Kingstown in St Vincent. It’s been a mixed tour for Bangladesh so far, as they made a comeback to draw the Test series 1-1 by securing a 101-run win in the second Test in Jamaica after suffering a defeat in the first Test in Antigua by 201 runs. But then the Tigers were swept by the hosts in ODIs—the format that often seemed to be their favorite. They had been on a winning streak of 11 matches in the format before losing the first ODI against West Indies by five wickets. Bangladesh suffered defeats in the second and third ODIs by a seven-wicket and a four-wicket respectively. Bangladesh batters displayed batting prowess by scoring 294 in the first ODI and 321 in the third match. As they prepare for the upcoming T20 series, Soumya Sarkar stated that the batters’ current form would be helpful. ‘We have been playing well in the ODIs. But we didn’t have a good couple of series. However, batters have scored 300 runs. This is a positive sign,’ Soumya said in a BCB video. The bowlers, though, came under scrutiny after failing to defend two big totals. Soumya, who last played in the format in the last World Cup, hoped that they would make a comeback in the 20-over series. ‘The bowlers might’ve struggled in the [ODI] series a bit. I hope they will come back in the T20 series,’ he said. ‘And if the batters continue to maintain the consistency and the batters do something good, then we can hope for something good,’ he added. However, it won’t be easy for Bangladesh, as they are struggling in this format, having lost six of their last T20 matches. Bangladesh’s last T20 victory against the West Indies was about six years ago. Since then, they have suffered four consecutive losses to the Caribbean. West Indies, however, aren’t on top of their game either. They lost to England at home by 3-1 before losing to Sri Lanka away by 2-1. Soumya said that whatever the difference between the two teams, it won’t matter in the series. ‘The thing is, it’s a game of 40 overs. The big teams and small teams, it won’t matter. If we can do well in the three departments, then we can hope that we can beat them comfortably,’ said Soumya. Bangladesh will see a new captain Liton Das in the series after Mehidy Hasan Miraz led them in the absence of injured captain Najmul Hossain Shanto. Bangladesh also recalled all-rounder Shamim Hossain and Afif Hossain, whereas pacer Ripon Mondol has been called into the senior side for the first time after playing in the Asian Games 2023. The venue also holds some bitter memories for Bangladesh. It was where that they missed a golden opportunity to reach the semifinals of the T20 World Cup, suffering a crushing defeat against Afghanistan in June.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252833/bangladesh-look-to-capitalise-on-batters-form-in-t20is
Georgia ruling party installs loyalist president,"Georgia’s ruling party on Saturday installed a far-right loyalist as president in a controversial election process, amid a deepening constitutional crisis and weeks of mass pro-EU protests. The Black Sea nation has been in turmoil since the governing Georgian Dream party claimed victory in contested October parliamentary elections. Its decision last month to delay European Union membership talks ignited a fresh wave of mass rallies. An electoral college, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party and boycotted by the opposition, elected Mikheil Kavelashvili with 224 votes as the country’s next figurehead leader for a five-year term, central election commission chair Giorgi Kalandarishvili said. The opposition has denounced Saturday’s election as ‘illegitimate’ and said the sitting president, Salome Zurabishvili remains the country’s sole legitimate leader. Pro-Western Zurabishvili—who is at loggerheads with Georgian Dream—has refused to step down and is demanding new parliamentary elections, paving the way for a constitutional showdown. On Saturday morning, protesters began gathering outside the parliament building—which was cordoned off by police—ahead of a rally scheduled for the evening. Demonstrators shared tea to keep warm on a frosty morning, with water cannons parked nearby, an AFP reporter witnessed. ‘Georgia never loses its sense of humour, celebrating the election of a footballer as president,’ Zurabishvili wrote on social media. She shared video footage of protesters playing football in the snow in a clear jab at Kavelashvili. One of the protesters, 40-year-old Natia Apkhazava, said she arrived early ‘to protect our European future’. ‘Our (parliamentary) election was rigged. We need new elections,’ she said. ‘We have been protesting here for 16 days... and we’ll keep fighting for our European future.’ Protests are scheduled to take place at around a dozen locations in Tbilisi. Thousands of pro-EU demonstrators filled the streets of the capital on Friday, before gathering outside parliament for the 16th consecutive day. A former diplomat, Zurabishvili is a hugely popular figure among protesters, who view her as a beacon of Georgia’s European aspirations. Ahead of Saturday’s vote, Zurabishvili called it ‘a parody. It will be an event entirely devoid of legitimacy, unconstitutional and illegitimate,’ she told a press conference. Opposition groups accuse Georgian Dream of rigging the October 26 parliamentary vote, backsliding on democracy and moving Tbilisi closer to Russia—all at the expense of the Caucasus nation’s constitutionally mandated bid to join the European Union. Kavelashvili, 53 -- the sole candidate for the largely ceremonial presidential post—is known for his vehement anti-West diatribes and opposition to LGBTQ rights. Georgian Dream scrapped direct presidential elections in 2017. With Zurabishvili refusing to leave office, opposition lawmakers boycotting parliament, and protests showing no signs of abating, the legitimacy of Kavelashvili’s election has been undermined from the outset. One author of Georgia’s constitution, Vakhtang Khmaladze, has argued that all decisions by the new parliament are void. This is because it ratified the mandates of newly elected lawmakers before a court issued a ruling on a legal bid to contest the elections filed by the incumbent president, he explained. ‘Georgia is facing an unprecedented constitutional crisis,’ Khmaladze told AFP. It remains unclear how the government will react if Zurabishvili refuses to step down after her successor is inaugurated on December 29. Police have fired tear gas and water cannons during more than two weeks of demonstrations and arrested more than 400 protesters, according to the Social Justice Centre, an NGO. On Friday, Amnesty International said protesters had faced ‘brutal dispersal tactics, arbitrary detention and torture’. There have also been raids on the offices of opposition parties and arrests of their leaders. As international condemnation of the police crackdown mounted, French President Emmanuel Macron told Georgians their ‘European dream must not be extinguished’. ‘We are by your side in supporting your European and democratic aspirations,’ he said in a video address. Earlier this week, Macron made a phone call to Georgian Dream founder Bidzina Ivanishvili—the tycoon widely considered to be Georgia’s real power broker. His decision to call Ivanishvili—rather than Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze—is indicative of the West’s hesitancy to recognise the legitimacy of Georgian Dream’s new government. Washington has also imposed fresh sanctions on Georgian officials, barring entry for around 20 people accused of ‘undermining democracy in Georgia’, including ministers and parliamentarians.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252832/georgia-ruling-party-installs-loyalist-president
Iran confirms increase in IAEA nuclear inspections,"Iran confirmed Saturday that it has allowed watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to increase the number of inspections it carries out into Tehran’s nuclear programme, state media reported. ‘We have increased capacity—it is natural that the number of inspections should also increase,’ the official IRNA news agency quoted the country’s nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami as saying. ‘When we carry out nuclear activities, and where we deal with nuclear materials, changing the scale will naturally change the monitoring level,’ he added. Eslami’s comments came after an IAEA report, seen by AFP on Friday, that Iran had agreed to increased monitoring. ‘Iran agreed to the agency’s request to increase the frequency and intensity of the implementation of safeguards measures at Fordo enrichment plant’ south of Tehran, the IAEA report said. Last week the UN nuclear watchdog said Iran had revamped Fordo so it could ‘significantly increase the rate of production of uranium enriched up to 60 percent’, close to the 90 percent needed to make a nuclear weapon. Iran insists on its right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, and denies it is seeking an atomic weapons capability. ‘The IAEA has always had access to monitor within the framework of the safeguard agreement and the NPT, and we have not created any obstacles for it and we will not do so,’ Eslami said. The Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT requires member states to declare and maintain their nuclear materials under IAEA supervision. Last month, Iran announced it would launch ‘new and advanced’ centrifuges in response to an IAEA board resolution censuring Tehran for what it called a lack of cooperation with the agency. Britain, France and Germany on Tuesday ‘condemned’ Tehran’s latest steps to expand its nuclear programme, ‘strongly urging’ it to reverse them. In a letter to the UN Security Council, the three European powers raised the possibility of restoring all UN sanctions against Iran to keep it from developing its nuclear programme. Nuclear tensions with the West have soared since Donald Trump withdrew from a landmark 2015 deal with Tehran during his first term as US president. The deal had provided sanctions relief in exchange for limits on Iran’s nuclear programme.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252831/iran-confirms-increase-in-iaea-nuclear-inspections
Brazil ex-defense minister arrested over coup plot,"Brazilian authorities on Saturday arrested Braga Netto, a former defense minister and close ally of ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, on suspicion of obstructing an investigation into an alleged coup attempt in 2022, a police source told AFP. Brazil’s Federal Police said it had detained ‘people who would be obstructing’ the investigation. ‘Braga Netto was arrested in the operation,’ the source said. In late November, police released a report recommending the indictment of former far-right president Bolsonaro and several dozen allies for attempting a coup d’état to prevent the inauguration of leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The list included Netto, who was also his running mate in the 2022 elections. Attorney general Paulo Gonet has been examining the allegations to see if evidence supports charges being laid against Bolsonaro and the 36 others named as co-conspirators. The 884-page report drawn up after a nearly two-year police investigation urges Gonet to indict Bolsonaro and the others for planning an attempted coup and seeking to ‘violently overthrow the democratic state.’ It details alleged collusion between Bolsonaro and some of his officials, including members of his military brass, to claim fraud in the 2022 elections won by Lula and to use decrees to sideline the Supreme Court. ‘The then-President of the Republic, Jair Bolsonaro, actively participated in the creation of the coup plan, being directly involved in the drafting of documents and strategies to remain in power, even after the electoral defeat,’ the report said. Bolsonaro was also ‘fully aware’ of an alleged plan by elite soldiers to assassinate Lula, his vice president and a Supreme Court judge, said the report. The plan, called ‘Green and Yellow Dagger,’ was allegedly discussed at Netto’s home. It was printed at the Planalto palace, the seat of the Brazilian presidency, according to investigators. A draft of the coup plan was found at the headquarters of Bolsonaro’s Liberal Party among the belongings of one of Netto’s advisors.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/latin-america/252830/brazil-ex-defense-minister-arrested-over-coup-plot
Five dead as migrant boat sinks off Greece,"Five migrants died early Saturday when a migrant boat sank off Crete, Greece’s coastguard said, leaving 40 people reportedly missing while 39 survivors were rescued. The boat sank 12 nautical miles southwest of the island, according to ERTNEWS, which reported the 40 missing. A huge rescue operation involving vessels and aircraft was under way in the sea south of the island of Gavdos, south of Crete, after the boat capsized shortly after midnight, the coastguard said. The first dead was found Saturday morning. Local media said another man was taken by helicopter to hospital in the city of Chania on Crete and was admitted to intensive care. Saturday afternoon, the coastguard told AFP that the number of migrants found dead had risen to five. Greece has seen a 25-per cent increase this year in the number of migrants arriving, with a 30-percent increase to Rhodes and the southeast Aegean, according to the migration ministry. Several similar accidents have occurred in recent weeks. In late November, eight migrants, six of them minors, died north of the island of Samos, on a route frequently used by people smugglers.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252829/five-dead-as-migrant-boat-sinks-off-greece
"Bomb kills three at Thai festival, 2 held","Authorities in Thailand have arrested two men following a bomb blast at a festival near the border with Myanmar that killed three people and wounded dozens, police said on Saturday. An improvised explosive device went off on a dance floor at a festival in Umphang district in Thailand’s northern Tak province on Friday night, according to local police. Two people were killed instantly and another died later in hospital, police said. The explosion also injured 48 people among approximately 8,000-9,000 attending the event. Thai police said they had arrested a Thai youth and a man they said was a member of the Karen National Union (KNU), an ethnic minority rebel group that has fought the Myanmar military for decades for autonomy in neighbouring Myanmar’s Karen state. Tak police chief Major-General Samrit Ekamol said the Myanmar suspect had thrown the bomb after encountering a ‘rival gangster’ he had previously fought with. A senior KNU official contacted by AFP, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to media, denied any involvement and said the group did not have any members in the area. The KNU can call on more than 5,000 fighters, maintains close links with Thai police and military, and has extensive business interests on both sides of the border, according to analysts. Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra expressed her condolences to the victims and their families, and urged security agencies to carry out an investigation.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/252828/bomb-kills-three-at-thai-festival-2-held
World falls short of drought deal at Riyadh talks,"Negotiators failed to produce an agreement on how to respond to drought at Saudi-hosted UN talks, participants said on Saturday, falling short of a hoped-for binding protocol addressing the scourge. The 12-day meeting of parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), known as COP16, concluded early on Saturday morning, a day later than scheduled as parties tried to hammer out a deal. Prior to the talks, UNCCD Executive Secretary Ibrahim Thiaw said the world expected negotiators ‘to adopt a bold decision that can help turn the tide on the most pervasive and the most disruptive environmental disaster: drought’. But addressing the plenary session before dawn, Thiaw acknowledged that ‘parties need more time to agree on the best way forward’. A press release on Saturday said the parties -- 196 countries and the European Union—had ‘made significant progress in laying the groundwork for a future global drought regime, which they intend to complete at COP17 in Mongolia in 2026’. The Riyadh talks came after the partial failure of biodiversity talks in Colombia, the failure to reach a UN deal on plastics pollution in South Korea, and a climate finance deal that disappointed developing nations at COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan. Droughts ‘fuelled by human destruction of the environment’ cost the world more than $300 billion each year, the UN said in a report published on December 3, the second day of the talks in Riyadh. Droughts are projected to affect 75 percent of the world’s population by 2050, it said. A delegate at COP16 from a country in Africa, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations, told AFP that African nations had hoped the talks would produce a binding protocol on drought. That would ensure ‘every government will be held responsible’ for devising stronger preparation and response plans, the delegate said. ‘It’s the first time I’ve seen Africa so united, with a strong united front, with respect to the drought protocol.’ Two other COP16 participants, also requesting anonymity, told AFP that developed countries did not want a binding protocol and instead were pushing for a ‘framework’, which African countries deemed inadequate. Indigenous groups were also pushing for a protocol, said Praveena Sridhar, chief technical officer for Save Soil, a global campaign backed by UN agencies. This would allow for better monitoring, early warning systems and response plans, she said. Yet the absence of a protocol from COP16 ‘shouldn’t delay progress’, as national governments can still allocate ‘budgets and subsidies to financially support farmers in adopting sustainable soil and land management’. Ahead of the Riyadh talks, the UNCCD said 1.5 billion hectares (3.7 billion acres) of land must be restored by decade’s end and that at least $2.6 trillion in global investments was needed. The first week saw pledges of more than $12 billion from bodies such as the Arab Coordination Group, a collection of national and regional institutions, and the Riyadh Global Drought Resilience Partnership, which is meant to mobilise public and private money to help at-risk countries. Activists accused Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, of trying to water down calls to phase out fossil fuels at last month’s COP29 UN climate talks in Baku. However, desertification is a major issue for the Gulf kingdom. Along with the drought resilience partnership, Saudi Arabia launched initiatives to promote early warning for sand and dust storms and to get the private sector involved in land preservation, Saudi Environment Minister Abdulrahman AlFadley said in his closing remarks. Saudi Arabia is dedicated ‘to working with all parties to preserve ecosystems, enhance international cooperation to combat desertification and land degradation, and address drought’, he said. Sridhar of Save Soil said Saudi Arabia had succeeded in raising the profile of land-related issues, which she described as more ‘unifying’ than the climate talks in Baku. ‘Attending to land, agriculture lands, farmers, livestock—it’s not a contested subject. Nobody’s going to say ‘I don’t want food’,’ she said. ‘The use of fossil fuels or not is a very polarising subject. This is not.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252827/world-falls-short-of-drought-deal-at-riyadh-talks
Dutch court rules against ban on arms exports to Israel,"A Dutch court on Friday rejected demands by pro-Palestinian groups for a ban on arms exports from the Netherlands to Israel. The non-governmental groups had accused Israel of conducting a ‘genocide’ in its war in Gaza. But the court said the Dutch government was respecting rules governing the country’s arms trade. ‘The state should not be forced to impose a ban on exporting goods that can be used for military means,’ the court in The Hague said in a statement. The pro-Palestinian groups said in a statement they had expected the decision but still called it a ‘blow’ to international justice. They said they may appeal. The groups had said that Israel’s actions in Gaza and the occupied West Bank since the Hamas group’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel had put it in breach of the 1948 UN genocide convention. Zainah El-Haroun, spokesperson for the NGO Al-Haq said that the Netherlands, as the venue for the International Court of Justice and other international tribunals, had to act to ‘prevent genocide’. The court said the government had carried out its obligations to assess the risk that arms exported to Israel are not used ‘in a way that could lead to a breach of humanitarian law in war.’ It highlighted a case where a military goods export to Israel had been halted.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252826/dutch-court-rules-against-ban-on-arms-exports-to-israel

US starts relocating Marines from Okinawa,"The United States has begun relocating thousands of Marines from the Japanese island of Okinawa, Tokyo and Washington said Saturday, after decades of mounting grievances among locals over America’s military presence. In 2012, the United States said it would redeploy 9,000 Marines from the island where communities complain bases are an unfair burden—with objections ranging from pollution to noise and helicopter crashes. The relocation began with ‘a small detachment of approximately 100 logistics support Marines’ transferred to the US island territory of Guam, Japan’s defence ministry and the US Marine Corps said. ‘Commencement of relocation to Guam signifies the first phase of relocating Marines to locations outside of Japan,’ said the joint statement. There are currently around 19,000 Marines in Okinawa—strategically located east of Taiwan, which has become a flashpoint for tensions between the United States and China. Beijing claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to bring the self-ruled island under its control. Washington is Taiwan’s most important backer and biggest supplier of arms, but has long maintained ‘strategic ambiguity’ about the prospect of backing it with boots on the ground. The 9,000 relocating Marines are set to be moved elsewhere in the Pacific—to Guam, Hawaii or Australia, the United States has said. Okinawa comprises just 0.6 percent of Japan’s territory but hosts more than half of the 50,000 US troops posted in the country. The 1995 gang rape of a 12-year-old girl by three US soldiers in Okinawa also prompted widespread backlash, with calls for a rethink of the 1960 pact allowing the United States to post soldiers in Japan.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/252824/us-starts-relocating-marines-from-okinawa
Israel continues strike on Syria military sites,"A Syria war monitor said Israel launched strikes early Saturday targeting military sites in Damascus and its countryside, in the latest such raids since rebels brought down Bashar al-Assad almost a week ago. ‘Israeli strikes destroyed a scientific institute’ and other related military facilities in Barzeh, in northern Damascus, and targeted a ‘military airport’ in the capital’s countryside, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Strikes also targeted ‘Scud ballistic missile warehouses’ and launchers in the Qalamun area, as well as ‘rockets, depots and tunnels under the mountain’, according to the Britain-based Observatory, which has a network of sources inside Syria. The Observatory said several rounds of bombardment targeted ‘military sites of the former regime forces, as part of destroying what is left of the future Syrian army’s capabilities’. Israel air strikes on Friday targeted ‘a missile base at the top of Damascus’s Mount Qasyun’, the group said, as well as an airport in southern Sweida province and ‘defence and research labs in Masyaf’, in Hama province. Since Assad’s fall, Israel has launched hundreds of strikes against Syrian military sites, targeting everything from chemical weapons stores to air defences. In a move that has drawn international condemnation, Israel also seized a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone on the Syrian Golan Heights just hours after the rebels, led by Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, took Damascus. On Thursday, UN chief Antonio Guterres expressed concern over ‘extensive violations’ of Syrian sovereignty and the Israeli strikes in the country, his spokesman said. Turkey said it had urged Russia and Iran not to intervene militarily to support Bashar al-Assad’s forces as Islamist-led rebels mounted their lightning advance on Damascus that ended with the Syrian strongman’s ouster. ‘The most important thing was to talk to the Russians and Iranians to ensure that they didn’t enter the equation militarily. We had meetings with (them) and they understood,’ Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told Turkey’s private NTV television. He said if Moscow and Tehran, both key Assad allies since the start of the civil war in 2011, had come to the Syrian president’s aid, the rebels could still have won but the outcome could have been far more violent. ‘If Assad had received support, the opposition could have achieved victory with their determination, but it would have taken a long time and could have been bloody,’ he said. Turkey’s aim was to ‘hold focused talks with the two important power players to ensure minimum loss of life,’ Fidan said. When the Islamist-led HTS rebel alliance first began its offensive on November 27, Moscow and Tehran initially offered Assad military support to hold off the rebels. But the scale of the collapse of Assad’s forces took them by surprise. And it came at a time when both nations were caught up with problems of their own: Russia mired in the war with Ukraine, and Iran’s proxies including Lebanon’s Hezbollah taking a major battering from Israel. They quickly realised the game was up, that Assad ‘was no longer someone to invest in’ and ‘there was no point anymore’, the Turkish minister added. Turkey expressed support for the rebels with experts saying it even gave its green light for the offensive by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), without being directly involved. Many nations, especially in the region, have expressed concern about HTS, which is rooted in Al-Qaeda’s former Syria branch and proscribed by many Western governments as a terror organisation. But Fidan said it was ‘perfectly normal’ to have such concerns about HTS, which would ‘need to be resolved’. ‘No one knows them as well as we do, we want a Syria without terrorism, not posing a threat to the countries in the region.’ Since 2016, Turkey has held considerable sway over northwestern Syria, maintaining a working relationship with HTS which ran most of the Idlib area, which was Syria’s last bastion of opposition. With open lines of communication with HTS, Turkey was relaying such concerns directly to them, he said. ‘We reflect our friends’ concerns to them and ensure they take steps. They have made many announcements and people see they are on the right track,’ he said. The message that Ankara was sending to the new administration in Damascus was: ‘This is what Turkey—which has stood by you for years—expects. And this is what the world expects,’ he said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252823/israel-continues-strike-on-syria-military-sites

Dhaka stocks lose steam in past week,"Dhaka stocks witnessed a big drop in its indices in the past week, after increasing slightly in the previous week, as a section of panic-driven investors sold shares to protect their funds, market operators said. They said that lack of investor confidence, consistent market volatility and heightened uncertainty about the market led to the negative vibe. DSEX, the key index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, decreased by 91.39 points, or 1.76 per cent, in the past week to end at 5,105.43 points. Investors were cautious as the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission recently imposed huge amount of fines on several individual investors and entities on allegations of share price manipulation and violation of securities laws, the market operators said. Also, higher bank interest rates are inspiring investors to invest in fixed-income options instead of the stock market, they said. The daily average turnover on the DSE decreased in the past week to reach Tk 322.18 crore compared with that of Tk 444.34 crore in the previous week. Of the 392 issues traded in the past week, 76 increased, 293 decreased and 23 stayed the same. Investors were mostly active in pharmaceutical scrips, followed by textile and bank shares. EBL Securities in its weekly market commentary said, ‘Investors became anxious over the market’s momentum amid repeated regulatory actions against stock manipulations.’ ‘The market witnessed a continuous selling spree throughout the week, while the news of the disbursement of the Tk 3000 crore sovereign-guaranteed loan to ICB also failed to subside the prevailing pessimism, leading the bears to take control of the market momentum,’ it added. The DS30 index decreased by 30.02 points, or 1.57 per cent, to finish at 1,881.90 points. The DSE Shariah index lost 23.92 points, or 2.06 per cent, to close at 1,140.05 points in the past week. Orion Infusion topped the average weekly turnover chart with shares worth Tk 22.21 crore changing hands per session. Dragon Sweater and Spinning, Asiatic Laboratories, Taufika Foods and Lovello Ice-cream, Saiham Cotton Mills, NRB Bank, Beximco Pharmaceuticals, Bangladesh Shipping Corporation and Square Pharmaceuticals were the other turnover leaders.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/stocks/252820/dhaka-stocks-lose-steam-in-past-week

"China’s Baidu, Geely say ‘huge changes’ in EV landscape behind cuts","Chinese tech titan Baidu and car giant Geely on Friday blamed ‘huge changes’ in the EV industry for sudden staffing and operations cuts at their joint electric auto venture this week. ‘Due to huge changes in the industry’s competitive landscape, the established business plan could not be executed and operations have encountered challenges,’ the companies said in a joint statement shared to their official social media accounts. Jiyue, the EV project backed by Baidu and Geely, this week told employees it was disbanding some departments, angering staff, according to local media reports. It was unclear how many employees would be affected, but Baidu and Geely vowed to help resolve payment issues ‘as soon as possible’. China is the biggest electric vehicle market in the world, but plans by Chinese automotive firms to expand overseas have been increasingly threatened by thorny trade disputes between Beijing and Western nations. Jiyue’s struggles could foreshadow challenges ahead for other Chinese EV companies, independent auto analyst Lei Xing told AFP. ‘It just shows how difficult it is to compete in the current environment,’ Lei said. Geely and Baidu are both leading players in their industries, Lei added, so ‘for this to happen is kind of a suprise’. Plus, the ‘debacle’ at Jiyue isn’t likely to be the last, said Lei. ‘I think other brands, as we look into 2025, could be in trouble as well.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/252818/chinas-baidu-geely-say-huge-changes-in-ev-landscape-behind-cuts
German exports fall more than expected in October,"German exports fell more than expected in October as demand from the United States slowed sharply, official data showed Friday, in more bad news for Europe’s biggest economy. Exports slipped 2.8 per cent on the previous month and stood at 124.6 billion euros ($130.3 billion), according to figures from federal statistics agency Destatis. Analysts surveyed by financial data firm FactSet had been expecting a decline of two per cent. Exports to the United States, the top destination for ‘made in Germany’ goods’, plunged 14.2 per cent to 12.2 billion euros. To China, which was Germany’s top trading partner in 2023, exports were down 3.8 per cent to 6.9 billion euros. Exports to other European Union countries also fell but by a more modest 0.7 per cent, according to Destatis. Germany imported 111.2 billion euros of goods in October, down 0.1 per cent on a month earlier, with its trade surplus coming in at 13.4 billion euros. Weak demand for Germany’s crucial exports has been a key driver of a drawn-out slowdown in Europe’s biggest economy, which has also faced high inflation and a host of other deep-rooted challenges. Germany was the only major advanced economy to shrink last year and is on course to contract again in 2024, with most analysts predicting a modest recovery in 2025.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/trade-commerce/252817/german-exports-fall-more-than-expected-in-october
US wholesale prices pick up in Nov,"US producer inflation climbed in November, government data showed Thursday, logging its biggest year-on-year increase since February 2023 as food costs jumped. But on a monthly basis, underlying price increases remained muted when volatile areas such as food, energy and trade services were excluded, the Labour Department report said. The report will be scrutinised for any bearing it may have on the US central bank’s policy meeting next week, with Federal Reserve officials widely expected to lower interest rates again at the end of the gathering. The producer price index (PPI) came in at 0.4 per cent last month, seasonally adjusted, up from 0.3 per cent in October, said the Labour Department. Excluding food, energy and trade services, the index ticked up 0.1 per cent from October to November, down from the prior month’s 0.3 per cent figure. Thursday’s report was hotter than analysts expected. The index for goods rose 0.7 per cent in November, the largest increase since rising 1.1 per cent in February, the agency said. Most of the advance could be traced to food costs, as chicken eggs became more expensive along with some other items. The Fed has been lowering the benchmark lending rate gradually as inflation cooled from painfully high levels in 2022. But policymakers have been cautious to reduce rates too quickly as they monitor progress on inflation. ‘This is not what the Fed and markets were hoping for, but it is a small overshoot that is unlikely to affect the Fed’s judgment about the course of inflation and policy interest rates,’ said High Frequency Economics in a note. It added that ‘policymakers will approach the December rate decision cautiously, keen to avoid having to reverse course at some future date due to unexpected rekindling of inflation.’ On Wednesday, the Labour Department reported that the consumer price index had also risen in November, to 2.7 per cent, the second consecutive month with an increase.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/252816/us-wholesale-prices-pick-up-in-nov
Moody’s downgrades France credit rating to Aa3,"Ratings agency Moody’s downgraded France’s credit rating Saturday to Aa3 with a stable outlook, following months of political crisis and the appointment of centrist Francois Bayrou as prime minister. Moody’s cited France’s ‘political fragmentation’ in its decision, which comes after parliament ousted Michel Barnier’s government in a historic no-confidence vote following a standoff over an austerity budget. ‘The decision to downgrade France’s ratings to Aa3 reflects our view that France’s public finances will be substantially weakened by the country’s political fragmentation which, for the foreseeable future, will constrain the scope and magnitude of measures that could narrow large deficits,’ the ratings agency said in a statement. Bayrou’s appointment makes him France’s fourth prime minister this year, with Barnier being booted out after just three months in office. The newly appointed premier faces the immediate challenge of forming a cabinet that can survive a no-confidence vote in a divided parliament and thrashing out a 2025 budget in a bid to limit economic turmoil. ‘In a highly politically fragmented environment, there is now very low probability that the next government will sustainably reduce the size of fiscal deficits beyond next year,’ Moody’s said. The ratings agency opened the door to downgrading France in October, when it changed the country’s outlook from stable to negative.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/252815/moodys-downgrades-france-credit-rating-to-aa3

"Commission finds involvement of Hasina in enforced disappearance, recommends disbanding of RAB","The Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearance on Saturday in its first interim report found prima facie involvement of the deposed prime minister Sheikh Haisna and some high-ranking officials of security forces and her government, including her defence adviser retired Major General Tarique Ahmed Siddique in enforced disappearances. - Ousted PM Hasina, high ranking officials of security forces involved- 1,676 complaints of enforced disappearances- Estimated enforced disappearances to cross 3,500- 758 complaints scrutinised, 77pc reappeared alive, 23pc still missing- Disbanding of RAB recommended- Next report likely in March The five-member commission led by Justice Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury submitted the report titled ‘Unfolding the truth’ to chief adviser Professor Muhamofmad Yunus at the state guest house Jamuna in the capital on Saturday, said a press release of the chief adviser’s press wing. The commission recommended disbanding the Rapid Action Battalion, the release said. The commission also found involvement of former National Telecommunication Monitoring Centre director general and sacked Major General Ziaul Ahsan, senior police officers, including former Special Branch chief Monirul Islam and former Dhaka Metropolitan Police detective branch chief Md Harun-Or-Rashid, in several incidents of enforced disappearance. ‘We have found the primary involvement of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina from witness statements,’ commission member and BRAC University teacher  Nabila Idris told New Age without disclosing further details. The battalion on Thursday offered public apology for the extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and all other misdeeds it had perpetrated since its establishment in 2004. ‘One cannot get pardon after killing people. RAB has to be punished for its misdeeds,’ said another commission member and human rights activist Sazzad Hossain. According to rights organisation Ain O Salish Kendra, 3,973 people were killed in reported crossfire and encounters with members of law enforcement and security agencies or died in their custody between January 2004 and June 2024. Of them, 1,286 people were killed in reported gunfights with the RAB or in its custody, as reported by the elite force, the ASK data shows. It also shows that the RAB and police are jointly accused of killing 94 people during the same period. On December 10, 2021, the United States Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the RAB for human rights abuse. The commission said that they already recorded 1,676 complaints of enforced disappearances, while 758 complaints have already been scrutinised, said the chief aadviser’s press wing. The commission estimates the number of enforced disappearances in the country would cross 3,500. Asked about how many victims of the 758 scrutinised disappearances are missing, commission member Sazzad Hossain said that 23 per cent of them were still missing and 77 per cent reappeared later. Directorate General of Forces Intelligence, the Rapid Action Battalion, the police, the Detective Branch of police, the Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime unit and thr Criminal Investigation Department were allegedly involved in the enforced disappearances, according to commission members. The press release quoted commission chairman Justice Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury as saying that they found a ‘systematic design’ to hide the incidents of enforced disappearance. The commission also found that forces exchanged the victims and operations were deliberately segmented, said the release. Individuals carrying out enforced disappearance or extrajudicial killing lacked knowledge about victims, the release quoted Justice Moyeenul. The commission chairman said that they would submit another interim report in March and would require at least another year to complete the scrutiny of all allegations they received. The chief adviser thanked the commission for submitting the interim report and promised all possible support in accomplishing the job. ‘You are doing a really very important job. We are ready to give you all kinds of support that you need,’ the release quoted Yunus as saying. The chief adviser said that he would visit some of the Aynaghar or secret detention centres and joint interrogation cells detected by the commission to get first-hand knowledge about the sufferings of the victims. Earlier, the commission alleged that some evidence was destroyed in secret detention centres and some cell structures were also changed. Commission members said that it found secret detention centres at eight places in Dhaka city and its adjoining areas, including the DGFI’s joint interrogation cell popularly known as ‘Aynaghar’ located at its headquarter. Commission member Nabila Idris said that they also found a secret detention centre of RAB-7 in Chattogram. ‘We are yet to visit all the places as we have been working for about three months. If we visit other areas of the country, we will surely find more secret detention centres,’ she told New Age. Commission members Justice Farid Ahmed Shibli, human rights activist Nur Khan Liton, BRAC University teacher Nabila Idris, and human rights activist Sazzad Hossain, interim government’s advisory council members Adilur Rahman Khan and Sharmeen S Murshid, chief adviser’s principal secretary Md Siraj Uddin Mia and press secretary Shafiqul Alam, among others, were present during the submission of the report. The commission was formed by the interim government led by professor Muhammad Yunus after it had taken office on August 8 following the ouster of Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League regime on August 5 through a student-led mass uprising.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252804/commission-finds-involvement-of-hasina-in-enforced-disappearance-recommends-disbanding-of-rab

11 Bangladesh nationals rescued from human traffickers in Malaysia,"The Malaysian Immigration Department busted a human trafficking syndicate and rescued 11 Bangladeshis during a special operation in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday night. The syndicate was reportedly led by three Bangladeshi men.

Four people arrested for attacking Hindu community in Sunamganj,"Members of law enforcement agencies on Saturday arrested four people in connection with the vandalism and attack on several homes and shops of the Hindu community and a temple at Doarabazar upazila in Sunamganj over a complaint of dishonouring the holy Quran by a Hindu youth on December 3. The arrestees are Alim Hossain, 19, Sultan Ahmed Raju, 20, Shajahan Hossain, 20, and Imran Hossain, 31, of sadar union under the Doarabazar upazila, said a statement issued by the Chief Adviser’s Office. On December 3, a Facebook post by a Hindu youth in upazila sparked tensions in the district. Even though the youth deleted the post, screenshots spread widely, leading to violence in the area, forcing the local police to arrest him immediately in an effort to bring the situation under control. Later in the following morning, the police filed a case under the Cyber Security Act against the youth and he was sent to jail in the case by the district judicial magistrate court. Doarabazar Police Station officer-in-charge Md Zahidul Islam confirmed the arrest of four youths. He said that the police filed a case early Saturday against naming 12 people and some 150 to 170 other unidentified people. ‘Police filed the case 10 days after the incident as the people of the Hindu community did not agree to submit a written complaint with the police station in this regard,’ the OC said. He informed that the four youths were arrested at their respective houses early Saturday and later produced before the district judicial magistrate court that sent them to jail.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252801/four-people-arrested-for-attacking-hindu-community-in-sunamganj
Helal Hafiz buried with state honours,"Renowned poet Helal Hafiz, widely known as poet of rebellion and love, was laid to rest at the Martyred Intellectuals’ Graveyard at Mirpur in Dhaka on Saturday. People from different walks of life, including law adviser Professor Asif Nazrul, cultural affairs adviser Mostofa Sarwar Farooki, chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam, poets, cultural activists, journalists, and the poet’s brothers Dulal Hafiz and Nehal Hafiz paid tribute to the poet by placing floral wreaths on his coffin at the Bangla Academy and the National Press Club in the capital. His first namaz-e-janaza was held on the academy premises, and second namaz-e-janaza on the press club. Referring to the poet’s first collection of poems titled Je Jale Agun Jwale, Farooki said that it was rare in the country’s culture and literature to become so much popular with the publication of only book. Addressing the due recognition from the government, Farooki also said that a true writer did not write to get award. ‘But, it is the nation’s responsibility to express the gratitude towards writers with awards.’ Helal Hafiz was not awarded with the Independence Award and the Ekushey Padak, said Farooki, adding, ‘The ministry will take steps to pay due recognition to the poet.’ Jatiya Kabita Parishad convener poet Mohon Raihan said that Helal Hafiz was a poet of rebellion and love. Previous governments, however, failed to recognise the contributions of the poet but he was able to win the hearts of people, he said. Mentioning that Helal Hafiz was a politically conscious poet and a true patriot, Mohon Raihan said, ‘We widely used lines from the poem “Nishiddha Sampadakiya” in posters, graffiti works and slogans to inspire people in different movements against oppression and autocracy.’ Recitation artiste Rashid Kamal said that the poet dedicated his life to writing poems. ‘He said in a poem that he wanted to earn the love from people when others wanted to earn money. He successfully achieved what he dreamt for.’ The 76-year-old poet passed away on Friday. Born on October 7, 1948, Helal Hafiz first collection of poems titled Je Jale Agun Jwale, published in 1986, earned him huge acclaim. His second collection of poems titled Kabita Ekattar was published after a long hiatus of 26 years. Helal Hafiz also worked as a journalist in several newspapers, including Purbadesh, Desh and Jugantar. For his contribution to Bangla literature, he received different awards, including Jashore Sahitya Puraskar in 1986, and Bangla Academy Literary Award in 2013.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/literature/252800/helal-hafiz-buried-with-state-honours

Independent audit clears Nagad of allegations,"Nagad, one of Bangladesh’s leading mobile financial service providers, has been cleared of allegations of financial misconduct after a thorough audit by an independent firm, carried out under regulatory oversight, according to official sources. They said that the review addressed claims of irregularities, fraud and unauthorised digital money creation, with no evidence of wrongdoing found. The audit confirmed Nagad’s compliance with established financial regulations, dismissing accusations, including claims of undue influence by powerful figures. A company spokesperson, Niaz Morshed, welcomed the outcome, saying, ‘The audit reaffirms what we have always maintained: Nagad operates with transparency and integrity.’ Since its launch in 2019, Nagad has grown to become a key player in the mobile financial services (MFS) sector. With over 90 million customers and a 40% market share, the company has stood out for its innovative offerings and a unique partnership model with the government, sharing 51% of its revenue with the state.

The new venture aims to expand banking services to underserved communities, furthering financial inclusion in Bangladesh. Meanwhile, allegations against its founder Tanvir A Mishuk were dismissed in court. The case, initiated through a General Diary by Badiuzzaman Didar, was found to lack merit following a legal review. Mishuk’s legal representative, Barrister M Nawshad Zamir, said, ‘The court’s decision underscores the baselessness of the claims. Mishuk has always upheld the highest standards of professionalism and transparency.’ Though Bangladesh Bank has not yet issued a statement regarding the audit findings, Nagad has expressed confidence in the resolution of these matters as a reflection of its integrity and operational compliance. This outcome is expected to bolster the company’s standing in the fintech industry and support its continued growth and innovation.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/252797/independent-audit-clears-nagad-of-allegations

Culture affairs adviser Mostofa Sarwar Farooki, director of the Bangla Academy were, among others, present. Nehal Hafiz said, ‘We have lost him as a family member, but Bangladesh’s literary arena has lost a great personality.’ Recitation artist Rashid Kamal said, ‘As long as Bangladesh’s history exists, Helal Hafiz will remain relevant. Even in the 24’ uprising, he was significant.’ He added, ‘Helal Hafiz used to tell me, ‘If you want to write something, you must read a lot. Then, write very little. Publish even less.’’ Family members of Helal Hafiz shared that they tried several times to take him to a hospital, but he insisted, ‘I have no time left, I quit.’ Farooki said when you talk about the songs of youth, Helal Hafiz’s name always comes to mind. He said, ‘I don’t know if any other poet has influenced the history of a nation’s art and culture as much with just one poetry book. He didn’t write many books, but whenever we talk about songs and youth, Helal Hafiz’s name comes up. That is his achievement.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/literature/252795/people-pay-last-tribute-to-poet-helal-hafiz-at-bangla-academy

Dhaka becomes most polluted city with AQI score of 281,"Dhaka, the overcrowded capital of Bangladesh, has topped the list of cities worldwide with the worst air quality with an AQI score of 281 at about 9:10am on Saturday. Dhaka’s air was classified as ‘very unhealthy’, according to the air quality and pollution city ranking. Pakistan’s Lahore, India’s Delhi and Afghanistan’s Kabul occupied the next three spots, with AQI scores of 216, 179 and 178, respectively. An AQI between 151 and 200 is said to be ‘unhealthy’ while 201 and 300 is considered ‘very unhealthy’, and 301 to 400 is ranked ‘hazardous’, posing serious health risks to residents. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants — Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2 and Ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon. As per the World Health Organisation, air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/environment-climate-change/252790/dhaka-becomes-most-polluted-city-with-aqi-score-of-281
South Korean president faces second impeachment vote,"South Korean lawmakers vote Saturday on whether to impeach president Yoon Suk Yeol over his failed martial law bid, a second parliamentary showdown that appeared on a knife edge. A week after a first attempt to remove Yoon for the martial law debacle foundered, the National Assembly will vote at around 4:00pm local time (0700 GMT) on whether to impeach him for ‘insurrectionary acts undermining the constitutional order’. Yoon has vowed to fight ‘until the very last minute’ and doubled down on unsubstantiated claims the opposition is in league with the country’s communist foes. Thousands of South Koreans have taken to the streets of Seoul to demand Yoon’s resignation and imprisonment after his short-lived martial law declaration sent soldiers and helicopters to parliament in the past week. And massive rallies supporting impeachment are expected to gather near the parliament around midday. Organisers have promised to distribute food and banners to the protesters to lift their spirits in the freezing December temperatures. And K-pop singer Yuri of the band Girl’s Generation –– whose song ‘Into the New World’ has become a protest anthem –– said she had pre-paid for food for fans that attended the rally. ‘Stay safe and take care of your health,’ she said on a superfan chat platform. Two hundred votes are needed for the impeachment to pass, meaning opposition lawmakers must convince eight parliamentarians from Yoon’s conservative People Power Party to switch sides. As of Friday, seven ruling party lawmakers had pledged to support impeachment –– leaving the vote up in the air. Opposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung has implored ruling PPP lawmakers to side with the ‘people wailing out in the freezing streets’. ‘Please join in supporting the impeachment vote tomorrow,’ he said on Friday. ‘History will remember and record your choice.’ Two PPP lawmakers supported the motion in the past week’s vote. Opposition lawmaker Kim Min-seok said on Friday that he was ‘99 per cent’ sure the impeachment motion would pass. Should it be approved, Yoon would be suspended from office while South Korea’s Constitutional Court deliberates. The South Korean prime minister, Han Duck-soo would step in as the interim president. The court would then have 180 days to rule on Yoon’s future. If it backs his removal, Yoon would become the second president in South Korean history to be successfully impeached. There is also precedent for the court to block impeachment. In 2004, then-president Roh Moo-hyun was removed by parliament for alleged election law violations and incompetence, but the Constitutional Court later reinstated him. The court also currently only has six judges, meaning their decision would need to be unanimous. And should the vote fail, Yoon can still face ‘legal responsibility’ for the martial law bid, Kim Hyun-jung, a researcher at the Korea University Institute of Law, told AFP. ‘This is clearly an act of insurrection,’ she said. ‘Even if the impeachment motion does not pass, the president’s legal responsibilities under the Criminal Code... cannot be avoided.’ Yoon has remained unapologetic and defiant as the fallout from his disastrous martial law declaration has deepened and an investigation into his inner circle has widened. On Friday, prosecutors said they had arrested a military commander who headed the Capital Defence Command. Arrest warrants were also issued by the Seoul Central District Court for the national police chief and the head of the city’s police, citing the ‘risk of destruction of evidence’. Yoon’s approval rating –– never very high –– has plummeted to 11 per cent, according to a Gallup Korea poll released on Friday. The same poll showed 75 per cent now support his impeachment. Protesters calling for his ouster for more than a week run the gamut of South Korean society –– from K-pop fans waving glowsticks to retirees and blue-collar workers. ‘Impeachment is a must and we must fight relentlessly,’ Kim Sung-tae, a 52-year-old worker at a car parts manufacturer, told AFP. ‘We’re fighting for the restoration of democracy.’ Teacher Kim Hwan-ii agreed. ‘I am so angry that we all have to pay the price for electing this president.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/252789/south-korean-president-faces-second-impeachment-vote
US closely monitoring Bangladesh situation: White House,"US President Joe Biden is closely monitoring the evolving situation in Bangladesh emphasising the importance of protecting religious and ethnic minorities under the interim government, said the White House. Addressing a news briefing on Thursday, White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby stated, ‘We're watching this very, very, very closely, and the president is following events closely as well.’ Responding to a query from Lalit K Jha, Press Trust of India's (PTI's) bureau chief in Washington DC, Kirby acknowledged the challenging security environment in Bangladesh following the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. ‘We have been working closely with the interim government to enhance the capability of their law enforcement and security services to deal with the challenge,’ Kirby added. When asked if President Biden raised the issue during his recent meeting with Muhammad Yunus on the sidelines of the UN, Kirby reiterated the administration's commitment to minority protection. Kirby said, ‘We have been very clear in our engagement with all Bangladeshi leaders that protection of religious and ethnic minorities and security for all Bangladeshis, regardless of religion or ethnicity, is critical. We want to hold them to that.’  ",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/252788/us-closely-monitoring-bangladesh-situation-white-house
Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib banned from bowling in ECB competitions,"Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan has been banned from bowling in England and Wales Cricket Board competitions due to an illegal action. Shakib was reported by umpires during the spinner's one-game appearance in the County Championship for Surrey in September. The 37-year-old left-armer was signed specifically for the crucial clash with title rivals Somerset on a Taunton pitch that was expected to help spin bowling. Shakib took nine wickets across both innings' in Surrey's 111-run defeat, with his team going on to win the title despite that loss. An ECB statement read: ‘Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan has been suspended from bowling in ECB competitions following an independent assessment of his bowling action. ‘Shakib's action was reported by the standing umpires while he was playing for Surrey in the County Championship match against Somerset in September. ‘Shakib completed an independent assessment at Loughborough University earlier this month, which found that the elbow extension in his bowling action exceeded the 15 degree threshold as defined in the regulations. ‘This suspension takes effect from the receipt of the independent assessment on 10 December 2024.’ Shakib, who has not signed a contract with an English county for the 2025 season, is ineligible to bowl in ECB competitions until he has passed an independent re-assessment of his bowling action. He has played 71 Tests, 247 one-day internationals and 129 Twenty20s for Bangladesh, taking a combined 712 wickets.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252787/bangladesh-all-rounder-shakib-banned-from-bowling-in-ecb-competitions
"Kremlin praises Trump, pounds Ukraine in massive attack","The Kremlin said Friday that US president-elect Donald Trump’s opposition to Ukraine’s use of US weapons to hit Russia ‘fully aligned’ with Moscow’s position, hours after it launched a massive aerial barrage on Ukraine. The nearly three-year conflict is escalating ahead of Trump coming to power in January, with both sides seeking to gain an upper hand on the battlefield amid mounting speculation of ceasefire talks. Russia launched one of its largest missile attacks ever in the early hours of Friday, targeting Ukraine’s energy grid as temperatures dropped below freezing, in what Moscow called a retaliatory strike for Kyiv firing US weapons on a southern Russian airfield earlier this week. The Kremlin had warned it would respond to Kyiv’s use of ATACMS missiles and then praised Trump, who said using the weapons to hit deep into Russia was a ‘foolish’ idea. ‘The statement fully aligns with our position, with our view on the reasons for escalation,’ Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ‘That impresses us. It is obvious that Trump understands exactly what is escalating the situation.’ Moscow has repeatedly raged against Western arms supplied to Ukraine and said the use of Western weapons makes NATO countries direct participants in the nearly three-year conflict. ‘In response to the use of American long-range weapons, a massive strike was carried out by the Russian armed forces against critical facilities of Ukraine’s fuel and energy infrastructure,’ Russia’s defence ministry said in a post on Telegram. The attack ‘severely damaged’ some Ukrainian power plants, the DTEK power provider said, and knocked out electricity to thousands of people. Russia fired 94 missiles in the barrage — including cruise and ballistic missiles — and almost 200 drones, according to Ukraine’s air force. It claimed to have shot down 81 of the missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attack showed Moscow had no interest in peace. ‘This is Putin’s ‘peace plan’ — to destroy everything. This is how he wants ‘negotiations’ — by terrorising millions of people,’ he said in a post on X. He called for more Western air defence systems to protect Ukraine’s skies and harsher sanctions on Moscow, to limit its ability to wage war. The attack hit some thermal power plants belonging to Ukrainian energy provider DTEK. ‘The massive attack severely damaged thermal power plant equipment,’ DTEK said without specifying how many facilities were hit. There were reports of explosions in several regions, and damage to infrastructure in the western region of Ivano-Frankivsk. Half of the western Ternipol region was left without power, officials said. ‘As Ukrainians wake to the coldest day of the winter so far, the enemy tries to break our spirit with this cynical terrorist attack,’ DTEK CEO Maxim Timchenko later said. Energy workers were assessing the damage and had already started work on restoring power. Ukraine, which had already been implementing hours-long outages, announced increased restrictions on Friday. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly denounced the attacks on its energy system as attempts to break the population’s morale. ‘Russia aims to deprive us of energy. Instead, we must deprive it of the means of terror,’ foreign minister Andriy Sybiga said on social media after the latest strike. He said Ukraine needed 20 NASAMS, HAWK or IRIS-T air defence systems. In his interview with Time Magazine, which named him person of the year, Trump insisted he would not abandon Ukraine. But his repeated remarks boasting he could end the war in hours have raised fears he might force Ukraine into a deal on Russia’s terms. The outgoing Joe Biden administration is racing to bolster aid to Kyiv before Trump’s inauguration in January. Western leaders are also stepping up their diplomatic efforts, with growing talk of the possible deployment of peacekeeping troops. French president Emmanuel Macron and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk discussed the possibility of stationing foreign troops in Ukraine in case of a ceasefire, in a meeting in Warsaw on Thursday, Tusk said. But the Kremlin has pushed back on the idea that the two sides can be brought to the negotiating table easily. ‘We don’t want a ceasefire, we want peace, after our conditions are met and all our goals are achieved,’ Kremlin spokesman Peskov told reporters on Friday. He said that right now Moscow’s ‘prerequisites for negotiations’ were not in place.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/north-america/252786/kremlin-praises-trump-pounds-ukraine-in-massive-attack
CU students stage demo locking main gate,"Chittagong University students staged a demonstration on Friday evening locking the university’s main gate in protest against an attack on two students near the university’s transport office. The demonstration began at around 7:30pm and continued for about 30 minutes. The protesters reopened the gate after assurances from the university proctor of action against the attackers. Earlier, the attack allegedly occurred early Friday when a group of 5-6 masked assailants, armed with local weapons, assaulted two students, Mohibul Islam Mohib and Nirab Ahmed, both are first-year students from the international relations department (2023-24 session). According to classmates of the victims, the attackers wore mufflers and masks to conceal their identities. As news of the incident spread, students from the Department of International Relations staged a protest at the CU security office, demanding immediate action. Later, in the evening, they escalated their demands by locking the university’s main gate. Speaking on the matter, CU chief of security Golam Kibria said, ‘A security team was dispatched to the scene immediately after we were informed. They conducted searches in the adjacent hill areas but failed to locate the attackers.’ CU proctor professor Tanvir Mohammad Haider Arif said, ‘The university has 90 CCTV cameras installed at various points. By analysing video footage, we are trying to identify the culprits by this Sunday. Those responsible will be brought to book.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252785/cu-students-stage-demo-locking-main-gate
Iftekharuzzaman suggests controlling energy investors,"Energy sector investment has to be controlled to prevent in future the rise of authoritative government like the one of Sheikh Hasina, said Transparency International Bangladesh executive director Iftekharuzzaman. Energy sector was among some of the crucial public agencies that suffered policy capture during the immediate past government for establishing its authoritative rule, he said. ‘An energy sector investor must have certain limit to exercise control in the sector,’ said Iftekhar, speaking at the Bangladesh Energy Prosperity 2050 conference on Friday afternoon. Over 300 participants joined the three-day conference held at BIAM foundation that concluded on Friday. The conference featured 46 keynote papers and 96 speakers, about a dozen from abroad. The conference came up with a set of recommendations aimed at the expansion of renewable energy, replacing fossil fuels. Environment, forest and climate change adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan once again reminded that cancelling fossil fuel power plants would not be so easy. ‘Coal-based and Rooppur nuclear power plants are not going to be cancelled,’ said Rizwana. ‘They will continue to be a thorn in our side,’ she said. He, however, thought it would be wise for public agencies to develop their capacity to monitor the health and environmental impacts these power plants are going to have. Experts working on the power and energy sector of the country demanded initiating a ‘no electricity no pay’ policy for all power plants, which might be able to lessen the fiscal burden of the country. They also demanded reducing all types of import duties for the renewable energy accessories necessary for both utility-scale and household solar power plants until the renewable energy industry operates at a full pace in the country. BUET professor Ijaz Hossain questioned why there was no net-zero target for Bangladesh yet, under the current interim government. ‘The environment ministry hasn’t declared a net-zero target for Bangladesh yet. This is the reason why renewable energy is not being promoted in the country,’ he said. Hasan Mehedi, member secretary of Bangladesh Working Group on Ecology and Development, the main organiser of the conference, read out the conference declaration. There were 23 co-organisers of the event.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252784/iftekharuzzaman-suggests-controlling-energy-investors
Judges to get Tk 30 lakh interest-free car loan,"The government is going to provide Tk 30 lakh as an interest-free loan to judges each for buying car, paying necessary expenses such as registration, fitness and tax token fees. ‘Tk 30 lakh will be provided in a single instalment as interest-free loan for buying a car and paying other concomitant charges like registration, fitness and tax token fees as per provision 6 (4) of the Bangladesh Judicial Service Members’ Interest-free Loan and Transport Service Encashment Policy, 2024,’ a law and justice division gazette notification said. Signed by law and justice division secretary Sheikh Abu Taher, the gazette notification said that one per cent service charge would be imposed for receiving the loan. Bangladesh judicial service members, district judges, additional district judges, and judicial officials’ equivalent to joint district judges, who have passed 15 years in Bangladesh Judicial Service, and senior secretary or secretary of the law and justice division, who was appointed from Bangladesh Judicial Service, would get the benefit, said another gazette notification on Thursday. Judges, who will buy a vehicle under the policy, will also be provided Tk 50,000 a month for paying the salary of the driver and maintaining fuel costs. The decision came following the directive of chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed to formulate policy to provide adequate transport services for the judges in the country. The chief justice, while declaring a roadmap for the judiciary on September 21, reiterated the call for providing adequate transport services for the judges of the subordinate courts. ‘The fact that judges working in subordinate courts are not provided with adequate vehicles with appropriate status and facilities compared to other officials of the republic is a form of discrimination,’ he said on that day. Referring to the chief justice’s instruction in this regard, the Supreme Court administration on December 1 sent a letter to the finance ministry to take necessary steps in this regard.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252783/judges-to-get-tk-30-lakh-interest-free-car-loan
Alif’s eyes remained wide open after he was shot,"Alif Ahmed Siam had always been a standout all-rounder, from topping his class to excelling in sport. His dedication and talent earned him several accolades in both arenas. The 15-year-old boy had been actively involved in the protests demanding quota reform in government jobs, which began on July 1 and escalated into a mass uprising later that month. His father, Bulbul Kabir, a clothing vendor at Jahangirnagar University and a resident of Islam Nagar near the university, was also an active participant in the movement, inspiring his son to join the cause. Alif, the eldest of his parents’ two children, was severely injured during the protest at the JU in July, an incident that deeply upset his mother, Tania Akter, prompting her to sternly forbid him from participating in the protests again. But, his mother could not stop him from joining the ‘Long March to Dhaka,’ a protest demanding the ouster of the Awami League government, which took place just hours before Sheikh Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled to India on August 5. His mother burst into tears upon learning over the phone at around 1:30pm from a friend of Alif that he had joined the protest that day. Not long after, a bullet pierced through Alif’s head near the Savar Bus Stand area. The Class X student at Savar Dairy Farm High School, who dreamt of becoming a pilot to travel the world, breathed his last at 6:00pm on August 7 at Enam Medical College Hospital in Savar. He was among 708 people who lost their lives during the uprising, according to a preliminary list released by the Directorate General of Health Services on September 24.  The listing of deaths in the uprising is also going on. Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on November 17 said that about 1,500 people were killed and 19,931 others injured during the uprising. Tania urged Alif to come back home from the Long March, but he refused, saying, ‘If I do not return, Ma, you will be the mother of a martyr,’ she recalled, crying on December 12. ‘When the police and plain-clothes officers wearing helmets suddenly opened fire, Alif hid behind the road divider. Once the firing seemed to stop, he stood up to check his surroundings but collapsed on the street, struck by a bullet. His eyes were wide open, and he didn’t even have a chance to blink. Later, doctors had to close them with Scotch tape,’ said his mother. Bulbul and Tania moved to Dhaka from Barhat’s Borobashbaria village when Alif was two years old, hoping to give him a better life. They struggled to survive in the city, but took comfort in the hope of a better future for their children. After Alif’s death, Tania left her job as a school teacher, and Bulbul also struggled to focus on his business. The couple has a 12-year-old daughter, Israt Jahan Lamha.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252782/alifs-eyes-remained-wide-open-after-he-was-shot

Victory rallies celebrate end of Assad,"Thousands of jubilant people rallied in cities across Syria, including at a landmark mosque in the capital Damascus, to celebrate during the first Friday prayers since the ouster of president Bashar al-Assad. More than half a century of brutal rule by the Assad clan came to a sudden end on Sunday, after a lightning rebel offensive swept across the country and took the capital. Assad fled Syria, closing an era in which suspected dissidents were jailed or killed, and capping nearly 14 years of war that killed more than 5,00,000 people and displaced millions. Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, head of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham which spearheaded the offensive, called on Syrians ‘to go to the streets to express their joy’ on Friday to mark ‘the victory of the blessed revolution’. During the early days of Syria’s uprising in 2011, pro-democracy protesters used to give their Friday gatherings a different name every week. The latest rally was called the ‘Friday of victory’. Interim prime minister Mohammed al-Bashir addressed a large congregation at Damascus’s landmark Umayyad Mosque. Thousands flocked to the mosque, some raising the three-star Syrian independence flag which none dared wave in the capital during Assad’s iron-fisted rule. Exhilarated crowds chanted ‘the Syrian people is one!’ ‘I still feel like I’m dreaming,’ said 52-year-old Khalil Rimo. ‘I still can’t believe that I’m standing next to the Umayyad Mosque and there are no government thugs’ asking for ID, Rimo said. ‘We are gathering because we’re happy Syria has been freed, we’re happy to have been liberated from the prison in which we lived,’ said Nour Thi al-Ghina, 38. Thousands of people also gathered in the squares and streets in other Syrian cities, including Homs, Hama and Idlib. There was a festive and relaxed atmosphere as hundreds rallied in the main square of Syria’s second city Aleppo, a scene of fierce fighting during the country’s civil war, AFP correspondents reported. A huge billboard depicting Assad and his father Hafez was set on fire. ‘The Assad father and son oppressed us, but we have liberated our country from injustice,’ a white-bearded policeman at the scene said. In the southern city of Sweida, the heartland of Syria’s Druze minority where anti-government demonstrations have been held for more than a year, hundreds took to the streets, singing and clapping in jubilation. ‘Our joy is indescribable,’ said Haitham Hudeifa, 54. ‘Every province is celebrating this great victory.’ Sunni Muslim HTS is rooted in Syria’s branch of al-Qaeda and designated a terrorist organisation by many Western governments, who now face the challenge of how to approach the country’s new leadership. The group has sought to moderate its rhetoric, and the interim government insists the rights of all Syrians will be protected — as will the rule of law. The United Nations refugee agency said on Friday that the new government had sent ‘constructive’ initial signals, including asking the organisation to stay in the country. Leaders of the Group of Seven countries, who were due to meet virtually on Friday, said they were ready to support the transition to an ‘inclusive and non-sectarian’ government in Syria. They called for the protection of human rights, including those of women and minorities, while emphasising ‘the importance of holding the Assad regime accountable for its crimes’. Inside much of Syria, the focus is turning towards unravelling the secrets of Assad’s rule, and particularly the network of detention centres and suspected torture sites scattered across areas previously under government control. Syrians have flooded to prisons, hospitals and morgues in search of long-disappeared loved ones, hoping for a miracle, or at least closure. ‘I turned the world upside down looking,’ Abu Mohammed told AFP as he searched for news of three missing relatives at the Mazzeh airbase in Damascus. ‘But I didn’t find anything at all. We just want a hint of where they were, one per cent.’ The International Committee of the Red Cross said it has documented over 35,000 cases of disappearances during Assad’s rule, adding the true number was likely far higher. Assad was propped up by Russia — where a senior Russian official told US media he has fled — as well as Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group. The rebels launched their offensive on November 27, the same day a ceasefire took effect in the Israel-Hezbollah war, which saw Israel inflict staggering losses on Assad’s Lebanese ally. Both Israel and Turkey, which backs some of the rebels who ousted Assad, have since carried out strikes inside Syria. Speaking on Thursday in Jordan, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stressed the importance of ‘not sparking any additional conflicts’ after mentioning both Israeli and Turkish military activity in Syria. In an unannounced visit to Baghdad on Friday, Blinken said that ‘as Syria transitions from the Assad dictatorship to hopefully a democracy’, it should ‘not become in any way a platform for terrorism’. Washington has troops in both Syria and Iraq as part of a coalition against the Islamic State group. Hours after Assad’s ouster, Israel sent troops into a UN-patrolled buffer zone that separated Israeli and Syrian forces on the Golan Heights, in a move the UN said violated a 1974 armistice. Israeli troops have been ordered to ‘prepare to remain’ in the buffer zone throughout the winter, Defence Minister Israel Katz’s office said on Friday. Syrians meanwhile face a struggle for basic necessities in a country ravaged by war, sanctions and runaway inflation. On Friday, the European Union announced the launch of an ‘air bridge’ operation to deliver an initial 50 tonnes of health supplies to Syria via neighbouring Turkey.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252780/victory-rallies-celebrate-end-of-assad
Early cold wave signals colder winter,"The Bangladesh Meteorological Department announced the first cold wave of the season on Friday, about three weeks earlier than the past year. A cold wave, which can be mild, moderate and severe, reflects the fall of air temperature over a large area below 10C. The first cold wave of the season, which is likely to continue, was a mild one with the lowest day temperature of 8.4C recorded in Tetulia, one of the coldest places of the country. The cold wave was sweeping over Panchagarh, Rajshahi and Chuadanga, the meteorological department said. Last year, the first cold wave began on January 2, the second month of the three-month-long winter season. ‘This winter might feel a bit colder this year,’ meteorologist Afroza Sultana told New Age. Winter in Bangladesh brings dry air blowing from the west to the south, also known as westerly wind. The meteorological department has observed a dominating presence of westerly this year. ‘There may be more fog this year, intensifying the feeling of cold,’ said Afroza. This December might stand out in many other recent Decembers since the month has been growing increasingly warmer, according to a BMD report titled ‘Changing climate of Bangladesh’, released in February. The temperature observations from Bangladesh showed a clear climate signal, with fewer and shorter cold waves in the recent decades, the report said. Cold waves became concentrated in January in Dhaka division, the report said, revealing that these waves occurred most frequently in January. There were some cases of cold waves in December and February as well, according to the report. In one of the coldest areas of the country, Rangpur division, cold waves started in early or mid-December throughout the period studied—1980–2023. The northern district recorded a cold wave even in November in 1981. Even for the coldest place, the period of cold waves appears to have been delayed over the past few years, starting at the third or fourth week of December or even in January, the report said. Historically, cold waves were frequent in January and February but in recent years the end of February had been without any, the report said about Rangpur. In Rajshahi division, known for extreme heat during summer and intense cold during winter, the period of cold waves started in the first week of December up to 2006 but then decreased, indicating a delay in cold wave conditions. In 2023, no cold spell was recorded in December at all in Rajshahi. The number of cold wave days in December and February has decreased, but a large number of cold wave days were observed in January throughout the period 1980–2023 in Rajshahi, the BMD report said. Khulna division saw no cold waves in February since 1998. In 1997–2009, no cold waves were in December in the coastal division. Cold waves decreased in January after 2001. In Chattogram division, only one cold wave was ever recorded in December, February and March. No cold waves were recorded in the division in the last 10 years of the studied period. In Sylhet division, cold waves are no longer common in February as it used to be. January also got warmer with less cold days.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252779/early-cold-wave-signals-colder-winter
Death from drowning drops in Bangladesh: WHO,"World Health Organisation estimates that 9,600 drowning fatalities in 2021 in Bangladesh dropped significantly from 21,112 deaths of 2018. In a first-ever global report on drowning launched on Friday, WHO also estimates that globally estimated numbers of drowning deaths have fallen 20 per cent over the past two decades, from 3,75,000 in 2000 to 3,00,000 in 2021. The report also revealed that drowning was a significant threat to the lives of children and young people, ranking as the third leading global cause of death for children aged from 5 to 14 years, and fourth leading global cause of death for children aged 1-4 years. Over 90 per cent of drowning deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, highlighting that vulnerable communities are most at risk. WHO launched the report titled ‘Global Status Report on Drowning Prevention 2024’ at Intercontinental Hotel in Gevena in Switzerland on the day. The report is a result of statistics from 139 countries and territories across the world and is funded by the Bloomberg Philanthropies. Citing the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey 2018, the report said 40 per cent of the children aged between 1 and 4 years died due to drowning followed by 23 per cent of the children aged between 5 and 9 years, 14 per cent people aged between 40 and 59 per cent, each 6 per cent of people aged between 25 and 39 years and people aged over 60 years, 5 per cent people aged between 0 and 4 years and 3 per cent people aged between 10 and 14 years and 15 and 17 years each die from drowning. The governments of Bangladesh and Ireland are praised in the report for championing the adoption of the UN General Assembly and World Health Assembly resolutions on drowning prevention and endorsing World Drowning Prevention Day in 2021 marked on 25 July. The decline in drowning related deaths varies widely as it decreased by 68 per cent in the European region but only by 3 per cent in the African region. In 2021, the highest 84,000 deaths or 28 per cent of the total deaths from drowning occurred in the Western Pacific Region, the Southeast Asia region experienced 83,000 deaths or 28 per cent, followed by the African region with 66,000 deaths or 22 per cent, the Eastern Mediterranean region 35,000 deaths or 12 per cent, the region of the Americas 17,000 deaths or 6 per cent and while the European region saw 15,000 deaths or 5 per cent. At the report launching event, WHO Department for Social Determinants of Health director Etienne Krug termed drowning as a silent killer. Bloomberg Philanthropies public health team representative Kelly Larson praised the role of Bangladesh government in preventing drowning by investing in the Integrated Community-based Centre for Child Care, Protection and Swin-Safe Facilities project. The report says that drowning deaths remain a tragic and preventable public health crisis, and the declines seen in the past two decades fall short of what is needed to meet the wide range of SDG targets to which drowning prevention can contribute.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252778/death-from-drowning-drops-in-bangladesh-who
37 eminent Bangladesh citizens slam Indian media slurs,"Thirty-seven eminent citizens, including academics and right activists, have denounced and protested at the false and baseless  reports being circulated in the Indian media about the persecution of religious minorities in Bangladesh. In a joint statement, they said, ‘A certain quarter is deliberately stirring sectarian tension and spreading exaggerated and false information that religious minority communities in Bangladesh have been facing relentless attacks and persecution, with the intent of achieving their malicious political agenda.’ The statement, issued on Friday by Shamsul Huda, executive director of the Association for Land Reform and Development, noted that these malicious activities were a major obstacle in maintaining and advancing the historic, equal, and mutually respectful relations between the two countries, and urged all parties concerned to refrain from such actions. It highlighted that Sammilito Sanatani Jagaran Jot, in a recent press release, called for the intervention of the United Nations to protect the Hindu community in Bangladesh, which could not be viewed as an isolated incident, given the context of previous occurrences. The statement said that there were allegations that a certain quarter was forcing members of religious minority communities from Bangladesh, who were legally entering India with valid passports and visas, to give false statements claiming that they had faced various forms of harassment and persecution in Bangladesh, by confiscating their passports. The statement pointed out that the prime mastermind behind the unprecedented mass killings during the July-August uprising, now sheltered under Indian government security, was regularly spreading provocative anti-Bangladesh statements, although the Indian government, during the recent visit by its foreign secretary Shri Vikram Misri, claimed that it did not support such statements. ‘If that is the case, why are they not taking any action to prevent these objectionable statements from being spread by Sheikh Hasina and her associates in India?’ the statement questioned. Mentioning that the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government had already begun investigations into 88 such attacks and arrested 70 accused individuals, the signatories called for swift investigations into all the allegations of sectarian attacks and bringing the perpetrators to justice. The signatories included former Jahangirnagar University economics professor Anu Muhammad, human rights activist Sultana Kamal, Nijera Kori coordinator Khushi Kabir, Campaign for Popular Education executive director Rasheda K Chowdhury, barrister Sara Hossain, writer and activist Rahnuma Ahmed, and photographer Shahidul Alam. In another statement on Friday, 53 noted citizens, including journalists and artists, denounced anti-Bangladesh campaigns by a section of Indian media outlets saying that they were actually serving the interests of Indian right-wing extremist ruling party Bharatiya Janata Party, Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha reported.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252777/37-eminent-bangladesh-citizens-slam-indian-media-slurs
India denounced for spreading rumours against Bangladesh,"Protesters against Indian aggression towards Bangladesh on Friday blamed India for spreading rumours over torturing religious minorities in Bangladesh after the ouster of the Awami League government. They alleged that India was hatching such conspiracies as the country could not be able to use the interim government like slaves what it had done in Bangladesh during fascist Sheikh Hasina’s 16 years of misrule. Protests spread in Dhaka as elsewhere across the country hours after the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in India’s Agartala came under attack by a group of Indians on December 2 during their protests,  demanding the release of Hindu community leader in Bangladesh Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, now in jail in a sedition case. The protest for the attack on Bangladesh mission in India and India’s aggression against Bangladesh continued for the past 12 days. Addressing a rally organised by Jubo Odhikar Parishad in front of the National Press Club on Friday afternoon, Gono Odhikar Parishad faction president Nurul Haque Nur said that Indian media outlets, politicians and civil society representatives were spreading rumours that religious minorities were being tortured in Bangladesh after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina regime. ‘India had used the Awami League like a slave in the past 16 years but they could not use the interim government what they did with the Awami League government. This is why they are spreading such rumours and propaganda in Bangladesh,’ he added. He said that India continued to deprive people of Bangladesh of waters of 54 transboundary rivers with Bangladesh. He said that from now on, bilateral agreements would be made on the basis of equality. After the rally, they also brought out a torch procession protesting against India’s aggression and hegemony. Bangladesh Deshpremik Projonmo also formed a human chain demanding communal harmony in Bangladesh at the base of Raju Memorial Sculpture on the Dhaka University campus on Friday afternoon.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/252776/india-denounced-for-spreading-rumours-against-bangladesh
Fakhrul urges govt not to make political parties opponents,"Bangladesh Nationalist Party secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Friday urged the government not to make political parties its opponents. He also protested information and broadcasting adviser Nahid Islam’s accusation that political parties were trying to undermine the interim government and demanded the statement be withdrawn. ‘I don’t know why or in what context he [adviser Nahid] said this, or whether he understood the meaning of it. This is a dangerous  allegation. I strongly condemn and protest against it. I think he should withdraw his comment,’ he told a discussion at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh. Fakhrul called upon the interim government to be cautious in making its statements. ‘Please don’t make political parties your opponents.’ He said that students, people, and political parties, including the BNP, had all entrusted the interim government with the responsibility to create an environment in which a fair election could be held and a people’s government and parliament could be established. ‘Political parties are supporting you [government], but you’re claiming they are working to make you fail. We have stated this countless times, and our acting chairman has also said that the failure of this government would mean the failure of people and us. So, why do you make such statements?’ the BNP leader asked. He said that the government and democratic forces had to be very cautious with their words and actions. ‘We shouldn’t say anything that undermines our victory or destroys our achievements. This is the most critical time—one wrong step could lead to a setback, causing you to fall into a ditch,’ Fakhrul cautioned. He said that the fascist ruler Sheikh Hasina, who fled Bangladesh and took refuge in India, was actively working against the interests of the country. The Awami League leaders and workers were continuously engaging in false propaganda and spreading misinformation against the country using social media. The BNP leader urged his party colleagues to be active on social media, countering the misinformation with facts and intellectual discourse. He said that BNP leaders and workers had to continue their efforts to institutionalise democracy and establish a healthy democratic political culture in Bangladesh. ‘There is still much work ahead of us. Many people believe their job is done now as Hasina has fled, but we have a long way to go before we can make democracy both a culture and a system. Let’s take an oath that we will build ourselves into worthy citizens of the country and dedicated democratic workers,’ Fakhrul said. He said that democracy was not just a notion but a culture. ‘We must learn how to speak, how to behave, how to interact with our neighbours, and how to engage with our political opponents in a democratic way. Democracy does not mean cutting someone’s throat for supporting the Awami League or BNP. Democracy means absolute tolerance.’ Fakhrul also expressed concern over a current tendency to overshadow the 1971 Liberation War by glorifying the recent mass upsurge. ‘I believe this is part of a larger conspiracy to distance the nation from its original history. We see this as a distortion of history, and we must be careful about it,’ he added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/252775/fakhrul-urges-govt-not-to-make-political-parties-opponents
Martyred Intellectuals Day today,"The nation is set to observe Martyred Intellectuals Day today, paying rich tributes to the intellectuals who were victims of targeted killings by the Pakistani occupation forces and their local collaborators during the War of Independence in 1971. The Pakistani forces and their collaborators at the end of the War of  Independence, sensing their imminent defeat, systematically killed prominent Bangladeshi intellectuals and professionals on December 14, 1971. President Mohammed Shahabuddin and chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus on Friday paid rich tributes to the martyred intellectuals of 1971 on the occasion of the Martyred Intellectuals Day, reports Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha. In separate messages on the eve of the day, the president and the chief adviser urged the people to be united with discrimination-free spirit and play role from their respective positions to build a new Bangladesh by defeating all the conspiracies of the anti-liberation forces. ‘On this day in 1971, on the eve of the final victory in the great Liberation War, the invading forces, in collaboration with anti-liberations forces, brutally murdered the nation’s best sons of the soil, renowned educationists, doctors, scientists, writers, journalists, artists and many other distinguished persons,’ the president said in his message. The national flag will be hoisted at half-mast along with black flags today across the country. To mark the day, different socio-cultural and political organisations have taken elaborate programmes, including seminars and discussions in addition to placing wreaths at the memorials at Mirpur and Rayerbazar. Several television channels, including state-run Bangladesh Television, will air it live. From 8:30am on the day, people from all walks of life will offer wreaths at the Martyred Intellectuals Memorial. Different television and radio channels will hold special discussions on the occasion of the day.

No full list of martyred intellectuals in 53 years,"The nation still awaits a comprehensive list of its intellectuals killed by the Pakistani occupation army and their local collaborators to deprive the people, who were at war for independence, of their intellectual leadership. The nation is still in dark about the number of its bright sons and daughters who made their supreme sacrifice for the independence of the country as successive governments in the 53 years of independence could not finalise the list of intellectuals martyred during the war of independence. Families of the martyred intellectuals accused the successive governments of sheer neglect as they, along with the nation, observe Martyred Intellectuals Day today. It is extremely regrettable that the nation is yet to have a complete list of martyred intellectuals and professionals, Martyred intellectual Munier Chowdhury’s son Asif Munier told New Age. ‘Our expectations have not been fulfilled and the discussion on the martyred intellectuals is limited to the observance of the intellectuals day,’ he said. ‘Our fathers made supreme sacrifice for the state, so, I think the initiative should come from the state, not only from our families only.’ After 49 years of independence, the previous Awami league government in November 2020 formed an 11-member committee to finalise the list of martyred intellectuals. The committee, however, failed to publish a full list of the martyred intellectuals in the past four years. Committee member retired Lieutenant Colonel Quazi Sazzad Ali Zahir, Bir Protik, said, ‘We tried our level best to complete the job but there were some challenges to identify the martyred intellectuals due to the long gap of time.’ Based on the committee findings, the Ministry of Liberation War Affairs has published the names of 560 martyred intellectuals in four phases so far, he said. Now, the work of the committee has stopped after the fall of the AL government, he said adding, ‘I hope the committee or a new committee would work to complete the list.’ On April 7, 2021, the ministry published the first list containing the names of 191 martyred intellectuals, followed by the second list of 143 on May 29, 2022, the third list of 108 on February 15, 2024 and the fourth list of 118 martyred intellectuals in March 2024. Of the total 560 martyred intellectuals include 198 teachers, 113 doctors, 51 lawyers, 40 engineers, 37 government and private employees, 29 social workers, 20 politicians, 18 journalists, 18 litterateurs, 3 scientists, 1 philosopher, 1 researcher, and 1 painter. Apart from this, 30 cultural activists and individuals  associated with film, drama, music and other branches of liberal arts are also  on the list of martyred intellectuals. Earlier, the liberation war affairs ministry also formed a committee to compile a list of collaborators of the marauding  Pakistan military but there was no progress till now. Adviser for the liberation war affairs ministry Faruk-e Azam told New Age on Wednesday that there was no list of Razakars at the ministry and making one would be nearly impossible. ‘I have not received any files regarding the list of Razakars. The secretary has confirmed that the ministry has no copy or related documents,’ Azam said. He said, ‘Even if we want, it is not feasible to make a list of Razakars or Freedom Fighters. Compiling such a list from events that occurred 50 years ago, without reliable documentation, is an extremely difficult task.’ The ministry has no complete and comprehensive list of martyred intellectuals but figures provided by various government and private documents is 1,111. Independence war researchers believe that even the figure 1,111 was not correct and it should be 10 times the number. Shaheed Buddhijibi Koshgrantha, a biographical encyclopedia of martyred intellectuals published by the Bangla Academy, defined intellectuals as writers, scientists, artistes, singers, teachers from universities to primary schools, researchers, journalists, lawyers, physicians, engineers, architects, sculptors, government and non-government staff, people involved in film making and theatre, and social and cultural activists. When their defeat appeared imminent towards the end of the war, the Pakistani occupation army and their local auxiliaries Razakar, Al-Badr and Al-Shams abducted members of the Bengali intelligentsia blindfolded, with hands tied, from their houses to camps or other places. They never returned. Members of the Buddhijibi Nidhan Tathyanusandhan Committee, set up in 1972, had made a list of 20,000 of the finest minds of the nation who were killed. Shaheed Buddhijibi Koshgrantha, reprinted in 1994, put the number of intellectuals executed then at 232, but said that the list was neither complete nor comprehensive. The book defined martyrs as people who had been either killed by the Pakistani army or their collaborators or had gone missing between March 25, 1971 and January 31, 1972. ‘Bangladesh,’ a documentary publication of the government in 1972, said that the Pakistani occupation army and the local death squads had killed 1,109 — 21 university teachers, 59 college teachers, 270 secondary school teachers, 637 primary school teachers, 50 physicians, 41 lawyers and 13 journalists and 16 others. Banglapedia, or the National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh, estimated that 1,111 intellectuals were killed. Families of martyred intellectuals alleged that Chowdhury Mueenuddin and Ashrafuzzaman Khan, two Al-Badr leaders found guilty of killing 18 intellectuals, including journalists, university teachers, and physicians, by an International Crimes Tribunal-2 on November 3, 2013, were now currently living in the United Kingdom and the United States, respectively. There is little progress in bringing back Mueenuddin and Ashrafuzzaman, the only convicts for killing martyred intellectuals. The families alleged that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the deposed AL government did not take any official steps to bring the duo back to the country and execute the sentence.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252773/no-full-list-of-martyred-intellectuals-in-53-years
Khaliquzzaman Elias’ Rashomon available at bookshop,"Veteran writer-translator Professor Khaliquzzaman Elias-translated literary work titled Rashomon is available at different bookshops. The translated collection of stories in Bangla of Japanese fiction writer Ryunosuke Akutagawa was the writer-translator debut publication back in 1982. Publishing house Nautilas has recently ventured to bring out a new version of the book. Ryunosuke Akutagawa is sometimes considered as the father of modern Japanese short stories. His “Rashomon” brought him fame when the Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa made a film based on his stories in 1950, said Khaliquzzaman Elias. Today, readers are familiar with works of Natsume Soseki, Kazuo Ishiguro, Kenzaburo Oe, Sayaka Murata, Toshiki Okada, and mostly Haruki Murakami, he said, mentioning, ‘Akutagawa belongs to the first generation of modern Japanese writers who paved the way for the younger generation.’ Akutagawa, a pale and feeble young man, was also a highly sensitive and introverted person so much so that it made him a maniac, and finally he committed suicide at the age of 35. Pointing out that the power of the stories of Akutagawa lies in disinterested approach to life and the characters he dealt with, his merciless treatment of their personal traits, oddities, and religious superstitions, Khaliquzzaman Elias said, ‘The book contains seven short stories.’ ‘He chose the medieval Japanese literature, both oral and written, especially stories of Genji or Genji Monogatari as background of many of his stories and fine-tuned them with modern socio-psychological trends,’ he added. Readers can buy copies of Rashomon on the Facebook page of Nautilas. The book can also be purchased on online platforms, including Rokomari, and Bookharbour. Khaliquzzman Elias, who believes in the creativity of translation, has translated several classics of world literature. Among the major classics are James George Frazer’s The Golden Bough, Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, Richard Wright’s Black Boy, Joseph Campbell’s The Power of Myth, Frederick Douglass’s Narrative of an American Slave, Chinua Achebe’s Arrow of God and the Greek author Nikos Kazantzakis’s Zorba the Greek and Report to Greco, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Confessions.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/literature/252772/khaliquzzaman-elias-rashomon-available-at-bookshop

Birshreshtha Jahangir’s martyrdom anniv today,"Today is the 53rd martyrdom anniversary of the Liberation War’s hero Birshreshtha captain Mohiuddin Jahangir. The people of Chapainawabganj remember the day every year with mixed feelings of solemnity, joy, and sorrow as Birshreshtha Jahangir sacrificed his life to free the then Nawabganj sub-division from the clutches of the Pakistani occupation forces and their collaborators after fierce fighting on December 14 in 1971. Different programmes, including hoisting the national flag, placing wreaths at the grave of Birshreshtha Jahangir on Sonamasjid premises and at his monument at Rehaichar near Mohananda Bridge, and milad mahfil will be held to mark the day. Born on 8 March in 1949 at Rahimganj village under Babuganj upazila in Barishal district, Jahangir joined the armed forces as a cadet at the Pakistan military academy on October 5, 1967. After completing training, he joined as a commissioned officer at engineering core. Later, Jahangir got posted to the 173rd engineer battalion in Multan. After working with the battalion for six months, he was shifted to the military college of engineering in Risalpur. Following finishing the 13-month-long training, he took the bomb disposal training. In 1971, Jahangir was working at the construction site at Karakoram. On June 10, he took a few days leave and went back to Risalpur. One day later, he started his journey towards the Sialkot border to reach India. He managed to cross the border safely and joined the Mukti Bahini. On July 3, he became a captain of sector 7 with the responsibility to fight in Chapainawabganj. On December 14, Jahangir, along with his co-fighters, crossed the Mohananda River near Akandabaria and camped at Rehaichar near Chapainawabganj town before dawn. He intended to destroy one of the light machine gun bunkers of the Pakistan army and crawled towards it. He managed to come closer to the bunker and charge a grenade to it. But he was fired from another bunker, and immediately shot dead. Later, a group of freedom fighters recovered his body from Rehaichar, now the southern part of Birshreshtha Shahid Captain Mohiuddin Jahangir Bridge the next morning, and buried him on the Choto Sona Mosque premises under Shibganj Thana.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252769/birshreshtha-jahangirs-martyrdom-anniv-today
IUB member’s discovery of Firefly Sparkle published in Nature,"An associate member of the Centre for Astronomy, Space Science and Astrophysics of Independent University, Bangladesh, Astronomer Lamiya Mowla, has recently published a research paper in renowned science journal Nature on the discovery of Firefly Sparkle. Firefly Sparkle is a young galaxy dating back approximately 600 million years after the Big Bang when the universe was less than 5 per cent of its current age, said a press release on Thursday. An assistant professor at the Wellesley College in the United States, Lamia Mowla, said, ‘Light from the Firefly Sparkle took 13.2 billion years to reach us, but due to the universe’s expansion, the galaxy is now much farther away than 13.2 light years.’ Mowla added, ‘If we could observe it as it is today, it would likely resemble our own Milky Way. This gives us an incredible glimpse into how our galaxy might have looked in its infancy during the Epoch of Reionisation.’ This discovery, made as part of a research that analysed data from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope by Mowla and a team of 21 other scientists based mainly in North America, Europe and Japan, offers invaluable insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies, reminiscent of the early Milky Way. Located in a distant region of space, ‘Firefly Sparkle’ consists of 10 compact star clusters embedded within a sparsely packed arc of stars. The galaxy is accompanied by two smaller neighbouring galaxies, referred to as ‘Firefly-Best Friend’ and ‘Firefly-New Best Friend’, forming a fascinating triad that offers a unique glimpse into early cosmic evolution. The discovery leveraged the power of gravitational lensing – where light passes through warped space around a massive galaxy cluster in the foreground that acts as a magnifying glass – to amplify the light of ‘Firefly Sparkle’ by up to 26 times. This natural cosmic phenomenon allowed astronomers to study the intricate structure of the galaxy despite its immense distance from Earth. Khan Muhammad Bin Asad, director of CASSA and assistant professor at the department of Physical Sciences at IUB, said, ‘Professional astronomy and the study of astrophysics are only beginning in Bangladesh, and we aspire for IUB’s CASSA to be recognised as the pioneer in this field in the future. Congratulations to Mowla on publishing this groundbreaking research and gratitude for her association with us, sharing her research, resources, and knowledge, which have significantly contributed to building the foundation for astronomy education and research at IUB.’ IUB has the only research centre for astronomy and astrophysics in Bangladesh where professional astronomers work and it is the only university in the country to offer minor courses in Astronomy and Astrophysics. IUB also houses two outreach telescopes for deep-space imaging which were received from the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics of the University of Toronto, Canada, in 2022 through an outreach grant of Dr. Mowla. The Centre for Astronomy, Space Science and Astrophysics (CASSA) is dedicated to promoting education in these fields, conducting research, and contributing to global astronomical studies. The centre works to position Bangladesh as a proactive participant in the global scientific community.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252768/iub-members-discovery-of-firefly-sparkle-published-in-nature
Changes in practice of interrogation in custody sought,"Nearly 92 per cent respondents of an opinion poll, carried out by Police Reform Commission, have sought reforms of the interrogation in police custody, criticising the existing practice of tortures during grilling that often lead to suspects death. The opinion came as the commission conducted the survey among 24,442 randomly selected people under a study titled ‘what kind of police do we want’. In the survey, 91.7 per cent respondents replied positively while only 8.3 per cent said ‘no’ on the question on interrogation in police custody. The question posed in the questionnaire was that in view of allegations of torture and human rights violation during interrogations of accused on remand under section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 whether the respondents wanted reforms of the concerned law. In a supplementary question PRC wanted suggestions from the respondents, demanding the reform, and received four major suggestions with most proposing the interrogation room be surrounded by transparent glasses at every police station. They said that the glass room would facilitate people concerned to see from outside if police was using physical force during the grilling process. The respondents also called for amending the remand related law in line with a High Court directive. They recommended interrogation of women accused with decency in presence of female police. The commission made public the survey findings, saying that it agreed with the respondents’ opinions and it was crucial to take into account the opinions and suggestions. The public survey was carried out in the wake of recent criticism in Bangladesh and around the world about the violent role of some police personnel in suppressing the anti-discrimination student movement. The interim government formed the ‘Police Reform Commission’ to reform the police force. Asked how allegations of human rights violation and police’s power misuse should be investigated, 60 per cent respondents suggested formation of a complete investigation commission to pursue such matters. Twenty per cent people suggested formation of a permanent investigation commission, led by a retired High Court judge, and 20 per cent wanted such matters be reviewed by the National Human Rights Commission by amending the relevant law. ‘Some 89.5 per cent people opined that use police force for political purposes must be stopped and 77.9 per cent want police not to indulge in corruption by misusing power,’ the survey report said. Some 75 per cent respondents demanded that police had to be brought under accountability for rights violations and incidents like enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. The country needed a law-abiding, corruption and political influence free independent police to maintain law and order equally for the people irrespective of their identity, the survey said. The survey report is now available on the Police Reform Commission website (www.prc.mhapsd.gov.bd), according to a press release of the home ministry.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252767/changes-in-practice-of-interrogation-in-custody-sought
Sherpur district jail reopens after four months,"Sherpur district jail has reopened on a limited scale after remaining inactive for four months due to extensive damage caused on August 5. The jail received 13 inmates following court proceedings on Thursday, marking the resumption of its operations, said Sherpur district jail superintendent Md Shafiqul Alam on Friday. Sherpur chief judicial magistrate Md Sultan Mahmud inspected the jail before the reopening, along with other judicial officials. On August 5, miscreants broke into the prison, vandalised and set it on fire, looted case files and weapons, and facilitated the escape of 518 inmates. Jail superintendent Shafiqul Alam said that renovation work at the facility, carried out by the public works department, was 80 per cent complete. The allocated budget for the project stood at approximately Tk 1.6 crore. However, two preliminary tasks, including the installation of CCTV cameras, remained pending, he added. He also mentioned that the prison was made operational to reduce the inconvenience of transferring inmates to Jamalpur. ‘From now on, those arrested in both new and old cases will be brought to this prison,’ he added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252766/sherpur-district-jail-reopens-after-four-months
RU medical centre in sorry state,"Multiple problems including shortage of medicine, equipment, funding and inadequate professionals have rendered the lone Rajshahi University medical centre dysfunctional, limiting its services to the university students and teachers. At present, 22 out of 36 posts of doctors and four out of six technologists have been lying vacant at the medical centre for a long time, hampering its services badly, officials said. In addition, lack of three out of six posts of emergency medical officers and four out of six posts of nurses has forced the medical authorities to suspend its ‘afternoon services’, causing immense suffering to the students. Students alleged that they were mostly given pain killers or referred to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital while most of the doctors and technologists of the medical centre allegedly were not found in their respective chambers during office time. Saiful Islam, a third-year student of Islamic history and culture department, said that he went to the medical centre past week with breathing problems but the on-duty doctor prescribed two tablets of cold-related diseases without listening to his problem properly. According to officials, over forty medical tests including electrocardiogram, X-rays, and ultrasonography are available in the medical centre and most of these tests are provided to the students free and a few are at a nominal cost. Mafruha Siddiqa Lipi, chief medical officer of the university medical centre, said that the main obstacle to providing services was due to lack of necessary manpower. She said that the previous university authorities took a move in 2020 for recruiting 13 doctors and other necessary technologists and staff at the medical centre but the appointment got stuck due to some invisible reasons. ‘Whenever we approached the university administration in this regard, they only gave us assurances, but no visible effort was made to resolve the issue,’ she added. RU vice-chancellor professor Saleh Hasan Naqib said that they were trying to solve the existing problems to make the university medical centre fully operational. ‘We have started a process to recruit some doctors and staff so that emergency services can be ensured at the medical center,’ he said, hoping that a massive change in providing health services at the medical centre will be noticed about a month later. The RU authorities, meanwhile, have recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Popular Diagnostic Centre Ltd to get some discount for its teachers, officials, employees, and students on various medical tests.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252765/ru-medical-centre-in-sorry-state

China’s high-stakes economic agenda,"China’s leadership signalled a decisive shift towards bolstering economic growth and safeguarding stability in 2025, with key pledges for an expansive fiscal strategy and a moderately accommodative monetary policy. Meeting on December 9, chaired by President Xi Jinping, the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee outlined its economic and governance priorities. In a landscape fraught with global uncertainty, analysts see this as a calibrated response to stabilise the world’s second-largest economy. The policymakers underscored the need for robust macroeconomic measures to stimulate domestic consumption and drive technological innovation. Their strategy also included stabilising critical sectors like real estate and financial markets, reflecting a commitment to averting risks and mitigating external shocks. Apparently, China’s resolve goes beyond traditional frameworks, with promises to expand its policy arsenal, enhance countercyclical tools, and pursue better coordination among various policy levers. By sharpening the focus on targeted, forward-looking regulation, Beijing is seeking not just to recover but to invigorate its economic engine, ensuring resilience and vitality. This agenda also intertwines with a broader anticorruption campaign, suggesting an integrated approach to governance and economic management. As China enters a critical phase of recalibration, the message is clear: the leadership intends to harness every available instrument to fortify its domestic economic base and navigate an increasingly complex international environment. China’s pivot toward a ‘moderately loose monetary policy,’ its first such shift in over a decade, signals a bold recalibration aimed at steering the economy through mounting challenges. With potential rate cuts and reduced reserve requirements by the People’s Bank of China, Beijing seems prepared to unleash a suite of measures to reinvigorate growth in 2025. Alongside this, a more assertive fiscal policy hints at prioritising consumer spending and a recalibration of the beleaguered real estate sector. At the heart of this strategy lies a reaffirmation of the twin pillars of consumption and investment efficiency. Policymakers emphasised the urgency of broadening domestic demand, a move designed not merely to stabilise but to transform the economy into a more dynamic engine of growth. This transformation hinges, critically, on leveraging scientific and technological innovation to drive new productive capacities and cultivate a modern industrial framework. Yet the rhetoric of ambition does not stop there. China’s leadership is emphasising the importance of structural reforms and drastic measures to address entrenched inefficiencies in the economic system. These commitments reflect an acknowledgement that the road to resilience and modernisation demands nothing less than a comprehensive overhaul, aimed at reshaping the economic landscape for a precarious global future. China’s economy appears to be regaining its footing, showing a steady, if cautious, recovery after months of wide-reaching stimulus efforts from Beijing. The manufacturing sector’s official purchasing managers index edged up to 50.3 in November from 50.1 in October, marking its highest point in seven months and remaining safely above the expansion threshold. For a nation grappling with economic headwinds, these incremental gains signal a fragile but noteworthy rebound. The central plank of Beijing’s strategy lies in high-level economic openness. Policymakers are doubling down on stabilising foreign trade and investment flows, recognising their importance in driving sustained growth. This isn’t just about maintaining appearances on the global stage; it’s a pragmatic bid to keep the wheels of an export-driven economy turning. Yet, the ambitions don’t stop at macroeconomics. The Chinese leadership is also stressing the necessity of strong regional strategies, looking to unlock untapped potential across diverse provinces. Simultaneously, a green agenda is taking centre stage, with promises to balance carbon reduction, pollution control, and environmental expansion. China, it seems, is betting on a multipronged approach: steadying its domestic economy while projecting an image of progressiveness. Whether this balancing act succeeds remains to be seen, but the effort is unmistakable. China is leaning into a narrative of resilience and optimism as it charts the course for its economy in 2025. At a December 9 meeting, President Xi Jinping underscored the critical importance of bolstering public confidence, painting a picture of an economy buoyed by untapped potential and inherent resilience. His message was clear: while challenges persist, the fundamental drivers of growth and the economy’s long-term trajectory are firmly intact. This meeting, held days after a symposium that sought input from non-CPC voices, revealed the Party’s intent to project inclusivity and pragmatism in shaping its economic strategy. The leadership pledged to scale up efforts aimed at improving public well-being, emphasising a commitment to fostering a stronger sense of gain, happiness, and security among the population. Xi’s remarks carried an unmistakable urgency, calling for collective effort from the Party and society at large to achieve the year’s ambitious economic targets. The vision he outlined wasn’t just about steadying the ship — it was a rallying cry for renewal, resilience, and hard work. For China, managing the complexities of global turbulence and domestic pressures, this is a high-stakes bid to reaffirm stability and inspire a shared sense of purpose. China appears poised to embrace unconventional monetary strategies to navigate the mounting uncertainties of 2025, signalling a bold shift in its economic playbook. Observers speculate that measures such as substantial central bank purchases of government bonds and sharper cuts to interest rates and banks’ reserve requirements could form the backbone of this recalibrated approach. These steps align with policymakers’ growing resolve to inject potency into fiscal and monetary policy, warding off the spectre of a sharp economic downturn. The stakes are high. Strengthening fiscal stimulus is seen as pivotal for offsetting external pressures, including persistent tariff threats from the United States. Experts predict trillions of yuan in additional central government debt may be required to address housing market imbalances and expand social protections. Analysts also foresee cumulative interest rate cuts ranging from 30 to 40 basis points in 2025, with market-driven lending benchmarks potentially witnessing steeper declines. Notably, the December 9 meeting introduced the term ‘unconventional countercyclical adjustments’ to China’s policy lexicon, hinting at a coordinated effort to integrate monetary and fiscal strategies beyond traditional levers like rate cuts. This proactive posture suggests Beijing’s determination to maintain GDP growth at around 5 per cent, steering its economy through global turbulence with a mix of innovation and pragmatism.

The Paraguayan experience,"ABOUT 900 representatives from 120 member states of UNESCO Convention 2003 — the only global instrument to fight for the cause of the invaluable and yet continually declining elements of intangible cultural heritage from around the world — gathered at the grand hall of the Confederacion Sudamericano Futbol complex, popularly known as the CONMEBOL, Luque in the Paraguayan capital city of Asuncion in December 2–7 to witness the decision of the 18th session of the intangible cultural heritage intergovernmental committee’s annual meet to which Bangladesh is a member until 2026. Other than the 24 committee members, the states having nomination files on their cultural heritage elements on the table either to be considered for inscription in different categories like intangible cultural heritage in need of urgent safeguarding, the representative list of humanity, knowledge and skills sharing or transferring elements from one list to the other, attended the event with relevant government’s fullest support. Since becoming a signatory to the convention in 2003 and subsequent ratification in 2009, Bangladesh enjoys a number of inscriptions of this UN agency, including the latest rickshaw and rickshaw art in Dhaka. It is now working with the process as a committee member. It is a regular exercise for especially officials of the departments concerned. It is more so with members the Bangladesh permanent delegation to the UNESCO in Paris. But things are not as easy as that with the states who have not yet got any of their elements inscribed or only one with long struggling years to overcome. Albania, Ghana, Myanmar and Ukraine are a few such countries to name. Convention 2003 has the provision for its signatories to propose files for nomination on safeguarding intangible cultural heritage elements for sustainably promoting them both nationally and globally. Now, the answer to the question why it is important to safeguard the intangible cultural heritage elements of the states parties by UNESCO lies in the fact that the heritage elements of the world have been recently declared as the public good by UNESCO and their knowledge has been identified as beneficial for the well-being of the generations to come. For this reason, UNESCO, the apex agency on culture, does not only advocate for promotion of cultural products and practices all over the world but also intends to see that intergenerational knowledge transfer mechanism hinges on the responsible authorities efforts of sharing the tacit and explicit knowledge of relevant heritage bearers in educational institutes sustainably. A record 63 files were approved by the session, totalling the UNESCO inscribed elements and practices to reach 788 dispersed among 150 nations. What was more trend-setting with the committee this year is that it has agreed to a number of files on traditional food culture from across the countries of Europe, Asia the Pacific region and South America. Culinary traditions of Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand have most notably been taken to the international audiences by presenting and serving diets on the side events of the venue where people thronged to taste the delicacies offered and everybody relished the South Asian cuisines handed down from one generation to the other. The ways they were prepared and served are also marked with imprints of intergenerational skills and knowledge transfer equally matched with live narratives on the spot from the experienced, well trained voices from the tourism departments of the respective countries. And here, I picked up the twist of the things of Asian gastronomy. I wondered if a simple dish of a handful of steamed rice along with a pinch of fried, ground nuts and dried fish laced with some soya sauce served in a small boat-shaped wooden plate could go flagged in a UNESCO meet so frenziedly, then what about our Dhakai kacchi or mejbani from Chattogram or rasmalai of Cumilla? And what about hundreds of others scattered throughout the whole deltaic plain of ours? What do we lack in to making them global? It required nothing but some initiatives and we have every arrangement in terms of looking into those culinary dishes in our country. With the collaboration of the cultural affairs ministry, the Bangladesh Tourism Board and the Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation could easily prepare files to be submitted to the committee for its consideration long before. Before that to happen, the authority concerned — the political leadership, policymakers and policy advisers — have to visualise the possibility by themselves of the wider exploitation of this sector if they really mean to boost our tourism nationally and beyond. But if the civil aviation and tourism ministry and its two entities are of the view that observing International Tourism Day in a certain hotel premises and holding a food fair locally for a day or two are enough to usher in the global tour makers into the country, things will roll differently in days ahead. It is also understandable that some quarters of the authorities concerned are of the view that as an Islamic country, Bangladesh could not make our tourism vibe like those of Thailand, the Maldives or Singapore. Then, what about Indonesia and Malaysia? What about Saudi Arabia? Saudi Arabia has fixed its strategic goal to draw as many as 30 million Bangladeshi religion tourists by 2030. Are we more righteous than Muslims of those lands? Perhaps, we are yet to discover the link between a country’s tourism and economy that are layered, intertwined within the promotional efforts of our history, tradition and heritage. And culinary treasure of Bangladesh just offers another dimension to the whole affairs.

Revolution linguistics,"LINGUISTICS is the scientific study of languages. The scope of this field is very wide which can be understood from the large number of its branches. For example, sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics are two main subfields which study social (external) and psychological (internal) aspects of language respectively. Relatively newer branches are neurolinguistics and corpus linguistics: The former examines relationships between language and the structures and functions of the human brain while the latter is an empirical study of data on actual language use in different settings. In addition to these more established areas within linguistics, scholars have proposed newer understandings of language by combining linguistics and any subject of interest. The most notable example includes raciolinguistics which is a combination of race and linguistics. Raciolinguistics seeks to theorise how race shapes practices of language in different contexts. The association of language with race is indicated by concepts such as the ‘colour’ of language, linguistic whiteness and native-speaker ideology. Another addition to linguistics is religiolinguistics, a term that is modelled after raciolinguistics. A less known area, it examines how linguistics works in the context of religion. Perhaps the most interesting neologism is ‘petrolinguistics’ which was proposed by a British applied linguist with Pakistani heritage in a journal article published in 2005. A combination of ‘petroleum’ and ‘linguistics’, the term was used to theorise how the oil boom in the Gulf region generated significant linguistic activities. In fact, one approach to the applied study of language known as ‘English for specific purposes’ is often attributed to the petroleum industry in the Arab world. Following these older and newer branches and theories within linguistics, I would like to propose what I would call ‘revolulinguistics’. This is a marriage of ‘revolution’ and ‘linguistics’ and is inspired by the July 2024 Revolution in Bangladesh led by students and other young people which brought an end to Hasina’s 15-year autocratic regime. Revolulinguistics is a way of acknowledging the role of language and other semiotic resources in the movement and its outcome. Language played a unique role in the physical and virtual domains during the movement. Physically, the movement changed the urban linguistic geography in Dhaka and other cities and towns across the country. Graffities of different colours, shapes and sizes both in Bangla and English were written on the walls of public spaces everywhere. In the virtual domain, language took the form of — among other artefacts — memes of some of the protagonists of the revolution such as Abu Sayeed and Mir Mahfuzur Rahman Mugdho as well as its antagonists the most villainous of whom is fascist Hasina. Some of the virtual artefacts were replication of those in the physical space. Whether on the physical or virtual landscape, the aim of such linguistic creativity was to resist Hasina and her forces of oppression. The idea of revolulinguistics is not something entirely new. As language is at the centre of all human activities, scholars have examined the role of language in social movements and activism. For example, social media studies have demonstrated how movements in physical spaces are facilitated by the affordances of social media and how the physical and the virtual are coordinated to steer social and political movements forward. The July Revolution in Bangladesh is an exciting opportunity to claim a new frontier in the study of language and other semiotic tools. The revolution provides a minefield for researchers in sociolinguistics and other areas of language study who can examine how language plays its role in a digital world and what forms revolutions take in contemporary eras. Linguistic artworks on the walls around Dhaka University have turned the place into a linguistic museum for local and foreign tourists. Language and communication researchers can examine this open museum of language when theorising contemporary social and political movements from linguistic and discursive perspectives. On the first day of December 2024, BRAC Institute of Languages and four academic departments and institutes within the University of Dhaka co-hosted a seminar on the ‘Future of language education in the Global South: Challenges and possibilities’ in the Faculty of Social Sciences at the latter university. Four applied linguistics scholars from Australia, New Zealand and the United States spoke at the seminar. As the fourth speaker, I invited current and future applied linguistics and language education researchers in Bangladesh to explore new frontiers in research. I suggested that revolution linguistics could be one such new avenue. The audience of the seminar comprised mainly senior students in the departments of English and Linguistics and the Institutes of Modern Languages and Education and Research of the University of Dhaka. While colleagues from different higher education institutions also found themselves in the audience, I utilised my presentation to speak directly to the students. My aim was to point out what kind of applied linguistics research they were going to inherit in Bangladesh as they entered the discourse community as new members. Following this, I invited them to invest their researcher agency and imagination to advance the inherited research culture. I noted that while the socio-political context at the global level would disappoint the students as researchers given the Israeli genocide in Gaza and the West-sponsored wars in different regions, the local Bangladeshi context was somewhat more optimistic. This was mainly due to the ouster of Hasina through the student movement which was a recognition of youth freedom, creativity and leadership. Such an environment was conducive to utilising various epistemological resources including theories of, from and by the global South and pursuing strategic research to address language education challenges and possibilities in Bangladesh and other South societies. I also noted that while the students were free to explore the field and take it to any direction that they would like, the July Revolution was something that they could examine from (socio)linguistic and semiotic perspectives to inaugurate the new domain of revolution linguistics. I can’t be sure how convincing I was in my argument or what impact my invitation will have on the students and emerging researchers in the audience. However, I am optimistic that the idea will be given some deep thinking by some members of the language research community in Bangladesh. Some colleagues have already taken steps in researching revolution linguistics. I had the opportunity to talk to one academic from BRAC University who was deeply motivated in researching the linguistics of the July Revolution. He shared with me his ambition that he would take at least one thousand photos of the graffities and slogans written on the walls in different locations around the Dhaka University campus wearing the shoes of an ethnographer. He said that he was still haunted by the memories of police brutalities at his university. His active involvement in the movement worked as a catalyst for his enthusiasm about revolution linguistics. I won’t be surprised if more colleagues are already heading in that direction to claim revolution linguistics as a new frontier of research in post-revolution Bangladesh.

India’s playing around minority issues,"India and Bangladesh held a foreign office consultation on December 9. This has been the first high-level meeting since India suffered a huge setback at the overthrow of prime minister Sheikh Hasina on August 5. The political changeover created a complex diplomatic gamut, pushing the relationship between Bangladesh and India to its low. The foreign office consultation being a structured meeting, its scope was limited. Nevertheless, in the context of strained relationship resulting from the political changeover, the meeting created much hype, curiosity and speculation. The focus trickled down to seeing how India uses the consultation to shore up the damage created after the political changeover and put it back on track to move towards a positive direction. After the meeting, foreign secretaries of both the countries held separate press conferences. India’s foreign secretary at the press conference said that India supports a democratic, stable, peaceful, progressive and inclusive Bangladesh and willing to build a positive and constructive relationship based on mutual trust and respect and mutual sensitivity to each other’s concern and interests. The foreign secretary said that India’s development cooperation and multifaceted engagements with Bangladesh, including in areas of connectivity, trade, power, energy and capacity building, are all geared towards benefits of the people of Bangladesh. The Indian official’s statement contradicted the reality of the past and, hence, it was filled with more of diplomatic rhetoric. India did not support a democratic Bangladesh. It, rather, promoted undemocratic practices in the past 15 years. Bangladesh welcomes a relationship based on mutual respect whereas India wants a relationship on its dictated terms. The Indian foreign secretary emphasised a people-centric relationship, but it did not value the people and people’s government but a partisan government of its choice. Since the political changeover, India took a couple of actions such as limiting consular services where people became victims, allowing a free fall of disinformation from Indian media against Bangladesh, etc. The Indian foreign secretary also conveyed India’s concern about the safety and welfare of minorities although India knows it well that large or small, all communities in Bangladesh were enjoying religious freedom and the rights and privileges of a bona fide citizen. He has also raised concern about some incidents of attacks on cultural, religious and diplomatic properties. The minority card was his important talking point on the table during the consultation. India has been playing the minority card from the day the political changeover took place in Bangladesh. India taking cognisance of series of disinformation from Indian media expressed concern about the security of minorities in Bangladesh. The persecution of minorities in India has been an everyday affair since the anti-Muslim riot in Gujarat in 2002 which left more than 1,000 people dead. Genocide Watch called the incident the ‘the 2002 Gujarat genocidal massacres’ in its report published in 2023. Even the Hindus are not safe in India. Higher caste Hindus discriminating and maltreating lower caste Hindus is an everyday affair. Bangladesh’s foreign secretary at the press conference rightly said that ‘the government of Bangladesh expected no interference in the country’s internal matter as we do not make any comments on the internal matter of other countries. We expect the same from others.’ Dhaka also raised concern about the misinformation and disinformation around minority issues by a section of the Indian media. This has a damaging impact on people-to-people relations. It was essential for the Indian government to stop media propaganda to support a ‘stable Bangladesh.’ India’s play over the minority issue is embarrassing the Hindus in Bangladesh and harming their dignity. The minority card against Bangladesh is the agenda of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a Hindu extremist organisation, which is the ideological mentor of the Bharatiya Janata Party. This organisation is extremely intolerant of Muslims not only in India but the Muslims all over the world, in general, and South Asia, in particular. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was founded in Nagpur, India, in 1925. ‘During the colonial period, the RSS collaborated with the British and played no role in the Indian Independence…. It was banned in 1947 for four days and then thrice by the post-independence Indian government, first in 1948 when Nathuram Godse a member of the RSS assassinated Mahatma Gandhi, then during the emergency (1975–1977) and for a third time after the demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992…. The RSS has been criticised as an extremist organisation and there is a scholarly consensus that it spreads hatred and promotes violence’ (Wikipedia). The Gujarat massacre 2002 is a notorious testimony of the RSS extremism. The Gujarat riot followed by a India-wide anti Muslim persecution turned the table in favour of the Bharatiya Janata Party. During the Gujarat massacre, ‘the chief minister of Gujarat was Narendra Modi, a lifelong member of the Hindu extremist RSS’ (Genocide Watch). The BJP government came to power with the support of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh with a delicate election results in 2024, making it more dependent on this extremist Hindu organisation for a political survival. The BJP government cannot ignore Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh agenda in Bangladesh because of the leadership’s deep association with the organisation and political dependence and it, therefore, cannot forego inventing minority issues in Bangladesh to keep the domestic audience rallying behind the Bharatiya Janata Party. As India plays the minority card, there is a greater risk of people on either side of the border becoming acrimonious much against the interests of both Bangladesh and India. However, India’s persistent attempts at inventing minority issues in Bangladesh could have a geopolitical motivation to offset its territorial weakness.

Honouring martyred intellectuals,"The liberation war remains a defining moment in Bangladesh’s history, a struggle not only for territorial independence but also for cultural and intellectual freedom. Among the countless sacrifices made in the period, the calculated extermination of the nation’s intellectuals stands out as a heinous crime. On December 14, 1971, in the waning days of the war, the Pakistani occupation forces and their collaborators — Razakar, Al Badr, and Al Shams — systematically abducted, tortured and executed more than 200 intellectuals, including teachers, writers, physicians, engineers and cultural activists. This targeted genocide was not random. It was a calculated move to cripple the the nascent nation intellectually, thereby hindering its progress for decades to come. Before delving into consequences of the atrocity, it is crucial to understand why the intellectuals were targeted. The role of intellectuals in the socio-political awakening of the erstwhile East Pakistan, which became Bangladesh through the war, was monumental. During the two decades leading up to 1971, the individuals served as the conscience of the nation, actively resisting the oppressive policies of the Pakistani military rulers. The language movement of 1952 was the first major instance where intellectuals emerged as torch-bearers of resistance. Writers, educators and activists galvanised public sentiment, emphasising the cultural and linguistic identity of Bengalis in the face of the imposition of Urdu by the sate. This movement laid the groundwork for the eventual demand for autonomy and independence. In the 1960s, as political unrest grew, intellectuals continued to play a vital role in shaping public opinions. They used literature, art and education to expose the systemic exploitation of East Pakistan by the West Pakistani elite. Universities, particularly the University of Dhaka, became hubs of political activism where teachers and students alike challenged the status quo. Intellectuals wrote articles, gave speeches and organised cultural programmes that highlighted the economic disparity, political marginalisation and cultural suppression imposed by the West Pakistani rulers. Their contributions were not limited to academic discussions, They actively engaged with the masses, awakening a collective consciousness that culminated in the historic Six-Point Movement led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. This movement, often described as the blueprint for independence, would not have gained such traction without the intellectual support that translated complex political ideas into language accessible to ordinary people. The Pakistani military understood the pivotal role that these individuals played in mobilising resistance. By eliminating them, they hoped to decapitate the leadership that could guide an independent Bangladesh. The massacre on December 14 was not only an act of vengeance. It was also a strategic attempt at rendering the nation intellectually bankrupt. Tragically, the plan partially succeeded. The immediate aftermath of independence saw Bangladesh grappling with a void in intellectual leadership that has persisted in various forms to this day. In the years after independence, the intellectual community faced numerous challenges. While some continued to work towards rebuilding the nation, many were either silenced by political divisions or co-opted by the ruling elite. The moral authority that the intellectuals once wielded began to erode as some prioritised personal gain over public services. This disillusionment deepened as universities, once centres of critical thinking and activism, became mired in mediocrity, corruption and political interference. Student unions, which had historically played a significant role in political movements, were suppressed, further stifling intellectual growth. Today, the young generation finds it increasingly difficult to trust or rely on the intellectual class. The reasons for this disconnection are manifold. First, the current intellectuals often appear detached from the realities faced by ordinary citizens. Unlike their predecessors, who actively engaged with the masses, many of today’s intellectuals operate within insular academic or political circles. Second, the lack of moral courage among some intellectuals has alienated the youth. Instead of challenging falsehood or standing up against injustice, many remain silent or complicit, prioritising personal security or political alignment over truth and justice. Moreover, the young generation, shaped by the rapid globalisation of knowledge and culture, often questions the relevance of traditional intellectual figures. In an era of social media and instant information, they are more likely to seek inspiration from global leaders or grass-roots activists than from local academics or cultural icons who fail to resonate with their aspirations and concerns. This shift underscores the need for intellectuals to adapt to the changing dynamics of influence and engagement. However, this raises an essential question: who should be considered an intellectual? According to a global perspective, intellectuals are not merely individuals with advanced degrees or prestigious titles. They are leaders who challenge prevailing norms, advocate justice and contribute to societal progress through their ideas and action. Intellectuals bridge the gap between knowledge and application, offering solutions to real-world problems while inspiring others to think critically and act ethically. In this context, the martyred intellectuals of 1971 stand as the ideal example. They were not only scholars but also activists, deeply committed to the welfare of their people. To honour their legacy and rebuild the nation’s intellectual soul, Bangladesh must take several steps. First, the education system requires urgent reforms. A unified, inclusive curriculum that emphasises critical thinking, history and ethics is essential to cultivating the next generation of intellectuals. Universities must reclaim their role as centres of excellence, free of political interference and corruption. Second, the contributions of the martyred intellectuals should be preserved and promoted through museums, archives and educational programmes. Their stories must inspire future generations to value intellectualism as a cornerstone of national development. Additionally, the intellectual community must renew its commitment to moral leadership. This involves challenging injustice, advocating marginalised voices and engaging with the public in meaningful ways. By doing so, they can regain the trust and respect of the younger generation. Finally, fostering a culture of unity and secularism, as envisioned by the martyred intellectuals, is crucial to overcoming the divisions that have hindered national progress. The massacre of the intellectuals in 1971 was an attempt at destroying the very soul of Bangladesh. While their loss remains an irreparable tragedy, their legacy offers a road map for rebuilding the nation. By emulating their courage, vision and commitment to justice, Bangladesh can honour their sacrifices and work towards realising the dream of a prosperous, equitable and intellectually vibrant nation.

Effective steps needed to regain customer trust in NBFIs,"A LACK of customer trust in non-bank financial institutions has resulted in a decline in deposits and deposit accounts. Deposits in NBFIs fell, as the Bangladesh Bank says, to Tk 47,838 crore in the July–September from Tk 47,906 crore in the previous quarter. The number of deposit accounts has also decreased to 3.87 lakh by September, down from 4.31 lakh by December 2023 and 4.47 lakh in September 2023, suggesting a continued loss of depositors. NBFI loan disbursements have, as a result, also declined. In July-September, the NBFIs also experienced a 28 per cent decline in loan recovery. The situation suggests that the NBFIs, mired in widespread irregularities, lack of democratic governance and abnormally high defaulted loans during the Awami League’s tenure, have ways to go and steps to take to regain depositor’s confidence. The NBFIs appear to be suffering the most from high defaulted loans, with a third of the sector’s total loans having been defaulted. The Bangladesh Bank says that the total amount of defaulted loans in NBFIs soared to Tk 24,711 crore in June from Tk 19,951 crore a year ago while the total outstanding loan amount increased to Tk 74,533 crore. Most of the 35 non-bank financial institutions are in crisis, with some having more than 90 per cent of the outstanding loans in default. Keeping to a 2023 Bangladesh Bank report, People’s Leasing and Financial Services is burdened with 99.62 per cent defaulted loans, followed by Bangladesh Finance and Investment Co with 96.90 per cent, Fareast Finance with 94.25 per cent, International Leasing and Finance with 90.93 per cent and First Finance with 89.63 per cent. With such levels of defaulted loans, the NBFIs suffer from a liquidity crisis and trust deficit. Such a level of defaulted loans in the NBFIs has been caused by massive irregularities where non-deserving and, at times, shell companies managed to receive large loans. Irregularities, for example, prompted the government to initiate a liquidation process for People’s Leasing and Financial Services, from which PK Halder and his associates embezzled billions, in 2019, which was later scrapped and steps were taken to revive the entity on a court order. The Bangladesh Bank earlier asked the NBFIs to identify wilful defaulters and take action against them. But there has been no satisfactory progress. When NBFIs continue to remain at the forefront of driving new investments in other Asian countries, poor governance and widespread irregularities have turned the NBFIs in Bangladesh precarious. The central bank and NBFI managers should, therefore, attend to the high rate of loan defaults, lack of internal governance, deficiency in risk management and absence of long-term sources of liquidity to revive the sector. Given that the sector is large enough to impact the economy, the central bank needs to effectively regulate the sector.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/252732/effective-steps-needed-to-regain-customer-trust-in-nbfis
"Apology is but admission, legal action should follow","THE Rapid Action Battalion — pulled together with police, army and air force personnel and border guards as an elite force to improve law and order — having offered a public apology for extrajudicial killing, involuntary disappearances and all other misdeeds is but an admission of the crimes that the force had perpetrated since its inception in 2004 until now. And, the admission warrants that legal action should be forthcoming. The director general of the force, who is an additional inspector general of the police, at a press conference at the battalion’s media centre in Dhaka on December 12 apologised on behalf of the force to the victims and the families of the victims who the force had tortured and harmed since the force’s establishment. Rights organisation Ain O Salish Kendra lists 3,973 people to have been killed in events officially termed as ‘gun fights’, ‘encounters’, ‘crossfires’ or even ‘gangland infighting’ between January 2004 and June 2024. Of them, as the rights group says, 1,286 people were killed in gun fights with the battalion while the accused were held in custody. The rights group also blames the battalion and the police jointly for the killing of 94 people in the period. The inquiry commission on enforced disappearances that the government instituted on August 27 to investigate involuntary disappearances and extrajudicial killing that took place between January 2010 and August 5 this year and the secret detention centres on November 5 said that it had received complaints of disappearances of more than 1,600 victims having happened in the 15 years of the authoritarian regime of the Awami League, toppled in a mass uprising on August 5. About 200 of the victims are reported to be still missing. The battalion’s director general at the press conference has expressed commitment that the force would run with transparency and integrity to win public trust, noting that 16 battalion personnel have been arrested on charges of their involvement in crimes such as extortion, drug-related offences and robbery after the August 5 political changeover. But the admission is not enough. The director general of the force, who has given an assurance that the battalion personnel would not get involved in crimes, has also said that only holding the perpetrators in the agency to justice through credible investigation of the allegations could redeem the force as an institution. While it is imperative that the government should stop using the battalion, or any law enforcement units for that matter, in work beyond law enforcement in partisan interests, it should purge the battalion, any law enforcement units, of the people having been tainted. The government should, therefore, look into the allegations of crimes against the battalion personnel, credibly investigate the incidents and hold to account anyone who work, or worked, in the unit for crimes they are, or were, responsible for. Anyone found guilty of command responsibility for the crimes should not be spared. Besides, the government should make reforms or change the governing rules for the unit to stop from getting involved in crimes or misdeeds and to stop it from being used in partisan interests.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/252731/apology-is-but-admission-legal-action-should-follow
