Resolve land issues to execute CHT treaty: seminar,"Speakers, including policymakers and government officials, on Monday emphasised the need to resolve land-related issues in the Chittagong Hill Tracts for the effective implementation of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Accord, signed 27 years ago. They made the observation at a seminar titled ‘The Chittagong Hill Tracts Accord: Transforming Harmony into Prosperity’, organised by the Ministry of CHT Affairs at the CHT Complex on Bailey Road in the city to commemorate the 27th anniversary of the signing of the accord. They emphasised priorotising the need to resolve land-related issues, a critical concern for the hill people who primarily depend on land for their livelihoods, by activating the CHT Land Dispute Resolution Commission formed in 1999. They also blamed ineffectiveness of the bodies formed under the CHT accord for delaying the full execution of the treaty, signed between the then Awami League government and the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti on December 2, 1997 to restore peace and civic rights in the three hill districts-- Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachari. Addressing the event as chief guest, CHT affairs ministry adviser Supradip Chakma said that the bodies were not functioning effectively as corresponding laws and regulations required for their operation had not been formulated. ‘Formulating corresponding laws and regulations [for the bodies] is crucial, and the CHT affairs ministry has been working on this issue,’ he said. He further said that the ministry had been working on appointing chairperson to the CHT Land Dispute Resolution Commission and planned to discuss the appointment of three members to the CHT Accord Implementation and Monitoring Committee, as well as the formation of the advisory committee for the CHT affairs ministry with land adviser AF Hasan Arif. Jahangirnagar University history department professor Mohammad Mozahidul Islam, who presented the keynote speech, said that although 65 out of 72 clauses of the accord were implemented by previous governments, the only obstacle that remained was the land issue. The speakers said that the delay in the treaty’s execution was increasing uncertainty of the national minorities in the hill districts. They also stressed incorporating the CHT issues into the interim government’s action plan. CHT affairs ministry secretary AKM Shamimul Huq Siddique presided over the event, where Nilo Kumar Tanchangya, councillor of the CHT Regional Council and Sudatta Chakma, chairman of the Chittagong Hill Tribal Refugee Task Force also spoke, among others.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251846/resolve-land-issues-to-execute-cht-treaty-seminar
Anti-India platform for referendum to decide AL’s right to do politics,"An anti-India platform named ‘people of Bangladesh’ on Monday gave a seven-point demand, including one to decide Awami League’s legitimacy to do politics through a referendum. Masud Jakaria, on behalf of a platform named ‘Bangladesher Jonogon,’ came up with the demand at a press conference at Dhaka Reporters Unity in the capital. Abu Mustafiz, spokesperson of the organisation, also presented a written statement at the press conference, saying that their movement was against Indian dominance. The demands include Awami League and its associates allegedly responsible for all the enforced disappearances, murders, corruption and injustice perpetrated during the past fascist regime must be brought to justice. Another of their demands is the president’s resignation and formulation of a new constitution to ensure people’s empowerment. To that end a constituent assembly has to be formed and the new constitution must be finalised through a referendum. They also demanded a ‘Truth and reconciliation commission’ to stop the rehabilitation of the fascists. Necessary reforms must be carried out in the army and civil administration. Every individual who fired at the protesters and those who ordered the shooting during July-August mass uprising must be brought to justice. Condemning organisations, including Prothom Alo, Daily Star, Udichi and Chhayanaut as pro-India acting as the gateway for Delhi in Bangladesh, they demanded that these organisations must make their income and expenditure for the past 20 years public. They also condemned the elections of 2014, 2018 and 2024 as farce and demanded declaration that these polls were illegal and also demanded trial of those who were involved in these illegal elections. On November 22, the organisation held a sit-in programme for several days in front of Prothom Alo and The Daily Star offices, condemning them as ‘agents of India’. On November 24, at least 10 protesters were injured when the police baton-charged to disperse the protesters from in front of the Prothom Alo office in Dhaka.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/251845/anti-india-platform-for-referendum-to-decide-als-right-to-do-politics

Manik Bandopadhyay’s death anniv today,"Today is the 68th anniversary of death of novelist, short story writer Manik Bandopadhyay, who is often considered as one of the finest writers in modern Bangla literature. Born on May 19, 1908 at Dumka, a small town in Santal Parganas of Bihar, in British India, Manik Bandopadhyay enriched Bangla literary treasure trove penning 34 novels and more than 250 short stories. Influenced by Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Carl Gustav Jung, and Adler, Manik Bandopadhyay’s magnum opus titled Padmanadir Majhi sheds light on the lives of poor fishermen such as Kuber, Dhananjoy, and Ganesh’s  piggishness, treachery and helplessness countered by hopes, aspirations, and sometimes seconds of joy and love. The novel also focuses that the money they get does not certainly come proximately in return for the fish. But they do not protest due to poverty. Kuber’s secret life of weaving dreams around his cheerful sister-in-law, Kapila, the mysterious and powerful Hossain Mian, enticing the unwary to his Maynadwip, among others, still make readers think a lot about the novel. Written on the context of love, estrangement, envy and mutual sympathy of a decaying society, Putul Nacher Itikatha, the third novel of the fiction writer, a humble protest against the people who have a tendency to play with the lives of humans as if they were puppets, is also regarded as one of the masterworks of Bangla literature.

"Sharmin, Jannatul return to T20 squad against Ireland","Sharmin Akter returned to the T20I squad after two years, while Jannatul Ferdus made a comeback after last playing for the country in 2018, as the Bangladesh Cricket Board announced the squad for the first two T20Is of the three-match series against Ireland on Monday. Sharmin also returned to the 50-over format in the just-concluded ODI series against Ireland, where she was the highest scorer with 211 runs and received two player of the match awards. The top-order batter last played in T20Is in December 2022, against New Zealand. On the other hand, off-spinner Jannatul got dropped after representing Bangladesh in only three matches, two in ODIs and one in T20Is, and as a result, moved to Australia six years back. Recently she returned to the country and played in the domestic circuit. According to the chief selector of the women’s wing, Sazzad Ahmed, she got picked in place of another off-spinner, Sultana Khatun, who has been rested. Pacer Marufa Khatun has also been given a break to manage her workloads. Twenty-two-year-old left-arm pacer Fariha Islam Trishna will take her place. Left-arm spinner Sanjida Akter was also recalled.

Bangladesh women clean sweep Ireland,"Farzana Haque hit her third consecutive fifty while Sharmin Akter smashed a blistering 72 off 88 balls as the Bangladesh women’s team beat Ireland by seven wickets in the third and final ODI to secure a 3-0 clean sweep at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Monday. The duo put on a record partnership of 143 runs as the hosts stormed to 186-3 in 37.3 overs, after Ireland were bundled out for 185 in 50 overs. This was only the third time that Bangladesh has swept an opponent in an ODI series. They also took all six ICC Championship points available from the series and boosted their chances of directly qualifying for the next year’s World Cup in India. Batting first, Ireland were bowled out for below 200 for the second match running. Six of the Irish batters got a start, but only captain Gaby Lewis (52) could score a fifty. All the wickets were taken by the spinners, with Fahima Khatun being the peak of the bowlers with three. Pacer Marufa Akter was concussed while fielding and was replaced by Ritu Moni. Both of them were wicketless. In reply, Murshida Khatun fell cheaply in the fifth over of the innings. But Farzana and Sharmin kept Ireland frustrated for a long time. Their partnership is the highest for Bangladesh for any wicket in ODIs. None of them, though, could push for a hundred as Sharmin fell in the 33rd over while Farzana followed her team-mate one over later after scoring 61 off 99. Captain Nigar Sultana Joty and Sobhana Mostary then took the hosts home comfortably. Sharmin, who hit a record 211 runs for Bangladesh in the series and was named player of the match, thanked Bangladesh men’s team current senior assistant coach Mohammad Salahuddin for his support when she was outside the national squad. ‘He’s been supporting me since my childhood. Maybe it’s for their support that I’m still playing cricket,’ said Sharmin of Salahuddin. ‘I’ve been preparing for where my weaknesses were, where I wasn’t doing good,’ she added. ‘Now I’ve returned to the national team and performed. It felt good.’ Meanwhile, Farzana, who was also adjudged player of the series, mentioned that her work ethic paid off. ‘I’ve had that eagerness of playing long innings. My determination is strong too. I believe that I can play long innings,’ said Farzana. ‘Of course I’ll have to practice playing shots. Because you’ve got to score runs too, not only play for long’, the opener added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251836/bangladesh-women-clean-sweep-ireland-
Safe water and sanitation for all,"THE world is facing a serious water crisis, with 26 per cent of the global population still lacking access to safe drinking water, and a staggering 46 per cent are deprived of basic sanitation facilities. These alarming statistics, revealed in the UN World Water Development Report 2023, serve as a grim reminder of how far we are from achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6, which aims to ensure safe water and sanitation for all by 2030. While this goal is part of the broader Sustainable Development Goals, the reality paints a stark contrast, leaving millions vulnerable to preventable diseases and hardships. The global crisis is mirrored within Bangladesh, where similar challenges continue to undermine public health and dignity.  Access to safer water at schools WITHIN our borders, the situation mirrors this grim reality. A 2022 survey by UNICEF and the World Health Organisation exposed the harsh reality faced by schoolchildren in Bangladesh. Over three million children lack access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation in schools, putting 8.5 million students at significant health risks. To make matters worse, nearly 19 per cent of schools have no access to clean water, and 7 per cent operate without any water, sanitation, or hygiene facilities. Imagine how these gaps impact young learners’ health, dignity, and education! The lack of separate toilets for boys and girls in 43 per cent of schools further perpetuates gender inequality, while the absence of basic hygiene measures, like handwashing with soap, in 44 per cent of schools highlights an urgent need for better infrastructure and awareness. A Somoy TV report earlier this year painted a grim picture, revealing that most schools in Pirojpur still grapple with inadequate water and sanitation facilities.  Need for stronger infrastructure THESE challenges highlight the urgent need for stronger policy frameworks and more robust implementation of existing ones. The National Water Policy of Bangladesh, enacted in 1999, aimed to ensure safe water access for all by 2025. However, despite its well-intentioned goals, the policy’s implementation has been slow due to several critical challenges: Funding gaps: The lack of consistent funding for water infrastructure projects, especially in rural areas, means that many areas still lack the necessary resources for clean water and sanitation systems. Lack of enforcement: There are significant gaps in enforcing water quality standards and sanitation regulations, particularly in informal settlements and rural schools. Limited focus on rural areas: While urban areas like Dhaka see some improvements in water access, rural and remote regions are often left behind. For SDG-6 to be achieved by 2030, the government must not only enforce existing policies but also focus on strengthening institutional coordination, improving funding, and investing in sustainable infrastructure, especially in rural schools and underserved areas. A comprehensive approach should include collaboration with local authorities, NGOs, and international organizations. For example, the Water Supply and Sanitation Policy must integrate specific goals for rural water systems and school sanitation facilities. Public-private partnerships must also be prioritised, particularly to address the infrastructure gaps in rural schools. By engaging businesses in the effort to improve access to safe water and sanitation, the government can leverage resources to create more robust systems for the long term.  Role of awareness THIS issue is not just about the government — it’s something we all need to take responsibility for. A big part of the problem lies in a lack of awareness, both individually and collectively. Take Rahman Mollah, for instance, a press worker in Dhaka’s Bangla Bazar. When asked about the water he drinks, his response was eye-opening: ‘Yes, we have water to drink, but we never really think about where it comes from or whether it’s safe.’ When it came to sanitation, his view was just as concerning: ‘We have a sanitation system here, and everyone at the presses uses it. Since so many people use it, it seems like it’s working fine. But whether it’s actually healthy or proper, we don’t really know. We just assume it’s enough for us and don’t expect much more.’ Rahman’s words reveal a troubling truth — a lack of awareness and concern that many people share. This indifference contributes to the neglect of basic needs like clean water and proper sanitation. Changing this mindset is crucial. Raising awareness, alongside strong government policies, can help shift our thinking and create accountability at every level — so that everyone, from individuals to policymakers, understands the importance of clean water and sanitation.  Health risks and waterborne diseases THE health implications are devastating. Waterborne diseases continue to wreak havoc across the country, with Madaripur reporting a sharp rise in cases in October 2024, worsened by seasonal floods. These local issues mirror a global crisis—every year, 1.5 million people worldwide are affected by waterborne diseases, with 842,000 losing their lives prematurely. Among them, diarrhoea alone claims the lives of nearly 395,000 children under five annually. For the past 20 years, over 900 families in Tahirpur, Sunamganj, have been suffering from a lack of clean drinking water. They have to travel 1.5 kilometres over hilly terrain to collect water. Due to the scarcity of clean water, they have been facing difficulties and have to rely on traditional methods to collect, purify, and drink water from far away. In Dhaka, the situation is even more alarming with rapidly depleting groundwater levels, which drop by 2-3 meters annually, exacerbating concerns about water shortages and flood risks. Alarmingly, studies have shown that one-third of Bangladesh’s water sources exceed WHO’s manganese standards, and 41 per cent of people consume water laced with faecal matter. E. coli bacteria, a major culprit behind diarrhoea, has also been detected in one-third of urban households’ water supplies.  Hidden danger of PFAS chemicals A RECENT report by the Environment and Social Development Organisation unveiled another alarming threat — PFAS chemicals in Dhaka’s water sources. Known as ‘forever chemicals’ because they don’t break down easily, these toxins seep into water supplies through everyday items like non-stick cookware, firefighting foam, and even cosmetics. PFAS exposure has been linked to serious health issues, including cancer, hormone disruptions, complications during pregnancy, and even a weakened response to vaccines. Immediate action is necessary to regulate and remove these harmful chemicals from our water sources.  Looking ahead: what can we do? THE clock is ticking — 2030 is fast approaching, with only a little over five years left to achieve these goals. Achieving SDG-6 will require coordinated efforts from grassroots awareness campaigns to robust government policies. Industries, schools, and communities must join hands to create a healthier, safer future. We must raise awareness about the importance of clean water, proper sanitation, and hygiene practices like handwashing. Schools, local leaders, and the media all have a vital role in spreading the word and creating change. But awareness alone isn’t enough; we also need to engage with our communities, encouraging everyone to take responsibility for their water sources and sanitation facilities while promoting education and regular upkeep. The government also needs to invest in better infrastructure, especially in rural areas and schools, to ensure safe drinking water and separate toilets for boys and girls. Additionally, we must push for stronger policies that prioritise water safety, sanitation, and the removal of harmful chemicals like PFAS from our water sources. Only through these collective efforts can we ensure that clean, safe water and sanitation are available to everyone by 2030.

Seales’ 4-5 prolongs Tigers’ batting woes,"Jayden Seales bowled a record-breaking spell of four wickets for five runs in 15.5 overs to cripple Bangladesh as the visitors were folded for 164 runs by the West Indies in the first innings on the second day of the second Test at Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica, on Sunday. This was for the seventh time in the last 10 innings that Bangladesh have failed to reach 200 runs in an innings of a Test. Bangladesh bowlers, however, asked some difficult questions but couldn’t reap many rewards as the Caribbean side ended the day on 70-1. Express pacer Nahid Rana bowled a fiery spell where he clocked 150kph but managed to take the sole wicket of opener Mykile Louis. Shadman Islam and Shahadat Hossain began the second day positively for Bangladesh after the rain-curtailed opening day. Shamar Joseph broke the partnership on the ninth over of the morning when Shahadat was squared up to get clean bowled. Then the inevitable collapse happened as the Tigers slipped to 98-6 from 83-2. Shamar Joseph scalped Jaker Ali and Shadman before Seales dismissed Liton Das. Shadman, who got to his fifty on the first day, fell for 64 when he nicked one outside off. So the wait for almost two years to see a Bangladesh opener getting a century continues. The left-hander, though, realised that his wicket cost the team the match. ‘Unfortunately, I couldn’t make it big,’ Shadman said after the second day’s play. ‘If I could go on, it would have been better for the team. I hope that I will do better in the next innings.’ A seventh-wicket partnership of 41 runs off 116 deliveries between Mehidy and Taijul Islam kept the West Indies at bay for a while. After Alzaarri Joseph broke the stand by dismissing Taijul, Seales achieved the record feat. His bowling figure of 15.5-10-5-4 is the most economical among the pacers in history with at least 90 deliveries being bowled. His figure stands second overall according to the same parameter. With the new ball getting movement and the pitch offering some turn and bounce, Bangladesh bowlers didn’t let the West Indies batters score freely. Left-handed spinner Taijul bowled seven maidens out of his 10 but remained wicketless. Captain Kraigg Brathwaite (33*), who earlier survived an lbw call via DRS, saw the day out with Keacy Carty (19*). Shadman believed that Bangladesh could make a comeback if they continued to bowl well. ‘Though the wickets fell quickly, if we bowl well, then we can make a comeback. And if we score some runs, then it will be helpful,’ he said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251832/seales-4-5-prolongs-tigers-batting-woes-
Govt reforms body to amend labour act,"The interim government has restructured the tripartite committee to draft proposed amendments to the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006, aligning it with recommendations from global stakeholders, including the International Labour Organisation. The labour ministry on November 27 issued a gazette notification in this regard, abolishing the previous one issued on September 20, 2022. The 17-member committee included 11 government officials from the ministries of labour, commerce, textiles and jute, and industries, along with three representatives from each of employers and workers groups. The ministry directed the committee to prepare and submit the draft amendments to the labour act to the labour secretary but did not specify a deadline for submission. Labour secretary AHM Shafiquzzaman announced at a recent press conference that Bangladesh was committed to introducing further amendments to the labour act by March next year, following its last revision in 2018. He said that this commitment was made during the 352nd session of the International Labour Organisation governing body held in Geneva from October 28 to November 7. At the 108th session of the ILO in mid-June 2019, labour representatives from Italy, Japan, South Africa, Pakistan and Brazil called for an inquiry commission against the government of Bangladesh. Bangladesh was accused of failing to uphold ILO conventions, specifically Convention 87 on freedom of association and the right to organise, Convention 98 on the right to organise and collective bargaining and Convention 81 on labour inspection. The complainants also proposed forming a commission of inquiry to address these alleged violations. In response, the ILO, in November 2020, asked Bangladesh to develop a time-bound roadmap to resolve the issues raised by the complainants. Bangladesh subsequently prepared a roadmap focusing on four priority areas, each with specific actions aligned to a timeline: labour law reform, trade union registration, labour inspection and enforcement, and addressing anti-union discrimination, unfair labour practices and violence against workers. The European Union and the United States have also urged Bangladesh to amend its labour law by easing trade union rules, simplifying trade union registration processes and reducing the worker threshold required to form a union.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/251830/govt-reforms-body-to-amend-labour-act
SMEs hamstrung by limited access to finance over past decade,"Limited access to finance has been one of the major challenges for small and medium enterprises over the past decade in Bangladesh, as banks generally favour larger and well-established companies in the country, according to the draft White Paper on the State of Bangladesh Economy submitted to chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on Sunday. The white paper submitted by a 12-member committee headed by economist Debapriya Bhattacharya observed that SMEs faced difficulties in conducting operations in the intricate regulatory environment. It said that the complex regulations included cumbersome and bureaucratic licensing procedures, inconsistent application of rules and lack of supporting government agencies. It mentioned that lack of supporting government agencies made it quite difficult for the smaller businesses to scale up. Md Ali Zaman, president of the Small and Medium Enterprises Owners Association of Bangladesh, said that only certain groups, who were already well off, received the benefit of business financing in the country. ‘Not only banks, same thing happened with government financing,’ he said. ‘Amid the COVID outbreak, the past government allocated incentives for SMEs affected due the situation then. However, only 27 per cent of the incentives were disbursed, and most of them went to small-scale companies owned by big businesses,’ he said. The Bangladesh Bank on April 2020 announced an incentive package of Tk 20,000 crore for the SMEs affected due to the COVID outbreak. According to the 2013 Economic Census conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, there were 8,66,424 SME establishments in the country, and a total of 73,06,797 persons were engaged in the businesses. A recent SME Foundation study said that about 57 per cent of SME entrepreneurs mentioned tax structure as the main obstacle to doing business in compliance with the law while about 54 per cent of the entrepreneurs considered trade licence renewal process as an obstacle. According to the white paper, SMEs were relatively vulnerable to infrastructural weaknesses, such as non-availability and erratic power supply, poor transport networks, and inaccessibility of modern logistics and communication systems. It added that these factors raised operational costs and restrained capacity for expansion. ‘Where large firms may be able to afford the investment in alternatives or receive favourable treatment, SMEs are often bearing the brunt of this, further extending the gulf between them and larger enterprises,’ it further said. The white paper suggested policymakers to take up the particular needs of the SMEs, especially with regard to access to finance, infrastructure and simplification of regulatory procedures, to enable them to become more contributory to economic growth in order to make the business environment more inclusive.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/251829/smes-hamstrung-by-limited-access-to-finance-over-past-decade
KEPZ decides to fast-track land registration,"The governing body of the Korean Export Processing Zone, headed by the chief adviser, decided on Monday to fast-track its land registration and ease its bond licensing procedure to turn the key industrial park into a foreign direct investment hub. Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus convened the governing body meeting for the KEPZ at his office at Tejgaon in the capital. This was the first meeting of the KEPZ Governing Body, which was presided over by the head of the government in nine years. The meeting covered several important issues, including land rights, ports and customs, labour law, and investor support mechanisms. The committee took executive decisions to complete the remaining land handover to KEPZ as quickly as possible, roll out the authorised economic operator model, ease the bond licensing procedure, and open dialogue on labour laws. The committee also unanimously decided to decentralise authority and fast-track service by moving KEPZ out of CAO’s direct administration to BEZA. These steps are expected to send a signal to the wider investment community that Bangladesh is open for business. BIDA and BEZA executive chairman Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun said, ‘We must support our existing investors to make them our ambassadors. As a test case, a separate SWAT team was set up in BIDA to identify key challenges in KEPZ and resolve them.’ ‘We wanted to set an example. And today’s successful meeting demonstrates government can also execute in pace,’ he said. Lutfey Siddiqi, chief adviser’s special envoy for international affairs, said, ‘Today’s result illustrates a new style of government that operates with clear intent and focused execution. We hope that a virtuous cycle of feedback and responsive reforms will make many of the grievances about our investment climate out of date very soon.’ KEPZ, primarily operated by Youngone Corporation, currently employs over 34,000 Bangladeshis in 48 state-of-the-art industrial units.

Thousands strike at VW’s Germany plants,"Thousands of Volkswagen workers went on strike Monday in an escalating industrial dispute, with unions warning that the crisis-hit German auto giant is intent on making mass layoffs and closing factories. Waving signs reading ‘You want war, we are ready!’ and the red flags of the powerful IG Metall Union, employees at plants across the country walked out over management plans to make huge cuts. VW has been hit hard by high manufacturing costs at home, a stuttering shift to electric vehicles and tough competition in key market China. The VW group — which owns 10 brands from Audi and Porsche to Skoda and Seat — said it ‘respects workers’ rights’ and believes in ‘constructive dialogue’ in a bid to reach ‘a lasting solution that is collectively supported’. It also said that it had taken ‘measures to guarantee urgent deliveries’ during the strike action. IG Metall and the works council have fought to protect jobs since VW announced in September that it was weighing the unprecedented step of shutting some plants in Germany, where it has around 1,20,000 employees. ‘Our colleagues are angry. Their jobs have been under threat for three months and they have been waiting for a chance to finally show what they think,’ an IG Metall spokesman at the VW factory in the eastern city of Zwickau told AFP. Thousands of workers marched alongside a line of new electric cars leaving the Zwickau plant as part of the industrial action, with walkouts also observed at plants from Hanover to VW’s historic headquarters of Wolfsburg. To the sound of cheering crowds, blaring horns and banging drums, works council chief Daniela Cavallo told a rally that VW’s bosses were seeking to ‘sell out Germany as an industrial location’ and strip employees of their rights. But she said the ‘Volkswagen family’ was united and had ‘huge stamina’ to fight a drawn-out industrial dispute. IG Metall announced at the weekend that industrial action would get underway Monday with a series of ‘warning strikes’, which are short walks-outs, after the company had last week rejected the union’s proposals for protecting jobs. Union negotiator Thorsten Groeger has warned it will be ‘the toughest wage dispute Volkswagen has ever seen’. He charged that ‘Volkswagen has set fire to our collective bargaining agreements’ and that the company board was now ‘throwing open petrol drums into it’. ‘What follows now is the conflict that Volkswagen brought about — We did not want it, but we will conduct it as committedly as necessary.’ Labour representatives say VW wants to close at least three plants in Germany and axe tens of thousands of jobs, with remaining workers facing 10 per cent pay cuts. The crisis at the German industrial titan comes as the eurozone’s top economy struggles, and amid heightened political uncertainty with elections looming in February. Volkswagen’s perilous financial position was highlighted in October when it reported a 64 per cent plunge in third-quarter profit to 1.58 billion euros ($1.7 billion). Slowing business in China, where homegrown rivals are outselling the German carmaker, has been a particularly heavy blow. VW cited ‘economic reasons’ last week when it announced the sale of its operations in China’s Xinjiang, though the company had also been under pressure to exit the northwestern region due to human rights concerns. Further clouding the outlook is an EU move to impose hefty tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars, which VW fears could trigger retaliatory steps. Its woes reflect a broader crisis in the European auto industry, with demand weak and the transition to electric cars slower than expected. In Germany, VW, BMW and Mercedes-Benz have all downgraded their profit forecasts recently while key suppliers to the industry have been announcing job cuts.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/251827/thousands-strike-at-vws-germany-plants

Lai talks ‘China threats’ with Pelosi,"Taiwan president Lai Ching-te discussed ‘China’s military threats’ toward the island in a call with former US House speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday, drawing a fresh barrage of criticism from Beijing. Pelosi’s long-standing support for Taiwan has infuriated China, which responded to her visit to Taipei in 2022 with massive military drills around the island. Lai and Pelosi discussed ‘China’s military threats toward Taiwan’, presidential spokeswoman Karen Kuo told reporters, describing the 20-minute call between the ‘long-time friends’ as ‘warm and amicable’. China, which insists the island is part of its territory, opposes any international recognition of Taiwan and its claim to be a sovereign state. Beijing especially bristles at official contact between the island and the United States, which is Taiwan’s most important supporter and biggest arms supplier. China has already fumed over more US arms sales to the island and Lai’s stop in Hawaii, where he was welcomed with red carpets, garlands of flowers and ‘alohas’. In response to Lai’s conversation with Pelosi, China called on the United States to ‘stop meddling with Taiwan’ and cease ‘supporting and indulging Taiwan independence separatist forces’. ‘The Taiwan issue is the core of China’s core interests and the first red line that cannot be crossed in China-US relations,’ foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian told reporters in Beijing. Since arriving in Hawaii on Saturday at the start of a Pacific tour, Lai has met with state Governor Josh Green, members of the US Congress, officials from the de facto US embassy in Taiwan and others. In his first public speech of the trip, Lai said Saturday that we have to ‘fight together to prevent war,’ warning there were ‘no winners’ from conflict. On the eve of Lai’s week-long Pacific tour, the United States approved a proposed sale to Taiwan of spare parts for F-16s and radar systems, as well as communications equipment, in deals valued at $385 million in total. China’s foreign ministry called on the United States over the weekend to ‘immediately stop arming Taiwan’. ‘China will take strong and resolute countermeasures to firmly defend national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,’ it added. In a separate statement, the foreign ministry said China ‘strongly condemns’ the United States for Lai’s stopover and that it had ‘lodged serious protests with the US’. Pelosi was one of ‘several long-time friends in the United States’ whom Lai spoke to on Sunday, Kuo told reporters. They included ‘cross-party figures who reiterated their steadfast support for Taiwan’, she said. Lai and Pelosi also discussed artificial intelligence and the semiconductor industry, Kuo said. The Taiwanese leader addressed the East-West Centre in a closed-door forum on Sunday, emphasizing Taiwan’s ‘commitment’ to boosting its defences and to ‘its own security’, as well as the ‘shared commitment between Taiwan and the US to regional peace’, according to Kuo. Taiwan faces the constant threat of a military attack by China, which regularly deploys fighter jets and warships around the self-ruled island to press its claims, and Beijing has not ruled out the use of force to bring the island under its control. While the United States has sold billions of dollars worth of arms to Taiwan, Washington has long maintained a ‘strategic ambiguity’ when it comes to putting boots on the ground to defend the island from Beijing. Lai’s remarks followed China’s threats last week to ‘resolutely crush’ any attempts for Taiwan independence and ahead of US president-elect Donald Trump taking office in January. Trump caused jitters during his campaign by suggesting Taiwan should pay the United States for its defence and accusing the island of stealing the US semiconductor industry. After Hawaii, Lai will visit Taiwan’s allies the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau — the only Pacific island nations among the 12 remaining allies that recognise Taiwan’s claim to statehood — and stop over for one night in the US territory of Guam. Lai said shortly before take-off in Taipei that the trip ‘ushered in a new era of values-based democracy’ and thanked the US government for ‘helping to make this trip a smooth one’. He said he wanted to ‘continue to expand cooperation and deepen partnerships with our allies based on the values of democracy, peace and prosperity.’ ‘I once again emphasise that we are all Team Taiwan. We all work together, and we can successfully achieve our goals,’ Lai told reporters on board the plane.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/251825/lai-talks-china-threats-with-pelosi

Biden pardons son Hunter ahead of sentencing,"US president Joe Biden on Sunday issued an official pardon for his son Hunter, who is facing sentencing for two criminal cases related to tax evasion and the purchase of a firearm. ‘No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son — and that is wrong,’ the president said in a statement, calling it ‘a miscarriage of justice.’ The younger Biden was convicted earlier this year of lying about his drug use when he bought a gun — a felony — and has also pleaded guilty in a separate tax evasion trial. The pardon comes after Biden has repeatedly said he wouldn’t intervene in his son’s legal troubles. The White House press secretary said as recently as September that Biden wouldn’t issue a pardon for Hunter. At the same time, criminal cases against president-elect Donald Trump have come to a standstill after a sweeping ruling on presidential immunity by the Supreme Court — all but ensuring Biden’s Republican rival will likely never see a jail cell, even after his landmark conviction for falsifying business records in May. ‘I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department’s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,’ Biden said in Sunday’s statement. ‘The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election,’ he added. ‘I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/north-america/251823/biden-pardons-son-hunter-ahead-of-sentencing
"Nepal PM departs for China visit, breaking with India tradition","Nepal’s prime minister left Monday for his first bilateral visit to China, a departure from the usual practice by the Himalayan republic’s leaders of making India their first official destination. Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli, who returned to power in July after two earlier stints as premier, will meet Chinese president Xi Jinping and hold talks with Premier Li Qiang on the four-day trip. ‘The prime minister will land this evening,’ Nepal foreign ministry spokesman Suvanga Parajuli said. Oli has in the past trod a fine balance between Nepal’s two powerful neighbours but favoured Beijing in a bid to decrease his country’s historical dependence on New Delhi. ‘The two countries’ leaders will have in-depth exchanges of views on deepening our traditional friendship, expanding Belt and Road cooperation and exchanges and cooperation in various fields, as well as international and regional issues of mutual interest,’ China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said last week during a press conference. Pradeep Gyawali, the deputy secretary of Oli’s Communist Party of Nepal Unified Marxist-Leninist, said that discussions would centre on prior investment deals. That includes for the recently finished construction of an international airport in the tourist hub of Pokhara, with talk that the Chinese loan underwriting the project could be converted into a grant. Nepali media reported that Oli likely chose Beijing as his first destination due to the absence of a formal invitation from New Delhi. Nepal is bordered entirely by India and China and both countries hold sway in the Himalayan republic, though India holds a larger share of trade and influence. India accounted for nearly 65 per cent of Nepal’s total trade in the 2023-24 fiscal year, according to customs data. China’s trade share was about 15 per cent by contrast, though Chinese companies lead in some industries including a 70 per cent share of Nepal’s electric vehicle market. India has the highest foreign investment in Nepal, pumping in more than $750 million last year, with China investing more than $250 million, according to Nepal’s central bank.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/251822/nepal-pm-departs-for-china-visit-breaking-with-india-tradition
"UN chief says situation in Gaza ‘appalling, apocalyptic’","The United Nations chief said Monday the situation in war-torn Gaza was ‘appalling and apocalyptic’, warning conditions faced by Palestinians in the territory may amount to the ‘gravest international crimes’. In remarks read out on his behalf at a Cairo conference aimed at increasing humanitarian aid, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres urged the international community to ‘build a foundation for sustainable peace in Gaza and across the Middle East’. The war in Gaza broke out when Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, resulting in 1,208 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Israel’s retaliatory campaign has killed 44,429 people in Gaza, according to figures from the territory’s health ministry that the UN considers reliable. Guterres highlighted the devastating toll of the conflict and the urgent need for international action. ‘Malnutrition is rampant famine is imminent. Meanwhile, the health system has collapsed,’ he said. The UN chief added that Gaza now has ‘the highest number of children amputees per capita anywhere in the world’, with ‘many losing limbs and undergoing surgeries without even anesthesia’. The secretary-general also criticised the severe restrictions on aid delivery, calling the current levels ‘grossly insufficient’. According to UNRWA’s count, only 65 aid trucks per day had been able to enter Gaza this past month, compared to a pre-war average of 500. International aid organisations have repeatedly raised alarm over the deteriorating conditions in Gaza, warning that civilians are on the brink of famine. They have said aid shipments reaching the enclave are now at their lowest since the start of the war. Israel, which early in the conflict imposed a complete siege for a period on the Hamas-ruled territory, has blamed aid issues on what it says is the inability of relief organisations to handle and distribute large quantities of aid. UN’s Guterres said on Monday that the blockade of aid to Gaza ‘is not a crisis of logistics’ but rather ‘a crisis of political will and of respect for fundamental principles of international humanitarian law’. UNRWA said all the attempts it made to deliver aid into northern Gaza had either been ‘denied’ or ‘impeded’ between October 6, 2024 and November 25, amid fierce fighting in the area. Guterres said UNRWA is an ‘irreplaceable lifeline for millions of Palestinians’, adding that ‘if UNRWA is forced to close, the responsibility of replacing its vital services would rest with Israel’.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/251821/un-chief-says-situation-in-gaza-appalling-apocalyptic
"Syria, Russia conduct strikes to push back rebel advance","The Syrian military and its ally Russia conducted deadly joint air raids on areas under Islamist-led rebel control on Monday, as they battle a lightning offensive that has wrested swathes of Syria from government control. Syria’s president Bashar al-Assad is backed by Russia and Iran, both of which have confirmed they will help his army fight back after Aleppo, the country’s second city, fell out of government control. Syria has been at war since Assad cracked down on democracy protests in 2011, and the conflict has since drawn in foreign powers and jihadists, and left 5,00,000 people dead. With Assad’s army back in control of much of the country after years of shifting battle lines, the conflict had been mostly dormant until last week, when an Islamist-led rebel alliance launched an offensive. During the weekend, Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group and allied factions took over Aleppo city, barring neighbourhoods controlled by Kurdish forces, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. For the first time since the civil war started more than a decade ago, the country’s second city ‘is out of control of Syrian regime forces’, Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said on Sunday. Aleppo, an ancient city dominated by its landmark citadel, is home to two million people, and was the scene of fierce battles earlier in the conflict. But until this weekend, the rebels were never able to totally take over. AFPTV footage showed rebels in military fatigues patrolling the streets of Aleppo, with some setting fire to a Syrian flag and others holding up the green, red, black and white flag of the revolution. While the streets appeared to be mostly empty, some were out to cheer for the advancing fighters. HTS is an alliance led by al-Qaeda’s former Syria branch. It is fighting alongside allied factions, with units taking orders from a joint command. On Monday, air raids conducted jointly by the Syrian and Russian air forces on several areas of Idlib province in northwest Syria killed 11 civilians, including five children, according to the Observatory. ‘The strikes targeted displaced families living on the edge of a displacement camp,’ said Hussein Ahmed Khudur, a 45-year-old teacher who sought refuge at the camp from fighting in Aleppo province. He said one of the children who died was a student of his, and that the other four were his four sisters. Russia, which first intervened directly in the Syrian war in 2015, said Monday it continued to support Assad. ‘We of course continue to support Bashar al-Assad and we continue contacts at the appropriate levels, we are analysing the situation,’ Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. Iran’s top diplomat Abbas Araghchi, was in Syria on Sunday to deliver a message of support, state media said. On Monday, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei said the Islamic republic had entered Syria at the official invitation of Assad’s government. ‘Our military advisers were present in Syria, and they are still present. The presence of advisers from the Islamic Republic of Iran in Syria is not a new thing,’ he said. While the fighting is rooted in a war that began more than a decade ago, much has changed since then. Millions of Syrians have become displaced, with around 5.5 million living in neighbouring countries. Most of those involved in the initial anti-Assad protests are either dead, living in exile or in jail. Russia is at war in Ukraine, and Iran’s militant allies Hezbollah and Hamas have been massively weakened by more than a year of conflict with Israel. On Monday, Iran’s foreign ministry said it would maintain its military support for the Syrian government. But the role of Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which played a key role in backing the government particularly around Aleppo, remains in question particularly after it withdrew from several of its positions to focus on fighting Israel. HTS and its allies began their offensive on Wednesday, just as a ceasefire took effect in Lebanon after more than a year of war between Hezbollah and Israel. The violence in Syria has killed more than 457 people, mostly combatants but also including at least 72 civilians, according to the Observatory, which has a network of sources inside Syria. The Observatory said rebel advances met little resistance. Aaron Stein, president of the US-based Foreign Policy Research Institute, said ‘Russia’s presence has thinned out considerably and quick reaction air strikes have limited utility’. He called the rebel advance ‘a reminder of how weak the regime is’. Air strikes on Sunday on parts of Aleppo were the first since 2016. One resident said most locals were ‘holed up at home’. Aron Lund of the Century International think tank said: ‘Aleppo seems to be lost for the regime.’ He added: ‘And a government without Aleppo is not really a functional government of Syria.’ Rebels have also taken dozens of towns across the north, including Khan Sheikhun and Maaret al-Numan, roughly halfway between Aleppo and Hama, the Observatory said. AFPTV footage showed rebels pushing into Hama province in central Syria, as well as army tanks and equipment abandoned on the roadside. The United States and its allies France, Germany and Britain called Sunday for ‘de-escalation’ in Syria, and for the protection of civilians and infrastructure. The United States maintains hundreds of troops in northeast Syria as part of an anti-jihadist coalition. Parallel to the HTS-led offensive, pro-Turkey factions in northern Syria attacked Kurdish fighters in Aleppo province on Sunday, with the Observatory saying they seized the strategic town of Tal Rifaat and nearby villages. On Monday, in light of the takeover of Tal Rifaat, a US-backed, Kurdish-led force in Syria said it is seeking to evacuate Kurds around Aleppo to safe areas under its control.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/251820/syria-russia-conduct-strikes-to-push-back-rebel-advance
Trade halted at Zakiganj customs station as Indian protesters turn back trucks,"All trade activities, including imports and exports, through the Zakiganj Customs Station in Sylhet have been suspended following protests by Indian demonstrators. The shutdown occurred on Monday due to agitation by the Sanatani Oikya Mancha, a group in Sreebhumi (Karimganj) of Assam, India. Jahangir Hossain, revenue officer at Zakiganj Customs Station, confirmed the halt in trade and said, ‘Protesters in Sreebhumi turned back trucks carrying goods imported under Bangladeshi LCs.’ He noted that while no goods have been exported from Bangladesh to India via Zakiganj for a long time, certain items, including fruits, are imported. Meanwhile, goods from Bangladeshi companies such as Pran and Akij are regularly exported to India through Sheola (Sutarkandi) Land Port. Earlier in the day, around six tons of oranges were imported into Bangladesh from Sreebhumi via Zakiganj Customs Station. Efforts by Bangladeshi customs officials to contact their counterparts at Sreebhumi Customs Station regarding the suspension were unsuccessful, as Indian officials did not respond to calls, according to a customs official in Zakiganj. Sources on the Indian side revealed that earlier Monday, members of the Sanatani Oikya Mancha burned Bangladeshi products, including potatoes and cakes exported through the Sheola Land Port.

Liverpool flip script on City to take commanding Premier League lead,"Liverpool have been used to second best during Pep Guardiola's era at Manchester City, but a 2-0 victory over the crisis-hit champions left little doubt over who are the team to beat in this season's Premier League title race. Goals in either half from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah at Anfield on Sunday did not do justice to the scale of the Reds' domination as City succumbed to a sixth defeat in a seven-game winless run. Arsenal and Chelsea are now Liverpool's closest challengers, nine points behind, with City 11 back and almost certain to finally loose their grip on the English top flight after an unprecedented four consecutive titles and six in the past seven seasons. Guardiola reminded the Anfield crowd of that fact by raising six fingers when taunted with chants of ‘sacked in the morning’. The Catalan's defiance, though, could not mask the fact that City have rested on their laurels, while Liverpool have stepped up a level under Arne Slot. Slot appeared to have the impossible job of succeeding the much-loved Jurgen Klopp. The charismatic German brought Liverpool back to the top of English and European football. His title triumph in 2019/2020 was the club's first for 30 years and the only blot on City's dominance in recent times. In contrast to Alex Ferguson's departure from Manchester United and Arsene Wenger's exit at Arsenal, Liverpool have turned a legendary figure leaving into a positive. Klopp did much of the groundwork himself, rejuvenating the squad over his final 18 months in charge with the signings of Gakpo, Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and Ryan Gravenberch. Slot's only summer signing, Federico Chiesa, has barely featured due to injury. But the injection of fresh blood, mixed with the experience of title winners in the prolific Salah, captain Virgil van Dijk, Andy Roberson and Trent Alexander-Arnold has proved a winning combination. Slot has been keen to give Klopp's legacy credit, but the Dutchman deserves his due for the small details that have produced a run of 18 wins from his first 20 games in all competitions. Robertson and Alexander-Arnold's narrower positions have left Liverpool less vulnerable in transition and contributed to them having the best defensive record in the league. Gravenberch has shone since being transformed into a holding midfielder, while Gakpo is finally delivering on his potential under his compatriot. Slot has also managed to keep Liverpool's momentum rolling despite constant speculation over the futures of Salah, Van Dijk and Alexander-Arnold, all of whom are out of contract at the end of the season. ‘City are a fantastic team, four times champions in a row and they have quality to punish any team,’ said Van Dijk. ‘So, overall, it has been a great day. ‘It's game-by-game and stay calm. But games like this, when you win it like this, is always a good feeling.’ It is not just the Premier League that Slot has so far bent to his will. Liverpool are also top of the Champions League with a perfect record from five games, including a memorable 2-0 win over Real Madrid on Wednesday. Victory over City capped a dream week, but the former Feyenoord boss was still keen to use the English and European champions as the benchmark for his side's aspirations. ‘Real Madrid and Manchester City have been and are so good, with managers that have won so many trophies, so it is always nice to come out of those situations as a winner,’ added Slot. ‘But they were able to win every single three days. We understand what we want to achieve is more than this winning once or twice, even against these big teams, if you want to win big things.’ December may only be a day old, but already it is hard to see beyond Liverpool matching Manchester United's record tally for 20 English top-flight titles come May.

"Bangladesh condemns attack on mission in Agartala, says police did not prevent vandalism","Dhaka has deeply resented the violent demonstration and attack by a large group of protesters of the Hindu Sangharsh Samity on Monday afternoon on the premises of the Assistant High Commission of Bangladesh in Agartala of India. ‘This particular act in Agartala stands in violation of the inviolability of diplomatic missions, as the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961, asks for,’ said the Bangladesh foreign ministry in a press statement. It said that all members of the Assistant High Commission were left ‘with a deep sense of insecurity.’ ‘As it is the responsibility of the host government to protect the diplomatic missions from any form of intrusion or damage, the Government of Bangladesh calls upon the Government of India to take immediate action to address this incident, to undertake a thorough investigation into the incident and to prevent any further acts of violence against the diplomatic missions of Bangladesh in India, including the safety and security of the diplomats and the non-diplomatic members of staff and members of their families,’ the statement said. It said that the accounts received conclusively attest that the protesters were allowed to aggress into the premises, by breaking down the main gate of Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in a pre-planned manner. ‘In the process, in the presence of the members of the local law enforcement agencies, they vandalised the flag pole, desecrated the national flag of Bangladesh and also damaged properties inside the Assistant High Commission,’ the foreign ministry said, adding that regrettably, the local police members present in charge of protecting the premises were found not to be active in containing the situation from the beginning. The Bangladesh government would further like to underline that this heinous attack on its diplomatic mission and desecration of the national flag came in a pattern, further to a similar violent demonstration in Kolkata on November 28, 2024, the release said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/251814/bangladesh-condemns-attack-on-mission-in-agartala-says-police-did-not-prevent-vandalism
"BNP, others condemn attack on Bangladesh mission, Mamata’s remarks","The Bangladesh Nationalist Party, several other political parties and student bodies on Monday condemned the attack on the Bangladesh mission in Agartala of India and West Bengal’s chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s remarks. Urging Mamata to immediately withdraw her statement where she called for sending United Nations peacekeeping mission to Bangladesh, the BNP in a statement later in the evening said that Mamata Banerjee’s remark was a threat to  the Bangladesh’s independence and sovereignty. ‘In some newspapers this morning, we saw the statement of the chief minister of the Indian state of West Bengal about Bangladesh. The statement she [Mamata] made about sending peacekeepers to Bangladesh… is a threat to the independence and sovereignty of Bangladesh and we think that the statement reflects to some extent the views of the leadership,’ BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said on behalf of the party. ‘I think that West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee should immediately withdraw this statement. She should not even entertain such thoughts. Because the people of Bangladesh gained independence through the War of Independence, and recently through a revolution they regained democracy…The people of this country will stand against such a conspiracy at any cost,’ he said. While addressing the West Bengal Assembly on Monday, Mamata called for the deployment of UN peacekeepers and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s personal intervention to secure the safety of religious minorities in Bangladesh. Fakhrul said that the false stories were being circulated and published in the Indian media outlets about the deterioration of communal harmony in Bangladesh were in no way acceptable. ‘The very unfortunate things that are being said about Bangladesh, and the new conspiracy that has recently started in Bangladesh regarding ISKCON [International Society for Krishna Consciousness in Bangladesh] will never be accepted by the people of Bangladesh,’ he said. A group of protestors demonstrating near the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission broke through the police cordon and barged into the office premises in Agartala of India. India has, meanwhile, expressed regrets over the breach of the Bangladesh mission premises in Tripura’s Agartala, reports The Week. Students of Dhaka University, Jahangirnagar University and others brought out processions on their campuses and other places protesting at the Mamata’s remarks and attack on Bangladeshi mission in Agartala. A group of students, on the other hand, under the banner of the Student Movement Against Discrimination brought out a procession on the Dhaka University campus while Gono Odhikar Parishad brought out a separate procession in Bijoynagar area in the capital protesting at the attack on Bangladesh mission in Agartala. A group of Jahangirnagar University students brought out a torch procession on the campus on Monday evening, protesting at the attack on Bangladesh mission, New Age correspondent at the University reported. Under the banner of Movement to Protect the Mass Uprising, students staged the protest programme on the campus. The march, which began in the Battala area at about 9:00pm, drew more than a hundred participants who carried torches and raised slogans against the attack and assault on Bangladeshi flag. Besides, in a statement, Revolutionary Workers Party general secretary Saiful Huq condemned the attack in Agartala and the activities of Hindutvadi extremists on the Benapole border are extremely provocative.

Mbappe takes PSG wage dispute to French league committee,"France star Kylian Mbappe has referred his former club Paris Saint-Germain to the disciplinary committee of the French league in a row over unpaid wages and bonuses, a source close to the body told AFP on Monday. The league source said a hearing will take place on December 11 over PSG's refusal to pay 55 million euros ($57.9m) owed to the striker, who moved to Real Madrid in June. PSG were ordered by the LFP to pay Mbappe the sum owed from his time at the Parc des Princes but said in October they would refuse to do so on the basis that the player had agreed in August 2023 to waive the money. Last month the French Football Federation rejected Qatar-owned PSG's request to reconsider the order to pay Mbappe, saying it was submitted a day late. According to the French league's statutes, PSG could face a fine or a ban on signing players. However, it is understood that PSG are confident that the LFP cannot have the final say on the case and that it would have to go before an industrial tribunal. The origins of the conflict go back to an agreement between the parties in August of last year. At that point, the France captain had been sidelined from the PSG squad for refusing to extend a contract that was due to expire in June of this year. Such an extension would have at least allowed PSG to pocket a transfer fee if Mbappe left, but in the end he joined Real under freedom of contract. According to that agreement, Mbappe was prepared to waive 55 million euros in different bonuses if he left for free at the end of the 2023/24 season. However, the validity of the agreement -- which the player himself alluded to before the media in January -- is contested by Mbappe's entourage.

Final voter list to be published on Mar 2: EC,"The election commission on Monday said that it would make the country’s final voter list public on March 2. ‘The final voter list of 2025 will be published on March 02,’ said election commissioner brigadier general, retd, Abul Fazal Md Sanaullah while talking to reporters after the first meeting of the newly formed Election Commission on Monday. Chief election commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin presided over the meeting held at Nirbachan Bhaban in Agargaon, Dhaka. Sanaullah said the data of 1.7 million eligible people had so far been collected, who will be registered as new voters on January 1, 2025. Of them, the data of some 1.3 million proposed voters was collected in 2022 and the remaining 400,000 people came to the election offices on different occasions to be voters, he said. The commissioner said the EC would go for the door-to-door data collection to update the country’s voter lists after the celebration of the national voter day on March 2 next. During the door-to-door campaign, the data of the already dropout voters and others who would be eligible to be voters in 2026 will be collected, he said. Then these proposed voters -- whose data would be collected during the programme -- will be incorporated as new voters in the 2026 electoral rolls, he added. The commissioner said it will take some six months to complete the door-to-door data collection campaign. He said EC additional secretary KM Ali Newaz said the draft of the updated voter list was published on January 2 every year. Then the EC receives complaints over the draft list and finalises the electoral rolls disposing of the complaints. Three other election commissioners -- Md Anwarul Islam Sarker, Abdur Rahmanel Masud and Begum Tahmida Ahmad - were present at the meeting.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251810/final-voter-list-to-be-published-on-mar-2-ec

Elton John unable to watch own musical as he ‘lost eyesight’,"Elton John has revealed he was unable to watch his new musical ‘The Devil Wears Prada’ as his eyesight has been severely affected by an eye infection. ‘I haven’t been able to come to many of the previews because, as you know, I have lost my eyesight,’ the 77-year-old singer told the audience late Sunday at a London charity gala performance of the musical, for which he wrote the score. ‘So it’s hard for me to see it, but I love to hear it and, boy, it sounded good tonight,’ he said. The ‘Rocket Man’ star posted on Instagram in September that an infection had ‘left me with only limited vision in one eye’. ‘I am healing, but it’s an extremely slow process and it will take some time before sight returns to the impacted eye,’ he added. He told ABC News in the US last month that the infection had left him without sight in his right eye and that ‘my left eye is not the greatest’. John wound down a glittering live career with a global farewell tour in 2022 and 2023, playing his final show in his native UK at the Glastonbury Festival and his last-ever gig in Sweden. US singer Vanessa Williams plays feared fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly in the stage adaptation of the 2006 film. ‘I said I wanted to be a part of it because I could create the role and that means that you’re informing the script, the music, the choreography, all the action,’ she told the media on Thursday.

Stampede kills at least 56 at Guinea football match,"A deadly stampede at a football match killed at least 56 people in Guinea's second city N'Zerekore, the junta-controlled government said Monday. The events at Sunday's match, which were initially reported as clashes between fans, were triggered after a player was sent off at the end of the game, witnesses said. The match in the southeastern city was the final of a tournament organised in honour of Guinea's junta leader, Mamady Doumbouya, who seized power in a 2021 coup and has installed himself as president. The opposition has accused the junta of using sport for political ends. Witnesses said fans invaded the pitch following the referee's decision, with some attacking the stand designated for officials, prompting the intervention of security forces. ‘Protests of dissatisfaction with refereeing decisions led to stone-throwing by supporters, resulting in fatal stampedes,’ said a government statement which was read out on national television. ‘Hospital services have put the provisional death toll at 56, with several others injured,’ it added, describing the incident as a ‘tragic event’. ‘The government assures the public that investigations will be carried out to establish who is responsible for this unfortunate event’, the statement said. Young people also set fire to a police station overnight, according to public television. Prime Minister Amadou Oury Bah condemned the ‘incidents that marred the match between the teams of Labe and N'Zerekore’, in a post on Facebook. ‘The government is following the situation and reiterates its call for calm so as not to impede hospital services from aiding the injured,’ he added. Doctors told AFP on Sunday that dozens had died. Videos circulating on social media, which AFP was unable to immediately verify, showed scenes of chaos in the street outside the match and numerous bodies lying on the ground. Local media reported that hospital wards and a morgue were overwhelmed by the injured and dead. Such tournaments and other public gatherings have become common in the West African nation, in what is widely seen as a campaign to promote Doumbouya's candidacy in any future presidential election. The military seized power by force in September 2021 by overthrowing civilian President Alpha Conde. Under international pressure, the junta pledged to hand power back to a civilian government by the end of 2024 but has since made clear it will not. Several of Doumbouya's aides have recently expressed their support for his possible presidential bid. One of the last remaining dissident voices in Guinea, the National Front for the Defence of the Constitution, published a statement expressing its ‘indignation’ at the tragedy in N'Zerekore. It said it held the junta chief and his government ‘directly responsible for this disaster, which cost the lives of innocent citizens, including many children’. ‘This demonstrates the cynical use of sport by the junta, exploiting these images of mobilisation for political ends,’ the statement added. The pro-democracy movement called on Guineans ‘to mobilise calmly and resolutely to demand an end to this regime from December 31, 2024’.

Dhaka for relation with Delhi based on mutual interests,"Foreign adviser Md Touhid Hossain on Monday said that the interim government wanted a ‘normal and good relation’ with New Delhi while maintaining mutual interests of both nations. He said that Dhaka’s relation with New Delhi before the August 5 situation was not the same since the fall of Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India amid the student-led mass uprising bringing an end to her over 15-year autocratic regime. ‘We want a normal and good relation with India maintaining mutual interests of the two countries. The county’s interest lies in the core of our relation,’ said Touhid, also a former diplomat, responding to a question over Bangladesh’s relation with India after the changeover with professor Muhammad Yunus leading the interim government since August 8. The adviser was talking to reporters after briefing the diplomats stationed in Dhaka at state guesthouse Padma and explaining the government’s position on minority issues and  describing the present situation on the ground. Around 60 diplomats from almost all missions and countries, including United States, United Kingdom and European Union, joined the diplomatic briefing. The Indian High Commission, however, sent its representative holding the rank of counsellor in place of the High Commissioner. The foreign adviser said that they shared with the diplomats under what circumstances former ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) leader Chinmoy Krishna Das, now in jail, was arrested. He said that the message he tried to convey to the foreign envoys was that religious harmony was an integrated part of Bangladesh’s society and it was again proved recently. ‘The government is determined to maintaining that harmony. We would contain with strong hand if anyone tries to incite sectarian violence,’ he added. The adviser said that some organisations were engaged in spreading propaganda against Bangladesh to destabilise the situation here. Touhid said that a section of the media, especially in India, was engaged in propaganda. ‘We have told them that we as a society have always been maintaining communal harmony. We are not saying that there are no such incidents of attacks on minorities, but those are stray incidents that happened more or less during all regimes in the past. Actions are taken always if such incident happens,’ he said. Responding to a question, Touhid Hossain said that they did not say anything specific about India but the role of some media outlets in India came up following the arrest of the Hindu community leader as there were elements of provocations for sectarian violence. He said that the government would not allow any sectarian violence since it did not discriminate any citizen on their religious beliefs. About the coming Foreign Office Consultations scheduled to be held in Dhaka this month, he said that he thought it would be held as per schedule.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/251804/dhaka-for-relation-with-delhi-based-on-mutual-interests
Yunus urges Sweden to invest more in Bangladesh,"Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on Monday invited more Swedish investment, saying that the interim government was carrying out vital reforms to ensure ease in doing business in Bangladesh. ‘We encourage more Swedish investment in Bangladesh,’ Yunus said when the ambassador of Sweden, Nicolas Weeks, called on the Chief Adviser at his Tejgaon office in Dhaka. He said that his government had curbed corruption, made investment in export processing zones easier, and moved to ratify International Labour Organization conventions on labour laws. Ambassador Weeks said that his government supported the Yunus-led interim government and its move to reform the police, judiciary, election commission and civil administration, according to a press statement issued by the press wing of the Chief Adviser’s Office. ‘Let me assure you that you have our full support in this transition,’ the statement quoted Weeks as saying. During the meeting, they also discussed aspects of the July-August movement, the government’s reform initiatives, Swedish investment in Bangladesh, and women’s role in the mass uprising. Yunus said that his government was determined to carry out reforms before holding elections. He said that the ‘key word of the revolution’ was reform. The CA said that the situation in the country had become stable, although there remained some challenges including managing high expectations from various groups in the society. ‘Managing expectations is a big task. We are trying, but we are very careful,’ he said. Lamiya Morshed, senior secretary and principal coordinator of SDG Affairs, and Shahnaz Gazi, director general of the foreign ministry, were also present during the meeting.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/251803/yunus-urges-sweden-to-invest-more-in-bangladesh
"Mehidy to lead, no Shanto, Towhid in WI ODIs","All-rounder Mehidy Hasan Miraz will lead Bangladesh in the forthcoming three-match ODI series against the West Indies, as the Bangladesh Cricket Board announced a 15-member squad for the series on Monday. This will be the first time that Mehidy will be leading the Tigers in a full ODI series after regular captain Najmul Hossain Shanto was left out from the squad as he was still recovering from a groin injury. Ace all-rounder Shakib al Hasan was left out from the squad. Shakib was advised not to return to the country after the cricketer wanted to play his farewell Test at home against South Africa; he also missed the Afghanistan ODI series in the UAE in November. Along with Shanto and Mushfiqur Rahim, batter Tawhid Hridoy also missed out as he was also declared unfit by the BCB’s medical team due to a groin injury. ‘Hridoy had complained of pain in his right groin region, and subsequent investigations have confirmed the presence of a medical condition,’ said BCB’s sports physician Monzur Hossain Chowdhury, who was quoted as saying in a press release provided by the BCB. ‘He has been advised to rest, and we will reassess him in two weeks to determine his readiness to play.’ Left-handed batter Parvez Hossain, who has already played six T20Is, is the only uncapped member in the squad for the series that starts in St Kitts on December 8. Parvez was previously called up in the ODI squad three years ago but didn’t play any match. Pacer Mustafizur Rahman, who is on leave due to family reasons, will sit out the series. Left-handed batter Zakir Hasan was dropped from the squad that played against Afghanistan in the UAE last month. Meanwhile, another left-hander, Afif Hossain, received a call-up to the squad after a gap of one year. His previous one-day international for Bangladesh was in December 2023. Liton Das and Tanzim Hasan returned to the squad after missing the Afghanistan series due to fever and injury. Pacer Hasan Mahmud also recalled. After impressing on his ODI debut against Afghanistan, fast bowler Nahid Rana kept his place. All three matches will be played at the Warner Park in Basseterre, St Kitts with the second and third ODIs being scheduled on December 10 and 12, respectively. Squad: Mehidy Hasan Miraz (Captain), Liton Das (WK), Tanzid Hasan Tamim, Soumya Sarkar, Parvez Hossain Emon, Mahmudullah, Jaker Ali Anik, Afif Hossain, Rishad Hossain, Nasum Ahmed, Taskin Ahmed, Hasan Mahmud, Shoriful Islam, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Nahid Rana.

"Mamata for UN peacekeeping mission in Bangladesh, BSF foils ‘Bangladesh Chalo’ march","The chief minister of West Bengal in India, Mamata Banerjee, on Monday called for the deployment of United Nations peacekeeping force and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s personal intervention to secure the safety of religious minorities in Bangladesh, reports ndtv.com. Her demands come amid reports that at least three Hindu priests - from the International Society for Krishna Consciousness – have been arrested in Bangladesh, added the report. ‘We have families... properties... and loved ones in Bangladesh. We accept whatever stance the Government of India takes on this...but we condemn atrocities on religious grounds anywhere in the world and appeal to the union government, and the Prime Minister, to intervene,’ she said while addressing the West Bengal Assembly, said the report available online. According to the report, Banerjee at the assembly that she had spoken to the chief of the ISKCON’s Kolkata unit to extend her sympathies and support, and stressed, ‘If Indians are attacked in Bangladesh, then we cannot tolerate it. We can bring back our people... Government of India can take this matter up with the United Nations... so a peacekeeping force can be sent.’ She also said she was not seeking to interfere with the internal affairs of another country, but pointed out that when Bangladeshi fishermen had mistakenly entered Indian waters, or when a Bangladeshi trawler had capsised, her government had ‘rescued them and treated them (well)’, the report added. Besides, the ‘Bangladesh Chalo’ march organised by Sanatani Aikya Manch, a conglomeration of Hindu organisations in the Barak Valley of Assam, in Sribhumi district of Assam demanding the safety of religious minorities in Bangladesh on Sunday was foiled by a three-tier security arrangement near the international border, preventing entry into Bangladesh, reports timesofindia.indiatimes.com.

Reckless batting show keeps Bangladesh at bay,"West Indies put them in favourable position to take full control of the second and final Test by capitalising on Bangladesh's perpetual reckless batting show at Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica on Sunday. After bowling out Bangladesh for just 165 runs, West Indies, led by its captain Kraigg Brathwaite, survived a tricky session to reach 70-1 at stumps on Day 2. The hosts are now trailing by 95 runs but looked all set to take a first innings lead as Brathwaite is still in the crease with 33 from 113 deliveries with Keacy Carty on 19. For Brathwaite it was his 86th Test in a row, that surpassed the mark of 85 by fellow Barbadian Sir Garfield Sobers as the most consecutive Tests played for the West Indies. And he made the occasion more memorable by playing a dogged knock in a session when Bangladesh fast bowler got all kinds of help a pitch could offer. Thanks to his stubbornness, West Indies were able to put them on top. Bangladesh got only success through fast bowler Nahid Rana who clocked 150 kph at regular basis in a helpful pitch to leave the Caribbeans in tatters. He dismissed opener Mikyle Louis for 12, with an outside edge after bowling a delivery that was 148 kph. But Brathwaite negotiated Rana astutely to see off the last hour without any fuss. Earlier, Bangladesh failed to keep their promise to rectify the batting errors. They kept doing the same mistakes in similar fashion. And the first innings of the second Test was no exception. Opener Shadman Islam was the top-scorer with 64 while stan-in captain Mehidy Hasan Miraz made 36. Fast bowler Jayden Seals had taken four wickets, conceding just five runs after bowling 15.5 overs. His economy rate 0.31 is the best in the history amongst the bowlers who bowled at least 90 deliveries in Test cricket. Resuming the day at 69-2, Bangladesh lost four wickets in quick succession before stand-in captain Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Taijul Islam hung around for more than one hour to deny the West Indian attack causing more mayhem. The Day 1 was cut short by soggy outfield, allowing only 25 overs to play. Shadman Islam who survived twice due to a butter-fingered West Indies fielder on truncated Day 1, struggled to counter the swing the Caribbean fast bowler produced in helpful condition. But he somehow managed to stay in the crease. West Indies found success through Shamar Joseph in the 14th over of the day when he rattled the stump of Shahadat Hossain Dipu for 22. Another fast bowler Jayden Seals induced an outside edge of Liton Das to remove him for just 1 in the immediate next over before Joseph dismissed Jaker Ali Anik, also for 1, after the batter got an outside edge, trying for a pull shot. Joseph found his third success in his next over by ending Shadman's painful vigil in the crease as he edged a delivery behind after failing to deal with the late swing. Shadman played 137 balls for his 64, a knock laced with five fours and one six. After losing four wickets for 15 runs in just seven overs, Bangladesh raised the prospect of being all out in just one session. But Miraz and Taijul resisted with the combination of luck and pluck to help Bangladesh add 41 runs for the seventh wicket. Alzarri Joseph broke the partnership after the lunch session, taking out Taijul for 16. Seals then came up with fire to claim the rest of the three wickets, denying Bangladesh to go past 200-run mark. Shamar Joseph ended with 3-49 while senior fast bowler Kemar Roach who claimed two wickets on Day 1, couldn't add any to his tally. Bangladesh lost the first Test by 201 runs.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251800/reckless-batting-show-keeps-bangladesh-at-bay
Bangladesh interim govt chief Yunus for revitalising SAARC,"Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on Monday urged the SAARC Secretariat to work more intensely to make the regional body functional for the common benefit of the South Asian countries. ‘SAARC is a forgotten word. If you can revitalise it, this will give dividends to the people of the whole region,’ he said while SAARC secretary general Golam Sarwar called on him at his office in Tejgaon. Sarwar thanked Yunus for being a big supporter of the SAARC and said that they were encouraged by his recent call to South Asian leaders for the revival of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. He briefed the Bangladesh chief adviser about the ongoing activities of SAARC at the working level, including the Programming Committee, Governing Bodies of Regional Centres and Specialised Bodies, events on climate change, SDGs, regional integration, customs cooperation, among others. He said that in the absence of high-level meetings, the functional initiatives were not getting adequate strength and clarity. Yunus and the SAARC secretary general discussed the need for meetings of foreign secretaries, foreign ministers, and other sectoral ministers, and even the summit of the leaders for better functioning of the body. ‘We have partnerships with a lot of organisations. We are trying to explore those,’ said the SAARC secretary general. The chief adviser asked the secretary general to work on multilateral issues such as the export of hydroelectric power of Nepal to neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, India, and Bhutan. He invited young people from SAARC countries to join the youth festival in Bangladesh in January. ‘This will be good because this focuses on youth. The whole SAARC idea is to bring people together. This could be one way of opening the door,’ the chief adviser said. This year, SAARC celebrates the historic 40th Charter Day. The SAARC secretary general requested continued support and guidance from the Bangladesh government for reinvigorating the SAARC process in realising the charter objectives of the association.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/251798/bangladesh-interim-govt-chief-yunus-for-revitalising-saarc

Broken justice system of Bangladesh needs to be fixed: Shafiqul Alam,"Chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam has said Bangladesh needs to fix a lot of things, including its ‘broken’ criminal justice system so that they can ensure justice to every suspect. ‘The biggest thing we need is to fix our broken criminal justice system so that we can ensure justice to every suspect,’ he said. In a Facebook post from his verified account on Monday, Alam said that for decades, justice has been hijacked by ‘custodial threats and tortures’ and by a corrupt and largely politically influenced police investigation system. The bigger issue here is custodial torture and forcible extraction of confessions to prove charges against suspects, he observed. ‘Unless we fix this dangerously inept system, no one is safe in Bangladesh,’ Alam said. The press secretary said anyone can be framed for any murder charges here and can be hanged with massive clippings by an easily manipulated mob.

SC stays HC order declaring August 15 as National Mourning Day,"The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on Sunday stayed a High Court order that declared August 15 as a national holiday in observance of National Mourning Day in 2008. A six-member bench, headed by Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, passed the order after hearing an appeal submitted challenging the HC order, said additional attorney general Barrister Anik R Haq. The state submitted the appeal against the HC order, he said. In 1996, the then Awami League government declared August 15, the day of the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and some of his family members, as a national mourning day and a public holiday. However, the four-party alliance government, led by Bangladesh Nationalist Party, scrapped the national mourning day and holiday in 2002. In 2008, AL-backed three lawyers filed a writ petition with the HC, and the court declared the BNP-led government’s decision invalid, restoring the observance of National Mourning Day and the public holiday.

Dhaka becomes 5th most polluted city with AQI score of 183,"Dhaka, the overcrowded capital city of Bangladesh, has ranked the fifth on the list of cities with the worst air quality with an AQI score of 183 at 9:00am on Monday morning. Monday’s air was classified as ‘unhealthy’, according to the AQI index. When the AQI value for particle pollution is between 50 and 100, air quality is considered ‘moderate’, usually sensitive individuals should consider limiting prolonged outdoor exertion, between 101 and 150, air quality is considered ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’, between 150 and 200 is ‘unhealthy’, between 201 and 300 is said to be ‘very unhealthy’, while a reading of 301 and above is considered ‘hazardous’, posing serious health risks to residents. India’s Delhi’s, Pakistan’s Lahore and again Pakistan’s Karachi occupied the first, second and third spots respectively on the list, with AQI scores of 260, 241 and 193 respectively. The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. The AQI in Bangladesh is based on five pollutants — particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon. As per World Health Organisation, air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, mainly due to increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/environment-climate-change/251791/dhaka-becomes-5th-most-polluted-city-with-aqi-score-of-183

Bangladesh Secretariat Officers and Employees United Council president Md Badiul Kabir announced the decision on Sunday at a press briefing, following a meeting with the senior secretary of the ministry of public administration and the land secretary at the secretariat. The council had earlier planned the rally to demand financial benefits for ‘long-deprived’ officials, a 50 per cent dearness allowance until a new pay commission is formed, reinstatement of the time scale and selection grade, reintroduction of rationing, an increase in the retirement age, changes to designations, and timely promotions. ‘Tensions has been rising within the secretariat. Our demands were acknowledged as logical during discussions with the public administration secretary, land secretary, and other senior officials. They assured us that these issues would be addressed in phases through dialogue. So, we have decided to suspend the rally,’ Kabir said. Senior secretary of the public administration ministry Md Mokhlesur Rahman said that over 2,000 administrative and personal staff members at the secretariat had long been deprived of pay raises and promotions. ‘The nine demands are reasonable and achievable.

BMPCA urges govt to counter misinformation on social media,"The Bangladesh Mobile Phone Consumers’ Association has urged the government to take immediate measures to curb the spread of rumours and provocative content on social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. The association believes these efforts are critical to reducing the current socio-political unrest and its detrimental effects on the economy. In a press statement, BMPCA president Mohiuddin Ahmed highlighted that since the interim government assumed office, the dissemination of unverified and incendiary content, originating both domestically and from abroad, had significantly contributed to instability. ‘This has hindered economic progress by affecting business activities and discouraging investment.’ Mohiuddin noted that content from certain foreign sources, including neighbouring countries’ media outlets and expatriates of Bangladeshi origin, aimed to provoke unrest and spread misinformation among citizens. ‘It is the government’s responsibility to ensure national security and stability by halting the dissemination of such content,’ he said, urging prompt action, especially during the transitional phase of revising the country’s digital and cyber security laws. The association stressed that combating misinformation requires collective action from the government, regulatory bodies like BTRC and NTMC, mobile network operators, internet service providers, and other stakeholders. They called for greater participation from both public and private sectors in raising awareness and maintaining societal harmony.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251788/bmpca-urges-govt-to-counter-misinformation-on-social-media

Lawyers want Chinmoy to be prime accused,"Chattogram lawyers on Sunday in the port city staged demonstrations demanding inclusion of arrested Hindu community leader Chinmoy Krishna Das’ name as the prime accused in the murder case filed over the killing of lawyer Saiful Islam Alif. They also expressed anger at the fact that Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, formerly a leader of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, in short ISKCON, was not even named in the case statement. Assistant public prosecutor in Chattogram Saiful  Islam Alif was hacked to death near Chattogram Court Building area on November 26 during clashes between members of law enforcement agencies and followers of Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote spokesperson Chinmoy Krishna Das. Chinmoy Krishna’s bail hearing in a sedition case is scheduled for tomorrow amid protests in Chattogram and elsewhere across the country. Addressing a condolence rally in front of Sonali Bank on the court premises, Chattogram District Bar Association president Nazim Uddin Chowdhury said that Chinmoy Das should have been named as an accused in all the related cases, including the murder case filed over the lawyer killing, and the one filed over the November 26 clash on a Chattogram court premises. ‘We firmly believe Chinmoy Das should be the prime accused in all these cases. The lawyer community will not tolerate his exclusion from cases,’ said Nazim, adding that there was clear evidence in video footage and eyewitness accounts. They also demanded prompt investigation into the murder case and submission of charge sheet at the earliest. ‘We will continue our protest till justice for advocate Saiful’s murder is delivered,’ he said. Earlier in the day, lawyers, wearing black badges, staged a protest march that started from in front of the Sonali Bank on the court premises, passed through Laldighi and the Hawkers Market, and concluded in front of Doel Bhaban. The court of Metropolitan Sessions Judge Md Saiful Islam is scheduled to hear Chinmoy’s bail petition on Tuesday as the hearings on Wednesday and Thursday were not held amid boycott by lawyers, said Monir Hossen Sarker, bench assistant of the court. Earlier, on November 26, the Sixth Metropolitan Magistrate Court of Chattogram rejected Chinmoy’s bail in a sedition case and ordered him to be sent to jail. Five cases were filed so far over Saiful Islam Alif’s killing near court premises and vandalism and other offences. The police have filed three of the cases and victim families filed the rest two, while 38 people, including nine in connection with Saiful killing, have been arrested. Four days after the lawyer had been hacked to death, victim’s father Jamal Uddin filed a murder case with the Kotwali police against 31 named and 10–15 unidentified people on Saturday. Saiful’s elder brother Khane Alam filed another case with the same police over attacks and vandalism perpetrated on a Chattogram court premises against 116 named individuals and 400–500 unnamed people.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251785/lawyers-want-chinmoy-to-be-prime-accused
Govts blamed for delay in treaty execution,"The ineffectiveness of the bodies formed under the Chittagong Hill Tracts peace accord has been delaying the full execution of the treaty signed about three decades ago, national minority leaders and rights activists have said. For its effective implementation, they have said that initiatives from the professor Muhammad Yunus-led interim government are crucial to activate all relevant bodies, including the CHT Land Commission having no chairperson since August 2023, the CHT Accord Implementation and Monitoring Committee, and the advisory committee of the CHT affairs ministry. The frustrating delay in the treaty’s execution was increasing uncertainty of the national minorities in the hill districts of Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachari, they observe. Describing the ‘CHT issues as both national and political’, ethnic minorities and activists emphasise that the full implementation of the accord, popularly known as the peace treaty, signed 27 years ago to establish peace  and rights in the region, is crucial for the greater interest of Bangladesh. They blame the ineffectiveness of the CHT land commission as a major barrier against ensuring their rights to land ownership, a crucial issue for the hill people mostly depending on land for their livelihoods. They have also underlined the need for handing over responsibilities through executive orders to the regional and district councils for each hill district under the ‘CHT special governance system’. ‘After the interim government took charge, all bodies established under the CHT accord became non-functional and till now remain so, which is dangerous as it has heightened uncertainty regarding the full implementation of the treaty,’ Khairul Chowdhury, joint coordinator of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Accord Implementation Movement, told New Age. He added that the situation led to growing disappointment and frustration among the national minority communities in the hills. Particularly, the ineffectiveness of the CHT Land Dispute Resolution Commission, formed in 1999 under the provision of the treaty, as it had no chairman now and lacked corresponding rules under the law, has deprived many national minority people of their land, heightening the instability in the region. ‘Land dispute is the prime problem of the CHT. A major part of the inhabitants have become landless due to the ineffectiveness of the land commission,’ observes KS Mong, a member of the CHT Regional Council. The CHT Land Dispute Resolution Commission Act 2001 was amended in 2016 to recognise the customary rights of the region’s national minority communities and resolve land disputes in accordance with the law, customs and practices in force in the CHT. But over 22,000 land dispute applications from the national minorities remained unresolved as corresponding rules under the law are yet to be formulated, the speakers said. ‘Resolving the land dispute is essential to give the special governance system, incorporating the CHT Regional Council and the three hill district councils, an institutional shape,’ said KS Mong, also a central committee member of the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti. He explains that a voter list needs to be created for an independent election for the CHT Regional Council that has been operating under an interim committee, and that a person must have a permanent address and ownership of land legally in order to be eligible to vote. To mark the 27 years of the treaty today, government, several organisations of national minorities and rights activists have announced programmes, including discussion events. National minority leaders have also said that fundamental issues, including land problems, withdrawal of army camps, resettlement of Bangalee settlers, and self-governance, were not addressed in keeping with the accord in these 27 years. Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs adviser Supradip Chakma could not be reached for a comment over phone. Abul Hasanat Abdullah, then chief whip of the Jatiya Sangsad and convener of the National Committee on CHT, and Jyotirindra Bodhipriya Larma, better known as Santu Larma, who heads the PCJSS, signed the accord respectively on behalf of the then AL-led government and the ‘residents of the CHT’ in the presence of then prime minister Sheikh Hasina on December 2, 1997. The accord was signed to end the armed conflicts between the ethnic communities and the security forces with promises to protect the hill people’s land rights and the revival and conservation of their cultural uniqueness. The accord was also aimed at rehabilitating people displaced due to the conflict and repatriating those who had left the country, limiting the presence of security forces, and setting up regional and district councils headed by representatives mostly from the national minority communities.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251784/govts-blamed-for-delay-in-treaty-execution
Pakistan cruise to opening T20 win over Zimbabwe,"An unbeaten fifth-wicket stand of 65 by Tayyab Tahir and Irfan Khan set up Pakistan for a 57-run victory over Zimbabwe on Sunday in the first of three Twenty20 internationals. Pakistan, who are chase a white-ball double in Zimbabwe having already won the ODI series 2-1, won the toss in Bulawayo and posted 165-4 while Zimbabwe were all out for 108 in 15.3 overs. The tourists were 100-4 with 34 deliveries remaining at Queens Sports Club when Tahir and Khan came together to slam a rapid 65 runs as they punished poor bowling and careless fielding. Tahir made 39, including a six and four fours, to be joint top scorer with Usman Khan, who struck four boundaries, two of them sixes. Irfan Khan finished on 27 from 15 balls with three fours. ‘Irfan and I were talking to each other and decided to run hard, hit every ball and if we cannot make a six, then run,’ player of the match Tahir told reporters. Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza, who top-scored for his side with 39, said: ‘To leak 40-odd runs in the last few overs shifted the momentum. To be all out for 108 is a really tough pill to swallow.’ The Pakistan-born all-rounder was the pick of the bowlers, with his deceptive spin capturing the wicket of Pakistan skipper Salman Agha (13). In reply, Tadiwanashe Marumani and Raza raised Zimbabwean hopes when they put on 59 runs for the third wicket. But soon after Marumani was run out by Usman Khan for 33, Raza was caught at backward point by Saim Ayub and the innings collapsed with the last four wickets falling for only 13 runs. After Jahandad Khan claimed the prize wicket of Raza, Sufiyan Muqeem wreaked havoc with the Zimbabwe tail, capturing three wickets. The two sides meet again on Tuesday and Thursday.

Seizure of S Alam Group shares ordered,"The Chattogram Artha Rin Adalat has ordered the seizure of shares held by S Alam Group chairman Saiful Alam and his brother Abdus Samad with two banks, in connection with a Tk 2,000 crore loan default at Janata Bank. The court also directed the Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate the circumstances surrounding the massive loan irregularities. Judge Mujahidur Rahman of the Chattogram Money Loan Court issued the order on Sunday, said plaintiff’s lawyer Md Shafiqul Islam Chowdhury. The shares in question are held at Al-Arafah Islami Bank and First Security Islami Bank, Shafiqul Islam said. Shafiqul Islam said, ‘S Alam has shares of First Security Islami Bank, while his brother Abdus Samad Lavu owns shares of Al Arafah Islami Bank. The court has instructed the seizure of these shares based on our application. Additionally, the ACC has been tasked with probing how such a significant irregularity in the Tk 2,000 crore loan occurred.’ The case was filed earlier in the day by Satyajit Ghosh, an officer at Janata Bank’s head office and its Sadharan Bima Bhaban Corporate Branch. According to a 2021 audit report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of Bangladesh, Global Trading Corporation, a subsidiary of S Alam Group, has secured loans exceeding the approved limit in violation of Bangladesh Bank regulations. Initially, in 2012, the company obtained a loan of Tk 650 crore from Janata Bank’s Chattogram Corporate Branch at Sadharan Bima Bhaban.

Tarique acquitted in 2 cases in Sylhet,"A Sylhet court on Sunday acquitted Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting chairman Tarique Rahman in two cases filed against him on charge of sedition in 2014. Sylhet Bar Association member Emran Ahmed Chowdhury, also the district BNP general secretary, confirmed the court order to New Age. He said that the Sylhet metropolitan magistrate Sagir Ahmed acquitted Tarique Rahman and dismissed the cases in the afternoon after holding a hearing in this regard. ‘The court dismissed the two cases because the cases were filed intentionally for political harassment,’ Emran said. On December 22 in 2014, the two cases were filed against the then BNP vice-chairman Tarique Rahman with the Sylhet metropolitan magistrate 3rd court. One of the cases was filed by M Raihan Ahmed Chowdhury, former general secretary of the district unit of Bangladesh Chhatra League while another case was filed by Shamim Molla, former president of the Sylhet Agricultural University unit of the BCL. Plaintiffs in the cases alleged that Tarique Rahman had distorted the history of independence, sovereignty and the liberation war of Bangladesh, and criticised Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at a discussion programme at East London of the United Kingdom on December 15, 2014. The then magistrate of the metropolitan 3rd court, Anwarul Haque, had taken the two cases in cognizance and ordered the officer-in-charge of Shah Paran Police Station of the Sylhet Metropolitan Police to submit investigation reports in the cases.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/251781/tarique-acquitted-in-2-cases-in-sylhet
Mbappe strikes as Real Madrid beat Getafe,"Spanish champions Real Madrid beat Getafe 2-0 to move second in La Liga on Sunday with Kylian Mbappe finding the net after a difficult week. The French striker has been criticised in recent weeks for his form but after Jude Bellingham opened the scoring from the penalty spot, Mbappe slotted home a well-taken second. Later, Mbappe wasted three other big chances but Madrid were able to move within one point of league leaders Barcelona, who lost on Saturday at home against Las Palmas. Carlo Ancelotti's side have played one fewer game than the Catalans, and Atletico Madrid, third, who are one point behind. ‘(Mbappe) played very well, he was active, dangerous as always,’ said Ancelotti. ‘He scored an important goal, he created chances in the second half and had a very active game, it's what we want from him.’ Mbappe, playing in his favoured role on the left with Vinicius Junior out injured, was offered plenty of support by Madrid's fans. ‘The fans understand more than anyone what moment the team is in, and the players (are in),’ added Ancelotti. Getafe set out to slow the game down and they largely succeeded until Allan Nyom tugged down Antonio Rudiger in the area after half an hour. After Mbappe missed his penalty against Liverpool in the Champions League defeat at Anfield on Wednesday, Bellingham stepped up to take the spot-kick. The England international outfoxed David Soria to send Madrid ahead on the half-hour with his third goal in three league games. ‘Today Bellingham or Mbappe had to choose (who took the penalty), they both chose Bellingham,’ said Ancelotti. Mbappe doubled his team's lead with a superb strike seven minutes prior to the break, after Bellingham spread the ball out to him on the left flank. The France captain drove inside and curled home a low effort inside the far post for his eighth league goal of the season. Ancelotti took off Bellingham at half-time because of an apparent knock sustained in a collision with Soria, but later said he thought the midfielder would recover quickly. Mbappe produced a glorious chipped pass to put Brahim Diaz in behind early in the second period, but the Morocco international's effort sailed narrowly over the crossbar. The forward came millimetres away from scoring a second himself but after rounding Soria squeezed a shot just wide of the far post. Soria made a good save to deny Fede Valverde as Getafe battled to keep the scoreline respectable. Mbappe spurned another chance to score when he fired off-target after being played in again, but Getafe could not capitalise on his profligacy. John Patrick had the visitors' best chance with a powerful effort which hit the crossbar then the post. Mbappe had another chance in stoppage time but misfired from close range as his anxiety to prove his worth in a Madrid shirt following his summer move from Paris Saint-Germain continued to tell, despite his goal. Madrid face Athletic Bilbao in midweek, hoping to build on their run of three consecutive La Liga wins. ‘We've had a lot of injuries (but) we are there fighting, battling,’ said Ancelotti. ‘What gives me the most confidence is that we had a good attitude again, concentration, we had spirit. ‘Bit by bit the problems we've had, we will solve, and in the meanwhile we will be there fighting.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/251780/mbappe-strikes-as-real-madrid-beat-getafe
End political vengeance: Tarique,"Hours after his acquittal by the High Court in the August 21 grenade attack case, Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting chairman Tarique Rahman on Sunday said that the beauty of truth is that it inevitably triumphed over propaganda and conspiracy. ‘Let us unite to end political vengeance and open a new chapter in history, where no one’s life or family will be destroyed because of political differences,’ Tarique said in a status in his verified Facebook profile. ‘We pledge to uphold the spirit of democracy that thrives on diversity of faiths, beliefs, and ideologies, empowering the people of Bangladesh to define their own fate through electoral participation,’ he added. ‘In that journey, we aspire to establish the rule of law, human rights, and freedom of expression, safeguarding the rights and liberties of every citizen and building an inclusive, tolerant, and rules-based society,’ he said. BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Sunday expressed his relief over the acquittal of BNP Tarique Rahman and all accused in the August 21 grenade attack case. In a statement given from London, he said, ‘It has been proved that all the cases against Tarique Rahman were conspiratorial.’ ‘I express my gratitude to Allah for the judgment by High Court bench of Justice AKM Asaduzzaman and Justice Syed Enayet Hussain, cancelling the judgment of the trial court,’ he said. He said that this judgment proves that the Awami fascist government made Tarique Rahman accused in this case with political motives. ‘Tarique Rahman has been acquitted by the High Court after his dealing with the charges brought against him. Through the historic judgment, it has been proved once again that all the cases brought against Tarique Rahman were political conspiracies,’ he added. On the other hand, addressing a programme in Dhaka, BNP standing committee Mirza Abbas said that the party acting chairman Tarique will return to the country soon. He gave this information at a discussion at the National Press Club. ‘The case was based on false and concocted stories. It was a planned conspiracy by a foreign power. Justice has now been served,’ Abbas said. ‘Tarique Rahman will come back to us. His long suffering is about to end. Allah kept him healthy and freed him. BNP will always work for democracy and justice,’ he said. Abbas highlighted the importance of independent journalism and said, ‘We want freedom of the press, but we don’t want bad journalism.’ Democracy and independent journalism are complementary to each other, he said, adding that many BNP leaders were victims of bad journalism in previous time. On August 21, 2004, at least 24 people were killed and about 300 others injured in a grenade attack on the Awami League rally in Dhaka’s Bangabandhu Avenue. On October 10, 2018, a court in Dhaka sentenced 19 people to death, including former BNP home minister Lutfuzzaman Babar, in two cases filed in connection with the grenade attack. 19 people including Tarique Rahman, who is currently in London, were sentenced to life imprisonment and 11 others to different terms.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/251779/end-political-vengeance-tarique-

Energy sector destroyed to benefit AL cronies,"The immediate-past Awami League government manipulated the power and energy sector by all means possible to benefit its cronies, opening windows for them to pocket public money and then launder it in full awareness of the consequences their actions would bring, revealed the white paper on economy submitted to the interim government on Sunday. Using fictitious and unrealistic data, the government set ambitious economic growth targets, leading to mismatched and excessive growth in generation, transmission and distribution capacities that only helped inflate power and energy bills. While people suffered from inflation and industries lost competitiveness as a result, the immunity provided under the special provision act of 2010 gave Awami League’s political allies and financiers to go unchallenged, the white paper said. As of October 2024, the total dues in energy and power sector is approximately Tk 50,000 crore or $4.16 billion, excluding dues to the National Board of Revenue, against $30 billion invested between 2009 and 2022 in power sector alone, the whitepaper said. In a conservative estimate, the whitepaper noted, $3 billion changed hands in kickbacks. ‘Many argued that these violations fostered a group of crony capitalists in the country who benefited from government patronage and were also involved in the transfer of wealth out of Bangladesh,’ read a line of the white paper prepared by a committee of 12 members. The transmission and distribution system, the daily and seasonal load management, primary energy supply, physical infrastructure of fuel import, storage and transport—all aspects of an integrated system were neglected in the planning of the energy and power sector. The sector was run under monopolistic state companies completely controlled by bureaucrats and Awami leaders who awarded favours to their acquaintances without facing almost any resistance from the public or the political opposition. For instance on how the favours took place, the white paper stated that tariff fixing was not well defined. For independent power producers and rentals, the tariff was ‘negotiated’. Irrespective of investment, the tariff negotiation was done by benchmarking previously tendered tariff or other negotiated deals, allowing favourable rates, terms and conditions to political and business cronies of the Prime Minister’s Office, energy adviser, state minister, secretaries and other key officials. ‘Apart from excess profit, it is suspected that many of these projects were used for money laundering by overvaluing project costs,’ the whitepaper inferred. The misalignment that comprised the generation capacity far exceeding actual needs and heavy import reliance for fuel had led to an excess investment of approximately $4.48 billion in the sector. Taking advantage of guaranteed payment such as capacity charge, the capacity market was flooded with over supply through unprecedented corruption. The total capacity or rental payment to private sector from 2010–11 to 2023–24 was approximately Tk 1.15 lakh crore. The overall plant factor of the total system varied between 42 per cent and 46 per cent in the last five years. A 65 per cent plant factor is achievable by minimising maintenance, reducing standby capacity and full supply of fuel. The rental plants that were awarded in 2010–11 made as high as 35 per cent profit against a standard 15 per cent. Another instance of the government favour awarded to allies was the tariff given to the 200MW unsolicited Teesta solar plant of Beximco, awarded in 2016. It was granted a tariff of $0.015/kWh in 2023, whereas all other plants were offering $0.010/kWh due to reduced panel costs and much higher efficiency. The situation was no better in the gas sector. Since September 2020, Rupantorito Prakritik Gas Company Limited bought 74 LNG cargos through 100 tenders through 12 companies though 23 companies were enlisted. Out of the 12 companies, three companies received orders for 59 cargos, indicating preferential treatment or collusion. Even a few cents overpricing in the unit gas price would net millions of dollars for the unscrupulous parties, the whitepaper said. Until August 2024, 69 cargos of 225.4 million MMBTU LNG were imported from the spot market at an average cost of $16/MMBTU totalling $3.6 billion. A 50 cent kickback would net more than $100 million. Under Hasina’s leadership, the energy adviser, state minister Nasrul Hamid Bipu, and the power division were the conduit of corruption. Every single deal from a small solar plant to a mega project like Adani was approved by the Prime Minister’s Office. Now 65 per cent primary energy needs to be imported at an annual cost of $10 billion, and by 2030 this will rise to $20 billion. The whitepaper called the Rooppur nuclear power plant a misadventure. In comparison, India’s nuclear power unit cost is $3,350/kWe, while the unit cost for Rooppur stands at $5,500/kWe. The national grid is not even ready to handle nuclear power. The white paper advised that the government to explore renewable energy seriously through 2030 to relieve some of the burden. Gas exploration has also been emphasised to bring down energy costs.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251777/energy-sector-destroyed-to-benefit-al-cronies-

Banks’ distress asset stands at Tk 6.75 lakh crore,"Distressed assets in Bangladesh’s banking sector surpassed Tk 6.75 lakh crore at the end of FY24, an amount equivalent to the cost of 13.5 Dhaka Metro systems or 22.5 Padma Bridges, according to a draft White Paper released on Sunday. Debapriya Bhattacharya, head of the 12-memebr committee formed to prepare the much-talked-about paper submitted to chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus on the day. The interim government that assumed power on August 8, three days after deposed prime minister Shekh Hasina fled to India on August 5 amid a mass uprising, appointed the committee on August 28 and asked it to submit the report in 90 days. The report highlights that the banking sector’s woes are not due to isolated incidents but stem from systemic failures and regulatory loopholes that enabled widespread malpractice. Distressed assets include non-performing loan, rescheduled, restructured, writ ten-off, and litigated loans. The review of the White Paper puts the banking sector on top of the most corruption-ravaged sectors, followed by physical infrastructure, and energy and power. ‘Persistent loan defaults and high profile scams have eroded financial stability and diverted capital away from productive sectors,’ it said. A fragmented regulatory system allowed significant embezzlement through fake companies or loans granted without proper documentation. This privilege was often extended to large borrowers, including politically connected entities. ‘The culprits within the banking system are all heavy weights. The big ones coincide with the bad ones,’ it said. Related-party lending, a glaring issue, has contributed significantly to the crisis. Directors often arranged reciprocal loans, bypassing weak restrictions on lending to related parties. By the end of 2023, such practices among directors of eight banks alone accounted for Tk 45,000 crore. Politically connected borrowers frequently secured massive loans with insufficient collateral, evading legal repercussions due to a culture of impunity and political influence. Recognised non-performing loans (NPLs) alone reached Tk 2.11 lakh crore by June 2024 — equivalent to the cost of seven Padma Bridges. These inflated figures highlight the entrenched inefficiency and fragility within the banking system. The problem worsened as rescheduling and restructuring practices enabled borrowers with poor credit histories to continue accessing new loans. This lack of accountability reinforced a cycle of defaults and weakened overall financial stability. Even state-owned banks and politically connected private commercial banks have become persistent threats to the sector. The White Paper criticises the awarding of excessive banking licenses, which doubled over two decades, oversaturating the market. Many licenses were issued to oligarchs with close ties to the ruling party, exacerbating corruption. Boardrooms in several banks were filled with politically aligned or under-qualified individuals, further limiting effective governance. The lack of autonomy for Bangladesh Bank, coupled with inadequate oversight, compounded the crisis. Politically influenced decision-making undermined the central bank’s capacity to enforce monetary policy and regulatory measures. Weak internal and external audits only added to the problem, as technical expertise was often sidelined. Non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) also faced severe distress. By September 2023, 29.8 per cent of their disbursed loans, amounting to Tk 21,658 crore, were classified as non-performing. Just 10 NBFIs accounted for 67.5 per cent of this figure, underscoring the systemic challenges within the broader financial landscape.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251775/banks-distress-asset-stands-at-tk-6.75-lakh-crore

JKKNIU brings ‘The Rules of Love’ to stage,"Theatre and performance studies department of Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University staged its production titled The Rules of Love at the Zia Haider Lab of the university in Mymensingh on Sunday. The play is an adaptation of Nigel Watts’s novel titled The Way of Love and Elif Shafak’s novel titled The Forty Rules of Love. It has been adapted, designed and directed by the department’s assistant professor Mahedi Tanjir. The play depicts the story of a middle-aged woman named Ella who reads a writer’s manuscript about the Sufi poets Shams-i Tabrizi and Jalal al-Din Muḥammad Rumi. Her interaction with the author creates a new dimension in her life, and the play moves forward. ‘The spiritual journey of Ella and Rumi depicted in the play inspires us to search for the truth instead of struggling with the problems of life,’ said Mahedi Tanjir. The students of 2019-20 sessions of the department have acted different characters in the play. The play is scheduled to be staged at the same venue until December 5.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/theatre/251772/jkkniu-brings-the-rules-of-love-to-stage
Dengue death toll nears 500 this year,"At least six more people died of dengue and 882 affected were hospitalised in the past 24 hours till 8:00am on Sunday, according to the Directorate General of Health Services press release. Of the deaths, two died in Chattogram division and one each in Dhaka, Barishal, Rajshahi divisions and Dhaka South City Corporation area. Of the dead, three are male. Including the latest figure, dengue deaths rose to 494 since January this year while the total hospitalisation was reported 92,351 across the country. Of the deaths, 14 died in January, three in February, five in March, two in April, two in May, eight in June, 12 in July, 27 in August, 80 in September, 134 in October and 173 in November and six on the first day of December. Of the hospitalisation this year, 1,055 were reported in January, 339 in February, 311 in March, 504 in April, 644 in May, 798 in June, 2,669 in July, 6,521 in August, 18,097 in September, 30, 879 in October, 58,361 in November and 882 in the first day of December. According to the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research’s latest virus surveillance report, out of four dengue virus serotypes three — DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-3 has been prevailing in the country this year. The IEDCR director Professor Tahmina Shirin, referring to a recent surveillance report completed in October, said that this year DENV-2 is dominating serotype of dengue which is 70 per cent of total. While serotype DENV-3 is 20 per cent and the rest were infected with DENV-4. Entomologists observed that dengue patients are on the rise largely due to the inactivity of the authorities concerned. The National Institute of Preventive and Social Medicine entomology department head Professor Md Golam Sharower said that public engagement and effective anti-mosquito drive are must for overcoming the situation. Dengue killed 1,705 people and sent 3,21,179 people to hospitals in 2023 against 853 deaths and 2,44,246 hospitalisation between 2000 and 2022, the DGHS data showed. A dengue outbreak was first officially reported in the country in 2000 when 93 people died and 5,551 patients were hospitalised, according to DGHS data.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251771/dengue-death-toll-nears-500-this-year
Liverpool pile on misery on City,"Liverpool piled on the misery for Manchester City as the Premier League leaders beat the troubled champions 2-0 at Anfield, while Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim earned his first league win with a 4-0 rout of Everton on Sunday. Arne Slot's side moved nine points clear of second-placed Arsenal after Cody Gakpo's first-half opener and Mohamed Salah's late penalty dealt another blow to reeling City, who are languishing 11 points behind Liverpool in fifth place. City have lost four successive top-flight games for the first time since 2008, making them the first Premier League champions to endure such a dismal run the year after claiming the title. In the 32 Premier League seasons, only three times have teams come from 11 or more points behind at any point to win the title. City have clawed back significant deficits to win the Premier League in the Guardiola era, but they have never managed to lift the title after being behind by more than 10 points. City's seven-game winless run ranks as boss Pep Guardiola's longest barren streak in his glittering managerial career. Just weeks after he signed a new two-year contract, Liverpool fans taunted Guardiola with chants of ‘you're getting sacked in the morning’, prompting a defiant response from the Spaniard, who held up six fingers to illustrate the number of titles he has won with City. Liverpool have won 18 of their 20 games in all competitions since Slot replaced Jurgen Klopp in the close-season. The Reds have won 11 of their 13 Premier League matches and are firm favourites to win the title for the first time since 2020. Guardiola sprang a surprise by starting Stefan Ortega in goal instead of the dropped Ederson, but the German had to pick the ball out of his net after just 12 minutes. City's defence was in disarray as Salah curled a shot towards the far post and Gakpo pounced to poke home from virtually on the line. Salah's 78th-minute penalty, awarded for Ortega's foul on Luis Diaz, was a dagger in the heart of City's title hopes. Amorim stole the spotlight in Sunday's early games by extending his unbeaten start with United to three matches. United were held to a 1-1 draw at Ipswich in his first Premier League game last Sunday, before the Portuguese boss earned his maiden win with United in a 3-2 success against Bodo/Glimt at Old Trafford in the Europa League on Thursday.The 39-year-old, who arrived from Sporting Lisbon to replace the sacked Erik ten Hag in November, has warned United would ‘suffer for a long period’ before they can expect to challenge for the title. This was the most encouraging result of Amorim's brief time at ninth-placed United as they recovered from a slow start to dispatch lowly Everton. Marcus Rashford's 34th-minute drive from the edge of the area took a deflection off Jarrad Branthwaite before flashing into the net. United struck again seven minutes later as Branthwaite lost possession to Amad Diallo and Bruno Fernandes teed up Joshua Zirkzee to convert with ease. Rashford underlined United's superiority just 20 seconds after the interval as he applied a cool finish to Diallo's incisive pass for his seventh goal this season. Zirkee struck again in the 64th minute with a composed strike from the influential Diallo's assist after shambolic Everton defending. ‘The result was good but we were pragmatic. It was not pretty,’ Amorim said. ‘It is a rollercoaster. We have some moments when we are good but then we have moments when we have to suffer.’ At Stamford Bridge, Chelsea extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to six games with a 3-0 win against Aston Villa, whose dismal winless streak reached eight matches. Enzo Maresca's men look capable of securing Champions League qualification after a third successive win in the space of eight days moved them level on points with second-placed Arsenal. Nicolas Jackson and Enzo Fernandez scored in the first half before Cole Palmer struck in the closing stages. Seventh-placed Tottenham's top four hopes were dented by a 1-1 draw against 10-man Fulham. Brennan Johnson slotted Tottenham into the lead from Timo Werner's 54th-minute pass, but Tom Cairney curled Fulham's equaliser into the far corner after 67 minutes. Cairney was sent off with seven minutes left after his foul on Dejan Kulusevski was upgraded from referee Darren Bond's initial yellow card to a red after VAR intervened.

Primary students to get all books in Jan: adviser,"Primary and mass education adviser professor Bidhan Ranjan Roy Podder said that primary level students would receive 100 per cent textbooks in January, but there would be no celebrations before. ‘There are questions about the quality of teachers, recruited before nationalisation of primary schools in 2013. However, the physical infrastructures of primary schools and general quality of teachers have improved,’ he said. The adviser was talking to local reporters at the inauguration ceremony of a two-day workshop, organised by the Directorate of Primary Education on the RDRS premises in Rangpur Sunday afternoon. Director general of the directorate of primary education Md Abdul Hakim, its Rangpur divisional deputy director Md Azizur Rahman and assistant director Nazrul Islam were present. Later, Bidhan Ranjan attended the workshop titled ‘Fifth Phase Primary Education Development Programme’, organised by the department of primary education, as chief guest. ‘We’ve our own training programme. So, if a teacher has potential, then there is an opportunity to train him or her to improve performance,’ he said. ‘The fifth grade students should be able to do simple calculations, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and works are going towards that goal,’ he said. ‘While visiting different government primary schools in Nilphamari and Rangpur, I spoke to the teachers and students there. The school infrastructure is good, well-equipped, but attendance is not 100 per cent.’ ‘I hope that primary school students will get 100 per cent of the new textbooks in January. We may not be able to give them away with a festival like in the past,’ he continued. He said that there was no significant change in the syllabus in the primary school. ‘However, we have made some changes in the books for the third, fourth and fifth grades. Our fourth and fifth grade textbooks will reflect the uprising of the students and the public in the form of various stories and pictures,’ he added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251768/primary-students-to-get-all-books-in-jan-adviser
Khandaker Mosharraf acquitted in one more graft case,"Dhaka Special Judge’s Court-8 on Sunday acquitted former health minister and Bangladesh Nationalist Party standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain in a case filed on charges of amassing illegal wealth worth Tk 12.51 crore. Judge Md Monjurul Hossain handed down the verdict in the presence of the BNP leader in the case filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission in 2008 during the army-controlled caretaker government. The court said Mosharraf was acquitted from the charges of the case as the prosecution failed to prove the charges brought against him. After the verdict, Mosharraf expressed his satisfaction and told journalists at the court premises that he got justice from the court after 16 years. The ACC on January 10, 2008, filed a case with Ramna Police Station against Mosharraf and his wife, Bilkis Hossain, over allegations of amassing illegal wealth worth Tk 12.51 crore and concealing information about Tk 3.11 crore in their wealth statements submitted to the ACC. ACC submitted a charge sheet against the couple on April 13, 2008. But the trial proceeding against Bilkis was quashed by the High Court following her writ petition against the order of framing charge. On November 28, another Dhaka court acquitted Mosharraf and two others in a case filed over misappropriating Tk 49,07,808 from the national exchequer by misusing a World Bank fund. Mosharraf was also acquitted in the Barapukuria coal mine corruption case on November 27. On August 22, he was also acquitted in another case filed on charges of laundering over Tk 9.53 crore to the United Kingdom.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251767/khandaker-mosharraf-acquitted-in-one-more-graft-case

Kuwait urges ‘immediate ceasefire’ for Gaza at Gulf summit,"Kuwait’s ruler on Sunday urged an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, as he addressed a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council held after nearly 14 months of war in the Palestinian territory. Emir Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Sabah called on the international community to implement ‘an immediate ceasefire, providing international protection for innocent civilians and ensuring the opening of safe corridors and the arrival of urgent humanitarian aid’. The meeting of the six-member GCC comes at a time of acute and on-going uncertainty for the Middle East following Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel and a subsequent war on Gaza, which has repeatedly threatened spill-over into a wider regional conflagration. The Palestinian health ministry said the Israeli army killed two people in the occupied West Bank on Sunday, after Israel’s military announced a strike in the area of Jenin. The ministry said in a statement two people were killed ‘due to the occupation’s aggression on the village of Siir in the Jenin district’, referring to Israel. Sheikh Meshal hit out at what he characterised as the ‘double standards in the application of relevant international laws, charters and resolutions’ which he said had undermined ‘the region’s security and stability’. He said Kuwait was ‘optimistic’ about a ceasefire agreed between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon that he said would contribute ‘to reducing escalation in the region’. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar and other countries also welcomed last week’s a truce after a year of conflict that killed thousands in Lebanon and caused mass displacement on both sides of the border. Fighting escalated in September after continuous cross-border strikes, initiated by Iran-backed Hezbollah in support of Hamas. The Kuwaiti ruler spoke in support of Saudi’s work to form a global body pushing for an independent Palestinian state and lauded ‘positive and constructive’ work by Iran and the GCC. Saudi Arabia had appeared close to a normalisation deal with Israel prior to October 2023 but Riyadh indicated it was unwilling to move ahead while Israel pursued its campaign in Gaza, hardening its position in recent months saying it would not recognise Israel without an independent Palestinian state. Anxious about being drawn into tit-for-tat strikes between Israel and nearby Iran, also precipitated by fighting in Gaza, the wealthy and traditionally western-allied Gulf monarchies have sought to cultivate improved relations with Tehran. An Israeli air raid on Iran in October was the most recent in a series of retaliatory attacks between the two countries. Meanwhile, Hamas’s armed wing published a video Saturday of an American-Israeli hostage held in Gaza since the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. In the video, whose date cannot be verified, Edan Alexander addresses US president-elect Donald Trump in English and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Hebrew. He calls on Israelis to put pressure on the government to secure the release of the hostages seized on October 7. ‘This video has upset me, but beyond the hope it gives us, it shows how bad the situation is for Edan and the other hostages and how much they are crying out and hoping to be saved now,’ his mother, Yael Alexander, said during a speech at a rally for the hostages in Tel Aviv Saturday evening.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/251763/kuwait-urges-immediate-ceasefire-for-gaza-at-gulf-summit
Divided plastic pollution negotiators call for more time,"Negotiators have failed to reach agreement on a landmark treaty to curb plastic pollution and need more time to continue discussions, the diplomat chairing the talks said on Sunday. Nearly 200 nations are in South Korea’s Busan for negotiations that are supposed to result in the world’s first accord on the issue after two years of discussions. But a week of talks has failed to resolve deep divisions between ‘high-ambition’ countries seeking a globally binding agreement to limit production and phase out harmful chemicals, and ‘like-minded’, mostly oil-producing nations who want to focus on waste. Plastic production is on track to triple by 2060, and more than 90 per cent of plastic is not recycled. A draft text released Sunday afternoon after multiple delays included a wide range of options, making clear the ongoing level of disagreement. When an open plenary session finally convened late Sunday night, chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso said progress had been made. But he said ‘we must also recognise that a few critical issues still prevent us from reaching a comprehensive agreement.’ ‘These unresolved issues remain challenging and additional time will be needed to address them effectively,’ he said. ‘There is a general agreement to resume the current session at a later date to conclude our negotiations.’ Several nations took to the floor to support the call for more time — but their agreement ended there. Rwandan delegate Juliet Kabera spoke of ‘strong concerns about ongoing calls by a small group of countries to remove binding provisions from the text that are indispensable for the treaty to be effective.’ She delivered a statement on behalf of dozens of countries, demanding a treaty that would require targets to reduce production and phase out chemicals of concern. ‘A treaty that lacks these elements and only relies on voluntary measures would not be acceptable,’ she said, inviting supporting delegations to stand up to extensive applause from the plenary room. Iran however warned it remained unhappy with proposals on those issues and others, warning of the ‘huge gap’ between parties. ‘We need to be assured that when we come together again, we will be allowed to add, introduce our own new languages, and to put into brackets any part or paragraph,’ its delegate said. That raised the prospect that any new talks could follow the pattern seen in Busan, where repeated attempts by the chair to synthesise and streamline text encountered resistance. Earlier, delegations seeking an ambitious treaty warned that a handful of countries were steadfastly blocking progress. A French minister accused the like-minded group of ‘continuing obstruction,’ while Fiji’s Sivendra Michael called out a ‘very minority group’ for ‘blocking the process.’ While countries have declined to directly name those preventing a deal, public statements and submissions have shown Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia have sought to block production cuts and other ambitious goals. None of the delegations have responded to repeated AFP requests for comment. Portuguese delegate Maria Joao Teixeira said earlier Sunday that another round of talks might be the best option for a meaningful deal. ‘We are really trying to not have a weak treaty,’ she said. But environmental groups had pushed ambitious countries to call a vote if progress stalls, and said another round of negotiations was unnecessary. ‘We know what we need to do to end plastic pollution simply adding more meetings is not the solution,’ said Eirik Lindebjerg, global plastics policy lead at WWF. While dozens of countries support production limits and phasing out some chemicals and unnecessary plastic products, left unclear is the position of the world’s top two plastics producers, China and the United States. Both were notably absent from the stage at a Sunday press conference by countries urging a strong treaty and were not on the list of countries supporting Rwanda’s statement.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/251762/divided-plastic-pollution-negotiators-call-for-more-time

Interplay of politics and minority issues,"BANGLADESH has long been celebrated for its rich tradition of communal coexistence, a tapestry woven from the diverse threads of its cultural and religious heritage. This vibrant legacy, however, is now under siege. In the aftermath of regime changes and political upheavals, we have witnessed a troubling rise in communal tensions that threaten to unravel the very fabric of society. As we delve into the heart of these incidents, it becomes clear that the roots of this unrest often lie not within the communities themselves but are instead fuelled by political machinations — both domestic and international. The Awami League, led by Sheikh Hasina, positioned itself as the protector of minorities, claiming to safeguard vulnerable communities from threats. Yet, as violence against religious minorities — especially Hindus — became more frequent under her rule, one must question the sincerity of this claim. Is it possible that the party that presents itself as a guardian is simultaneously complicit in fostering an environment ripe for communal strife? The answer may lie in the intersection of politics and communal identity, where opportunistic factions exploit societal divisions to consolidate their power. Communal harmony in Bangladesh faces unprecedented challenges intricately linked to both domestic politics and external influences, particularly from neighbouring India. The narratives propagated by Indian media often exacerbate these tensions, spreading misinformation and misinterpretations of actual incidents immediately following the fall of the pro-Indian government in Bangladesh. This raises a critical question: what role should India play as a democratic nation in supporting the democratic aspirations of its neighbours like Bangladesh? The implications stretch far beyond mere politics; they touch on issues of identity, sovereignty, and the stability of the entire region. Historically, India has intervened in Bangladeshi affairs under the pretext of protecting Hindu minorities. While this may stem from genuine concern for these communities, it also raises suspicions about India’s motives. Is this intervention truly about safeguarding minorities, or is it a strategic manoeuvre to maintain influence over Bangladesh? The Bharatiya Janata Party has adeptly utilised Hindu nationalism to galvanise support domestically, often at the expense of stability in neighbouring countries. This manipulation of communal identities for political gain poses significant risks not only to Bangladesh but also to regional harmony. As we contemplate the future, we must consider the broader implications of using communal interactions as political tools. If this trend continues unchecked, Bangladesh risks spiralling into a cycle of violence and instability that could undermine its democratic aspirations and threaten its hard-won independence. The sacrifices made during the Liberation War should not be overshadowed by divisive politics. How can Bangladesh cultivate a political culture that prioritises unity over division? What steps can be taken to ensure that communal harmony is not merely a slogan but a lived reality? In response to these challenges, it is essential for the people of Bangladesh to act with resolve. Citizens must present themselves as peace-loving individuals who reject extremism and violence. This requires collective action across all sectors of society: political leaders must engage in responsible governance that promotes inclusivity and accountability; civil society organisations need to advocate fiercely for minority rights; cultural leaders must foster dialogue that emphasises shared values rather than differences. The responsibility lies heavily on political actors within Bangladesh. They must resist the temptation to exploit communal tensions for electoral gain and instead focus on building a cohesive society where every citizen feels valued and protected. This includes ensuring accountability for acts of violence against minorities and promoting policies that safeguard all citizens regardless of their religious affiliations. How can leaders be held accountable when they fail to protect vulnerable communities? What frameworks can be established to ensure justice prevails? Moreover, for Bangladesh to maintain its sovereignty amidst external pressures, it must explore foreign policy options that prioritise national interests while fostering regional stability. Engaging with international partners to promote human rights and democratic governance could strengthen its position against external manipulations. What alliances should Bangladesh pursue to bolster its sovereignty? How can it leverage its geopolitical significance to advocate for a more stable regional environment? As Bangladesh stands at this critical juncture, the urgency for communal harmony has never been more pronounced. The interplay between politics and religion poses significant risks; however, with collective action and a commitment to justice, there is hope for a future where diversity is celebrated rather than exploited. The path forward requires not only introspection but also bold action from all sectors of society — politicians, civil society leaders, and ordinary citizens alike. In conclusion, can Bangladesh reclaim its narrative as a bastion of communal harmony? Will it rise above the divisive tactics employed by both internal and external actors? Only time will tell if this resilient nation can navigate these turbulent waters while upholding its foundational values of peace and coexistence. The story of Bangladesh is still being written; it is up to its people to ensure that it remains one of unity rather than division — a narrative filled with hope rather than despair.

"Challenges, progress, and the pursuit of lasting peace","THE Chittagong Hill Tracts Accord, popularly known as the ‘Peace Accord,’ was signed on December 2, 1997, between the government and the Parbatya Chattogram Jana Samhati Samiti. It has been widely discussed locally and internationally. The accord ended the 20-year-long, violent conflict and set the stage for inclusive, peaceful, and integrated coexistence between Bengalis and indigenous people. It promised to protect indigenous rights, promote infrastructure development, resolve land disputes, and improve local government for lasting peace in the region. However, the ineffective land commission, bureaucratic obstacles, the continued presence of some armed groups, and the unending delay in withdrawing the temporary army camps have hindered the process of implementation. The accord of 1997 has mainly helped to deescalate the long-standing ethnic armed conflict, providing a relatively stable environment for the inhabitants of the area. The accord has opened the path for several local developmental projects. Establishing schools, colleges, and training facilities in the educational field has raised the literacy rate and given indigenous children better access to education. The healthcare sector has also seen some rather essential changes. New roads, bridges, and power supply have improved the communication system. The accord created expectations that the political conflicts in the region will come to an end. However, a crisis of trust, a lack of political will in the implementation of the accord, has left the region unstable 27 years after the signing of the accord. Main clauses of the accord remain unenforced. For instance, the Land Commission’s activities have been constantly hampered, which is a significant impediment to the defence of indigenous people’s land rights. The failure to remove temporary army camps from the region has also contributed to growing frustrations among the indigenous communities. Although the treaty promised regional peace, the disagreement within the indigenous political leadership over the accord created new forms of political tensions. The Parbatya Chattogram Jana Samhati Samiti signed the treaty, but a section of indigenous communities opposed the treaty and considered it as acting against the interest of their people. This difference eventually led to the formation of a new political party, the United People’s Democratic Front, in 1998 and set the path for fresh strife. The split within the JSS and the rise of the UPDF was a new chapter of carnage and internal conflict in the mountainous region. In the subsequent years, many smaller groups are formed, making the region more politically unstable. Frequent conflicts and bloodshed between several JSS and UPDF factions cause uncertainty and anxiety in the indigenous lives. Apart from making the inhabitants insecure, these violent disputes also affect their social, cultural, and economic spheres. Furthermore, the growing complexity of the interaction between the indigenous and Bengali populations raises doubts about the aim of the agreement and the initiatives for peace establishment. In this context, the accord remains far from the desired success. The indigenous and Bengali residents of the CHT have long-standing mistrust and estrangement. Even with the accord, hegemonic attitudes and disrespect for indigenous culture and history have made the situation in the hills worse. The Indigenous people have been enraged and disappointed by the constant rejection of their social and cultural identity. Concurrently, many Bengalis’ predisposition to regard the CHT as a venue for realising their hegemony has hindered social peace. The indigenous people are thus struggling to protect their unique cultural traditions. An inclusive approach is necessary to close social and cultural gaps. Establishing peace mostly depends on an environment of intercultural communication and mutual respect between the indigenous and Bengali people. While the growth of the tourism industry has opened financial opportunities, it has also destroyed the natural and cultural legacy of the local people. Natural forests have been destroyed under the pretext of development, and traditional jum cultivation methods have become increasingly difficult. To make things worse, the cultivation of rubber and tobacco is encouraged and incentivised, which has compromised the scope of traditional modes of cultivation and resulted in environmental damage. The expansion in tourism has led to more land acquisition in many areas, dispossessing indigenous communities from their ancestral lands. Many times, projects involving the growth of tourism are planned and executed without any consultation with the local people. Establishing inclusive policies for the local population and ensuring the preservation of their livelihoods and surroundings could make a difference in this regard. How might the CHT come to embrace peace? Restoring peace can depend on three main elements: full implementation of the accord, confidence building, and inclusive development. Every clause of the agreement should be implemented judiciously. The land commission and land dispute resolution should be a policy priority. In addition, plans must be developed for the people who were forced to leave their ancestral land because of armed conflict and political instability in the region. Furthermore, it is crucial to ensure the regional councils and other administrative systems are effective so the inhabitants of CHT can properly obtain their rights and opportunities. Awareness campaigns and inter-community dialogue are crucial to building trust between Bengalis and indigenous people. Indigenous people should be actively involved in development planning and execution. The first focus should be on safeguarding the environment and the legacy of Indigenous people. To ensure the sustainability of development projects, it is crucial to consider the opinions of the indigenous people and arrange to safeguard their livelihoods. Properly implementing these steps will help bring harmony between indigenous people and Bengalis and peace in the CHT— a ‘tribal populated region,’ which is officially recognised in the accord. Though the accord ended the ‘counterinsurgency period’ and presented the possibility of a peaceful future, peace is still elusive because of its delayed implementation or non-implementation. Establishing peace requires both political will and inclusive development and a comprehensive strategy to foster mutual trust. Peace is the endeavour to create a safe, fair, and just society, not merely the absence of conflict. This helps one to realise that peaceful coexistence between indigenous peoples and Bengalis is not unattainable given mutual understanding and cooperation.

CHT Accord and a promise unfulfilled,"ON DECEMBER 2, 1997, the signing of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Accord marked a historic moment for Bangladesh, promising peace, development, and political autonomy to the region’s indigenous communities after decades of armed conflict. Yet, as we commemorate 27 years of this milestone, the stark reality is that the vision of the accord remains largely unfulfilled, leaving many of its promises unmet and its aspirations unrealised. After 27 years since its signing, many Indigenous people in CHT feel that the accord has not delivered on its promises, leading to continued frustration and calls for a reevaluation of its implementation. There is a growing call for more genuine implementation of the accord’s provisions and greater attention to the rights and needs of indigenous peoples. Meanwhile, the military’s strong presence in the region, justified as a means to maintain order, is viewed by many indigenous communities as oppressive and counterproductive to achieving lasting peace in the CHT.  Context of the Accord THE CHT region, home to diverse indigenous groups collectively known as the Jumma people, had long been a site of conflict due to historical neglect, marginalisation, and state policies of settlement and militarisation. The insurgency led by the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti and its armed wing, the Shanti Bahini, underscored the region’s demand for cultural, political, and territorial autonomy. The 1997 Accord aimed to address these grievances through provisions such as the establishment of a Regional Council, the rehabilitation of displaced people, the resolution of land disputes, and the withdrawal of military forces from the region. It was hailed internationally as a model of conflict resolution.  Unrealised promises MORE than a quarter-century later, progress on key provisions of the accord remains negligible: Land disputes: The accord promised the formation of a Land Commission to resolve land disputes involving indigenous peoples and settlers. However, the commission remains largely ineffective due to bureaucratic delays, lack of political will, and inadequate resources. Land grabbing continues, fuelling tension and resentment. Militarisation: One of the most significant promises was the withdrawal of temporary military camps. While some camps have been removed, the region remains heavily militarised in the name of security. This persistent presence undermines the sense of autonomy and trust among indigenous communities. Autonomy and governance: The Regional Council, meant to serve as a vehicle for self-governance, faces systemic challenges. Limited financial resources, interference from the central government, and overlapping administrative powers with other authorities hinder its effectiveness. Rights and representation: Indigenous peoples continue to face systemic discrimination, lack of political representation, and barriers to accessing education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. Their unique cultural identities and languages remain at risk. Rehabilitation of internally displaced people: Thousands of displaced families, both internally and in neighbouring India, have yet to be rehabilitated. Many live in precarious conditions without access to basic services.  Root causes of implementation failure The stagnation stems from several factors, including political apathy, conflict of interests, and bureaucratic inefficiency. Successive governments have shown little interest in fully implementing the accord, often viewing it as a low-priority issue. Settler communities, backed by influential actors, often resist measures favouring indigenous rights. Delays and mismanagement within government institutions have slowed down implementation efforts. There is no robust mechanism to hold stakeholders accountable for failing to honour the commitments of the accord.  Way forward TO HONOUR the spirit of the 1997 Accord, concerted efforts are required from all stakeholders. The government must prioritise the full implementation of the accord, demonstrating genuine political will and leadership. The Land Commission and the Regional Council must be empowered with adequate resources, authority, and autonomy. Phased withdrawal of military presence, coupled with enhanced civilian administration, can foster trust and reduce tensions in the region. Policies promoting the preservation of indigenous languages, traditions, and heritage are essential for ensuring cultural survival. Inclusive governance and active participation of indigenous communities in decision-making processes are critical for long-term peace. The Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord was a beacon of hope for a marginalised region, but its unrealised promises have left a deep sense of frustration and disillusionment. If Bangladesh is to uphold its values of inclusivity and justice, the accord must be revitalised as a living document of peace and progress. After 27 years, the time has come to translate words into action, ensuring that the vision of the accord is finally fulfilled.

Education for climate action,"CLIMATE change has evolved from a distant environmental concern to an urgent global crisis, affecting every aspect of human life. Its impact is evident in rising temperatures, extreme weather events, shifting ecosystems and social disruptions. In Bangladesh, one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations, the effects are acute: rising sea levels, frequent cyclones, flooding and unpredictable weather patterns threaten both lives and livelihoods. Against this backdrop, education becomes a vital tool for building climate resilience and fostering sustainable practices. By raising awareness, cultivating skills and inspiring action, education can equip individuals, communities and society towards sustainable behaviours and policies that mitigate climate change and promote adaptation to combat climate change effectively.  Raising awareness, climate knowledge EDUCATION lays the foundation for climate awareness. Integrating climate science into Bangladesh’s curriculum — from primary school to higher education — helps students understand the causes, consequences and complexities of climate change. This foundational knowledge is essential in a country where the links between human activity, carbon emissions, deforestation and environmental degradation are increasingly evident. By understanding these dynamics, students can relate climate change to local challenges, like river erosion and salinity intrusion, which affect Bangladesh’s communities directly. For example, if students learn how rising sea levels impact agriculture in coastal areas, they are more likely to support policies promoting flood-resistant crop varieties and sustainable farming methods. Climate education can thus build a generation of environmentally literate citizens who make informed, climate-friendly decisions.  Promoting sustainable practices from a young age TEACHING sustainable habits early on is crucial. Educating young people about energy conservation, waste reduction, responsible consumption and biodiversity preservation fosters lifelong environmental responsibility. Schools across Bangladesh can serve as models by implementing eco-friendly practices, such as waste management, water conservation and recycling programs. Experiential learning activities — like tree planting campaigns, school gardening, or coastal clean-ups — reinforce these values and demonstrate how individual and collective action can positively impact the environment. As children practice sustainability in schools, they are more likely to carry these habits into adulthood and advocate for similar practices in their families, communities and workplaces.  Cultivating critical thinking and problem-solving skills ADDRESSING climate change demands critical thinking and innovative solutions. By developing problem-solving skills, education prepares students to tackle complex issues. For example, science classes in Bangladesh can teach students to analyse weather data and climate patterns, while social studies can explore how these changes impact communities socially and economically. Critical thinking skills enable students to sift through climate information, distinguish credible sources and understand the nuances of scientific data and policy discussions. In a region often affected by climate misinformation, an educated population that can critically assess information is essential for maintaining public support for climate action.  Empowering the youth to lead and advocate BANGLADESHI youth play an increasingly active role in climate advocacy. Education can empower young people with the knowledge and confidence they need to lead climate initiatives. Youth-led movements, such as environmental clubs and community campaigns, have already emerged in Bangladesh, showing the potential for young voices to influence local and national policy discussions. Educational institutions can support this trend by offering leadership training, establishing environmental clubs and fostering partnerships with NGOs. By involving students in climate policy projects and awareness campaigns, schools help build the next generation of climate leaders ready to advocate for sustainable change in their communities and beyond. Enhancing climate resilience and adaptation skills FOR Bangladesh, climate resilience and adaptation skills are crucial. Education that incorporates resilience training can help individuals and communities respond proactively to climate-related challenges. For instance, farmers can learn about climate-resilient crops, coastal communities can be trained in flood management and families can practice disaster preparedness. Local educational programs can offer practical training on sustainable water management, soil conservation and flood-resistant agriculture. By emphasising community-specific adaptation strategies, educational initiatives can ensure that individuals are well-prepared to face the challenges of extreme weather, making climate resilience part of everyday life.  Steering careers towards environmental fields EDUCATION can guide students toward careers that support climate action, such as renewable energy, environmental policy and sustainable agriculture. In our country, higher education institutions can promote programs that develop expertise in these fields. Degrees in environmental science, renewable energy and sustainable business management can lead to careers that directly address climate challenges. Internships, partnerships with environmental organisations and hands-on training can expose students to real-world climate issues, nurturing a skilled workforce ready to implement sustainable practices across sectors. As the demand for green jobs grows, education can bridge the gap, preparing Bangladesh’s youth for roles essential in the fight against climate change.  Encouraging global citizenship and responsibility EDUCATION fosters a sense of global citizenship and collective responsibility. Climate change is a global issue, yet Bangladesh bears a disproportionate impact, despite contributing minimally to global emissions. Teaching students about the international dimensions of climate change helps them understand the importance of climate justice and the need for collective action. Our students who learn about global climate agreements, like the Paris Agreement, gain a sense of empathy and solidarity with other vulnerable communities. This awareness motivates individuals to support policies and practices that prioritise climate justice, recognising that Bangladesh’s fight against climate change is also a call for global accountability.  Supporting policy change and community action EDUCATED individuals are more likely to engage in policy change efforts and community action, advocating for climate-friendly policies and supporting sustainable practices at the local level. Climate literacy programs in Bangladesh — whether through schools, workshops, or community centres — can empower individuals to push for policies that prioritise renewable energy, conservation and environmental protection. Engaging with local government, youth advocates and community leaders can amplify these efforts, ensuring that climate actions align with the specific needs of communities across the country. Education in this way builds a foundation for sustained, localised climate action that can influence broader policy goals.  Education as the path to climate resilience EDUCATION is not only a way to understand climate change but also a powerful tool to drive meaningful action. By raising awareness, promoting sustainable practices and empowering youth, education provides the knowledge, skills and values needed for climate resilience. In a country like Bangladesh, where climate impacts are urgent and widespread, integrating climate education across schools, universities and communities can nurture a generation equipped to face climate challenges head-on. Through a holistic, interdisciplinary approach, climate education can inspire real change, transforming awareness into measurable action. By fostering a commitment to environmental stewardship, education has the power to safeguard Bangladesh’s future and contribute to a more sustainable, resilient world for all.

Govt should double efforts for laundered money recovery,"AN INVESTIGATIVE report by a British news agency once again shows that politicians and businesspeople linked to the deposed Awami League have laundered huge wealth off Bangladesh. The report, conducted by the Observer in collaboration with Transparency International that British newspaper Guardian published on November 30, shows that prominent Bangladeshi politicians and businesspeople own top-flight properties worth an estimated £400 million in the United Kingdom. The properties were acquired through offshore companies and members of the family, with ownership concealed using complex corporate structures. The report mentions the names of a few and members of the families that own the property. Among them are Salman F Rahman, who was private industry investment adviser to the prime minister, former land minister Saifuzzaman Chowdhury, businesspeople Ahmed Akber Sobhan, Nazrul Mazumder and members of their family. Members of the Rahman family own, or hold stakes in, seven luxury blocks of flats there while the family of Ahmed Akber Sobhan of the Bashundhara Group own three properties in the United Kingdom. The family of Nazrul Mazumder, founder and chair of the Nassa Group, own top-flight Kensington property. Former land minister Saifuzzaman Chowdhury and his family own or have stakes in more than 300 UK properties worth at least £160 million. The report is understandably not an exhaustive one as many others are likely to own and have stakes in property in the United Kingdom while the people mentioned in the report may also have more wealth there than what was reported as ownership can be easily hidden by wrapping the property-owning company inside another offshore vehicle such as an anonymous trust. The accumulation of illegal wealth by politicians and businesspeople overseas, especially in the United Kingdom, has been reported earlier too by local and international media. A white paper published on December 1 on the state of the economy during the Awami League regime says that on an average, $16 billion were illicitly syphoned off Bangladesh every year during Sheikh Hasina’s ‘corrupt autocracy’, leaving the country in a ‘state of plunder’. The massive pilfering was only possible because relevant state institutions under the Awami League regime remained virtually ineffective or complicit. A culture of impunity and lack of accountability let corrupt elements get away by amassing illegal wealth. This is assuring that the government now considers repatriating stolen funds as its priority area of intervention, but it should quickly develop a strategy to fulfil its mandate, which is to locate the laundered money, initiate transnational legal processes and set up communications with countries where the money was transferred. Illicit capital flow is a major reason for the ongoing economic crisis, especially the dollar shortage. The interim government should, therefore, scale up its efforts to recover the laundered money and hold the launderers to justice. The government should also deliver on its anti-money laundering pledges and put in place a mechanism to stop the recurrence of capital flight.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/251725/govt-should-double-efforts-for-laundered-money-recovery
Uprising criminal cases should have sound legal footing,"THE wholesale filing of cases in connection with murder of and attacks on protesters that took place in July–August and flaws in the filing of the cases stand to harm justice and allow perpetrators to escape unpunished. The police say that more than 2,500 cases have been filed until mid-November in connection with the murders and attacks during the uprising, noting that about 8,000 people have also been arrested in the cases until October. And, progress in the investigation of the cases but for the ones filed with the International Crimes Tribunal has been slow over three months and a half. In many cases, as New Age reported on December 1, the people who have already died or are living overseas have been named accused. Cases have also been filed in connection with the ‘claimed’ death of the people who are still alive. Whilst there are such consistencies in many cases, as law enforcement officials dealing with the cases say, in some cases, the complainants say that they do not know the people named accused in the cases. There have also been cases where students and politically-oriented people have prepared the complaints, filed with the police with the signature of the complainants. Whilst this suggests that the reality on the ground may not only hinder justice and allow offenders to escape unpunished, the slow progress in the investigation of most of the cases may also harm justice dispensation. Such a situation would also be reflective of the proverbial case of ‘justice delayed, justice denied’, for both the people who have wronged and the people who have been wronged against. Individuals and private parties, meanwhile, keep filing vexatious cases and the police processing arrests and courts rejecting prayers for bail and remanding the accused in custody. It appears that the legacy of misrule, as it happened in the past, keeps repeating itself. Experts hold brief for a high-level committee to oversee the process of justice and accountability in the cases filed in connection with the murder and attacks that took place during the uprising. Such a committee should help to curb the wholesale filing of cases, ensure investigation by an independent and high-level team, screen out vexatious cases and establish a policy and priorities for prosecution. The government should have done this or something similar to this earlier to ensure an effective justice dispensation. The home affairs adviser to the interim government says that the government has formed a committee to stop people from being harassed in vexatious cases, noting that legal steps are under way that no false or vexatious cases are filed. But the measures appear a bit delayed, enough to cause confusion and distrust. The government should not hurry investigations and legal proceedings so as to avoid any miscarriage of justice, but it should not also allow the flurry of apparently vexatious cases, seemingly with no legal merits, to frustrate its effort for justice delivery in connection with murders of and attacks on protesters that took place during the July–August uprising.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/251724/uprising-criminal-cases-should-have-sound-legal-footing
