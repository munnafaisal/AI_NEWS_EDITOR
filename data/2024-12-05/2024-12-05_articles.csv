UN urges Afghan Taliban not to block women’s medical training,"The UN mission to Afghanistan on Wednesday urged the Taliban government to reconsider a reported plan to ban women from attending medical training institutes, in the latest move to restrict women’s education. A health ministry source and managers from private medical institutes, which offer training in subjects such as midwifery and nursing, said on Tuesday the public health ministry had issued a directive from the Taliban supreme leader to suspend women’s attendance. There has been no official Taliban government confirmation of the ban, but institute employees said they had been given 10 days to hold final exams before women would be barred. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said it was ‘extremely concerned’ by the reports and urged the Taliban government to ‘reconsider implementing’ the rule. Meanwhile, an Afghan TV station has been shut down after its office was used for dubbing ‘vulgar’ programmes for banned media, the Taliban morality ministry said on Thursday, with the channel’s employees saying six people have been detained. The ministry for the propagation of virtue and prevention of vice accused people working within Arezo TV of providing content to Afghan media based outside the country, which have been heavily restricted and criticised by the Taliban authorities. ‘Some people were using the name of Arezo TV to carry out actions that were contrary to Islamic values and national traditions,’ the PVPV said in a statement announcing the station’s closure. ‘It became clear that some people had used the name and building of Arezo TV as well as their position in the media outlet to pay temporary workers to dub vulgar serials and programmes that were against Islamic and Afghan principles and traditions with the financial support of exiled media outlets outside the country,’ it said. Two employees with Arezo said that six people were arrested when the office was raided. Around eight Taliban officials — including one who was armed — entered the Kabul office mid-morning on Wednesday and separated men from women before taking their phones and information, one source said. ‘The office is sealed, and they asked us to wait for further orders — either the office will be reopened again or shut down,’ he said. A second Arezo TV employee said the six detained employees were still in custody and under investigation by PVPV. As of Thursday afternoon, Arezo TV was not broadcasting in Kabul, AFP journalists said. The Afghanistan Journalists Centre, a press freedom group, said Taliban intelligence officers and morality police had raided the office, citing an employee saying the staff were ‘mistreated’ and that their phones and computers were confiscated. The channel, founded in 2006 in northern Mazar-i-Sharif city, produces news as well as wildlife documentaries and ‘Islamic series’ dubbed from Turkish, with a staff of some 70 people in Kabul, AFJC said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/252115/un-urges-afghan-taliban-not-to-block-womens-medical-training
BNP submits recommendations to police reform commission,"BNP on Thursday submitted its recommendations to the police administration reform commission.

Peacekeeping force should be sent to India: Jahangir,"Home adviser lieutenant general (retired) Jahangir Alam Chowdhury on Thursday suggested that peacekeeping forces be sent to India instead of Bangladesh. He was talking to journalists after the inauguration of International Volunteer Day 2024 at the fire service and civil defence multipurpose training ground in Purbachal, Narayanganj. The remarks came after journalists drew his attention to a recent statement by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee that United Nations peacekeeping forces be sent to Bangladesh. Mamata’s statement came amid tension between Dhaka and New Delhi on the issue of minority situation in Bangladesh. Responding to questions regarding this, the home adviser said that peacekeeping forces should be sent to India, not to Bangladesh. He also highlighted that the recent call for national unity in Bangladesh had received a positive response, which he believed would help counter conspiracies and maintain order in the country. The adviser dismissed concerns about tensions at the border, saying, ‘There is no tension along the border. However, the propaganda India is spreading about Bangladesh will be collectively addressed by everyone.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252113/peacekeeping-force-should-be-sent-to-india-jahangir
Protests against mission attack continue,"Protests over the attack on the Bangladesh assistant high commission in India’s Agartala rolled into the fourth consecutive day on Thursday in Dhaka city and some other places in the country. Different political parties and cultural bodies staged protests on the day demanding a ban on the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, ISKCON, the boycott of Indian products and others. Amid the growing tension over the two neighboring countries, Border Guard Bangladesh has declared a high alert at several points along the Benapole border, including Dhannokhola, Raghunathpur, Sadipur, Ghiba, Putkhali, Bahadurpur,  Doulatpur, Boro Achra, and Gatipara, to counter any potential threat. Bangladesh mission in Agartala came under attack by a group of Indians on Monday afternoon during their protests demanding the release of Hindu community leader in Bangladesh Chinmoy Krishna Das, now in jail in a sedition case. Bangladesh Nationalist Party senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvy slammed the attack and desecration of the Bangladesh national flag. He was addressing a rally organised under the banner of Deshi Ponno Kine Hou Dhonno in front of the National Press Club. ‘We will boycott their [Indian] products as those people don’t respect our independence and tore our national flag at Agartala,’ said Rizvy, claiming that Bangladesh was not dependent on India. He said that people of Bangladesh would not disrespect Indian flag and its dignity and sovereignty although Indian people disrespected Bangladesh’s national flag. Rizvy called upon the people to remain united to prevent Indian aggression in Bangladesh. Bangladesh Supreme Party organised a rally and procession in front of the Press Club protesting at the attack on Bangladesh mission, desecration of the national flag and spreading propaganda. BSP secretary general Abdul Aziz Sarkar warned the Narendra Modi-led government to stay away from Bangladesh aggression. Aziz said that Bangladeshi people did not like extremism as the people from all religions, including Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians have been living with strong unity and harmony for years. He said that although India had supported Bangladesh during the country’s War of Independence, Bangladeshi people would not allow India to carry out any aggression in the country. BSP also held procession along the nearby roads of Paltan and Segunbagicha areas. Jatiya Kabita Parishad also held a protest rally in front of the National Press Club condemning the attack on Bangladesh mission in Agartala. The attack on Bangladesh mission in Agartala is a violation of international treaty, the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, of 1961 and an attack on sovereignty of Bangladesh as well, speakers said. Jatiya Kabita Parishad convener poet Mohon Raihan said that the attack on Bangladesh mission and desecration of the national flag was a provocation of Modi-led government. The Parishad member secretary Rezauddin Stalin said that Bangladeshi people would fight for the country’s sovereignty. New Age correspondent in Feni reported that National Ulama Mashaikh Aimma Parishad held a mass rally and brought out a protest procession at Parshuram upazila in the district protesting at the attack on Bangladesh mission in Agartala in the afternoon. The protesters also demanded a ban on ISKCON and ensure trial into the lawyer Saiful Islam Alif’s murder. Different volunteer groups and other people brought out a torch procession and held a protest rally over abusive comment on Bangladeshi people at Bilonia of Feni along Indian border. The rally was held at the Central Shaheed Minar in Feni town and brought out a torch procession and marched several areas in the town.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/252112/protests-against-mission-attack-continue
Lack of awareness to cost farmers this season,"Rajshahi farmers are set to face financial losses this year as they are applying three times more fertiliser than what is required due to lack of government initiatives to make people aware of the proper application of fertilisers. The agricultural officers say that they have been holding group and yard meetings with farmers and have been conducting campaigns to make farmers aware so that the latter do not apply fertiliser in excess of permitted levels. Farmers, however, said that the government’s initiatives to make them aware of the proper application of fertiliser and pesticides to their lands were inadequate as most of them had not been informed about it. ‘We do not actually know when and how much fertiliser we need to apply to our farmland,’ said Habibur Rahman, a farmer from Tanore upazila in Rajshahi. He said that they were applying two sacks (100 kilogrammes) of muriate of potash, generally known as MOP, one sack (50 kg) of di-ammonium phosphate, generally known as DAP, and one sack of triple superphosphate, generally known as TSP, to per bigha of land before planting potato seeds. ‘We will also add a little quantity of fertiliser again when the potato leaves will grow,’ he added. Another farmer Mostakin Islam of the same upazila told New Age that they were applying two sacks of MOP, one and a half sacks of DAP, and a half sack of TSP to per bigha of land before planting potato seeds. Asked about whether anyone from the agricultural department contacted or instructed them about how much fertiliser they needed to apply to their land for potato cultivation, he answered negatively. Khorshed Alam, a farmer of Baghmara upazila in Rajshahi, told New Age that farmers in their area were in competition over applying fertilisers to their potato fields with the intention of getting more yield. The agricultural officials, however, said that recommended amounts of MOP, TSP or DAP were 24 kg and 20 kg respectively for per bigha of land. In the 2024-25 season, the agricultural officials have set a target of producing about 98.55 lakh tonnes of potato from 3.65 lakh hectres of land in sixteen districts of Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions. ‘If a farmer applies TSP to their potato fields, then they do not need to apply DAP as it is genetically phosphate,’ said Rajshahi DAE office sub-assistant agriculture officer. Kawser Ali, a professor of crop science and technology at Rajshahi University, however, told New Age that about 20 to 25 kg of MOP and TSP or DAP each was enough to apply for cultivating potato per bigha of land. Rajshahi DAE deputy director Mst Umme Salma said, ‘We are conducting campaigns to ensure that fertilisers are not being applied to the land in excess of the permitted levels.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252111/lack-of-awareness-to-cost-farmers-this-season
Atikur Rahman’s 1st death anniv observed,"Politicians, academics and professionals at a commemorative meeting in Dhaka on Thursday said that people should follow the ideals of the late Atiqur Rahman Salu for getting justified water sharing of the common revers from India. International Farakka Committee organised the commemoration meeting to mark the first anniversary of death of former International Farakka Committee chairman Atiqur Rahman Salu, who died in the United States on December 5, at the National Press Club. Bangladesh Nationalist Party standing committee member Abdul Mayeen Khan said that Atiqur Rahman Salu was a true follower of Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani who formed the IFC for getting justified water sharing of the common revers between Bangladesh and India. He proposed that we could hold another long march towards Indian border to press demand of justified water sharing from India like the long march held by Maulana Bhashani in 1974. Chaired by chairman of the IFC Tipu Sultan, Jatiya Party faction chairman Mostafa Jamal Haider, the IFC Bangladesh chapter chairman Jasim Uddin Ahmed, politicians Saiful Huq, Zahir Uddin Swapan, Bangladesh coordinator of the IFC Mostafa Kamal Majumder, among others, spoke at the meeting.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252110/atikur-rahmans-1st-death-anniv-observed

Tk 5 lakh reward for Jr hockey team,"The Bangladesh Hockey Federation on Thursday awarded Tk five lakh to the Bangladesh Under-21 hockey team in recognition of their achievement of qualifying for next year’s FIH Men’s Junior World Cup at a reception ceremony upon their return from Oman on Thursday morning. Bangladesh finished fifth in the Men’s Junior Asia Cup 2024 in Muscat, with three victories, two draws, and one loss, paving the path for their first Junior World Cup appearance. BHF president Air Chief Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan welcomed the team members with garlands before handing over the cheque to the team, comprised of 18 players and three officials, at the BAF Falcon Hall in the city. ‘Our financial condition is not in ideal shape, so we could only allocate Tk five lakh as a reward for the team,’ said Mahmood during the reception ceremony. Mahmood promised further support to the team that accomplished what no other Bangladesh hockey team had ever done before. ‘This is a significant accomplishment. By qualifying for the Junior World Cup, you have created an opportunity to aim for the Senior World Cup in the future. We will provide our best efforts, irrespective of challenges, as you will face bigger hurdles in the coming days,’ said Mahmood. Earlier, Bangladesh confirmed their place in the Junior World Cup with a 7-2 win over Thailand in a place-deciding (fifth-eighth) match on December 3, a day before they defeated China 6-3 in the fifth-placed decider of the 10-team tournament.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/hockey/252107/tk-5-lakh-reward-for-jr-hockey-team
Mixed year for Tigers in WTC,"As the battle for the final of the ICC World Test Championship is heating up with the ongoing series between Australia and India, Sri Lanka and South Africa, and England and New Zealand, Bangladesh confirmed their highest-ever finish on the table after registering a memorable win against the West Indies in the recently concluded second Test at Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica. The Tigers ended the two-match series 1-1 after they beat the hosts by 101 runs on Tuesday after losing the first one in Antigua. This was the last series for Bangladesh in this cycle. With a point percentage of 31.25, Bangladesh are now in eighth position, only above the Caribbean side in the nine-team competition. Bangladesh can even finish in seventh if Pakistan fail to win a single match against South Africa in their forthcoming series. In the previous two cycles of the WTC, Bangladesh finished at the bottom with one and zero wins, respectively. This time Bangladesh won four matches—two against Pakistan and one each against New Zealand and the West Indies. Three of those four wins came away from home, and that makes 2024 Bangladesh’s most successful calendar year in terms of away wins. Two of those came against Pakistan when Bangladesh cleanswept them. But this cycle will remain as one where Bangladesh suffered some crushing defeats. On top of that list would be the second Test against India in Kanpur when the Tigers lost in a little over five sessions. Bangladesh began the new cycle with a historic win over New Zealand in Sylhet in December last year. They also missed a golden opportunity in the second Test when the Kiwis were 69-6 at one stage in the fourth innings chasing 137. Bangladesh failed to win a single of the four matches that they played against Sri Lanka and South Africa at home. The Tigers had only themselves to blame for their series loss against the Proteas, as South Africa had been on a 10-year losing streak in the sub-continent with nine straight losses. The South African team that visited Bangladesh was also a weakened one this time, but the batters failed miserably for Bangladesh, as it has been the case for them in this cycle of WTC. The lack of big innings and partnerships from up in the order cost Bangladesh badly. There were only four hundreds for Bangladesh batters in 12 matches, whereas only five partnerships reached the 100-mark. Those were also mostly from below the order—three at the seventh wicket and one each at the sixth and ninth wickets. Shadman Islam has been the most consistent opener among the three who batted in the position but didn’t have any hundred. The dip in form of captain Najmul Hossain Shanto didn’t help either. He had an excellent 2023 with an average of 55, but this time around he only managed to average 21.13. Shanto even wanted to quit the captaincy, and that created a strong murmur during the South Africa series. But the bowling has been the biggest positive point for Bangladesh with a stable pace attack. The emergence of pace sensation Nahid Rana set a different vibe, and with Shakib Al Hasan’s career all but over, Taijul Islam started to take more responsibility in the spin attack.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252106/mixed-year-for-tigers-in-wtc
India launches European ‘artifical eclipse’ satellites,"India on Thursday successfully launched into space a pair of European satellites that will create artificial solar eclipses to help scientists catch a rare glimpse of the Sun’s mysterious atmosphere. Scientists broke into rapturous applause at the Sriharikota launch site as the Indian Space Research Organisation chief announced the spacecraft had been ejected as planned. ‘The spacecraft has been placed in the right orbit,’ ISRO chief S Somanath said. The launch, originally scheduled for Wednesday but delayed by a technical fault, was for the European Space Agency’s ‘Project for On-Board Autonomy 3’ (Proba-3) mission, part of a series of ‘in-orbit missions to test out new technologies’. The mission, at a cost of 200 million euros ($211 million), creates artificial total solar eclipses by positioning two satellites 150 metres apart from each other. The shadow cast by one satellite allows the other to observe solar phenomena while blocking out the light from the Sun itself. ‘For six hours at a time, it will be able to see the Sun’s faint atmosphere, the corona, in the hard-to-observe region between the Sun’s edge and 1.4 million kilometres from its surface,’ the European Space Agency said in a pre-launch analysis. The project will help scientists answer key questions, including why the corona is so much hotter than the Sun itself, and how the Sun’s energy output changes over time. India has emerged as a reliable and low-cost option for putting commercial spacecraft and the satellites of other countries into space. Experts say New Delhi can keep costs low by copying and adapting existing technology, and thanks to an abundance of highly skilled engineers who earn a fraction of their foreign counterparts’ wages. The world’s most populous country has flexed its spacefaring ambitions in the last decade with its space programme growing considerably in size and momentum, matching the achievements of established powers at a much cheaper price tag. In August 2023, it became just the fourth nation to land an unmanned craft on the Moon after Russia, the United States and China. Prime minister Narendra Modi also announced plans last year to send a man to the Moon by 2040.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/252105/india-launches-european-artifical-eclipse-satellites
"North Korea, Russia defence treaty comes into force","A landmark defence pact between North Korea and Russia, signed by its leaders in June, has gone into effect after the two sides exchanged ratification documents, North Korea’s official KCNA news agency said Thursday. The formalisation of the treaty comes as the United States and South Korea have accused the nuclear-armed North of sending more than 10,000 soldiers to help Russia fight Ukraine. Experts say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is keen to acquire advanced technology from Moscow and battle experience for his troops in return. Kim and Russian president Vladimir Putin signed the strategic partnership deal during the Kremlin chief’s visit to Pyongyang. It obligates both states to provide military assistance ‘without delay’ in the case of an attack on the other, and to jointly oppose Western sanctions. It came into effect from Wednesday, when the ratification documents were exchanged in Moscow by the countries’ vice foreign ministers Kim Jong Gyu and Andrei Rudenko, KCNA reported. Lawmakers in Moscow last month voted unanimously for the deal and it was later signed by Putin. Pyongyang said it was ratified by a decree from Kim. The treaty will serve ‘as a strong driving force accelerating the establishment of an independent and just multi-polarised world order without domination, subjugation and hegemony,’ KCNA said. Analysts have suggested Pyongyang could be using Ukraine as a means of realigning its foreign policy. By sending soldiers, North Korea is positioning itself within the Russian war economy as a supplier of weapons, military support and labour — potentially even bypassing traditional ally, neighbour and main trading partner China, they say. North Korea and Russia have strengthened their military ties since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Both countries are under rafts of UN sanctions — the former for its nuclear weapons programme and the latter for the Ukraine conflict. Kim said last week during a visit to Pyongyang by Russian defence minister Andrei Belousov that his government, army and people would ‘invariably support the policy of the Russian Federation to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity’. Putin hailed the deal in June as a ‘breakthrough document’.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/252104/north-korea-russia-defence-treaty-comes-into-force
Israel accused of genocide in Gaza,"Amnesty International on Thursday accused Israel of ‘committing genocide’ against Palestinians in Gaza since the start of the war last year, saying its new report was a ‘wake-up call’ for the international community. The London-based rights organisation said its findings were based on ‘dehumanising and genocidal statements by Israeli government and military officials’, satellite images documenting devastation, fieldwork and ground reports from Gazans. ‘Month after month, Israel has treated Palestinians in Gaza as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them,’ Amnesty chief Agnes Callamard said in a statement. ‘Our damning findings must serve as a wake-up call to the international community: this is genocide. It must stop now,’ she added. The Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack inside southern Israel on October 7, 2023, triggering a deadly Israeli military offensive on Gaza as Israeli officials vowed to crush the militant group. A total of 1,208 people in southern Israel, mostly civilians, were killed during the Hamas attack, according to an AFP tally based on official data. Since then at least 44,532 people have been killed in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, deemed reliable by the UN. ‘There is absolutely no doubt that Israel has military objectives. But the existence of military objectives does not negate the possibility of a genocidal intent,’ Callamard said at a press conference in The Hague. She said the organisation had based its findings on the criteria set out in the UN Convention on the Prevention of Genocide. Israel has repeatedly and forcefully denied allegations of genocide, accusing Hamas of using civilians as human shields. But Amnesty’s 300-page report points to ‘direct deliberate attacks on civilian and civilian infrastructures where there was no Hamas presence or any other military objectives, the use of heavy explosive weapons with a wide radius of destruction in densely populated residential areas,’ the blocking of aid deliveries, and the displacement of 90 per cent of Gaza’s 2.4 million people. In the days after the October 7 attack, Israel imposed a ‘total siege’ on Gaza, with the slogan: ‘No electricity, no water, no gas’. Limited supplies have been allowed in since then. Palestinians have been subjected to ‘malnutrition, hunger and diseases’ and exposed to a ‘slow, calculated death’, Amnesty said. The rights group, which is also due to publish a report on the crimes committed by Hamas, cited 15 air strikes in Gaza between October 7, 2023 and April 20, which killed 334 civilians, including 141 children, for which the group found ‘no evidence that any of these strikes were directed at a military objective’. The Amnesty report also referenced dozens of calls by Israeli officials and soldiers for the annihilation, destruction, burning or ‘erasure’ of Gaza. Such statements highlighted ‘not only systemic impunity but also the creation of an environment that emboldens such behaviour.’ ‘Governments must stop pretending that they are powerless to terminate Israel’s occupation, to end apartheid and to stop the genocide in Gaza,’ said Callamard. ‘States that transfer arms to Israel violate their obligations to prevent genocide under the convention and are at risk of becoming complicit,’ she added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252103/israel-accused-of-genocide-in-gaza
South Korean president clings to power after martial law U-turn,"South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol was still clinging to power Thursday, with his party announcing they will oppose an impeachment motion after his short-lived imposition of martial law stunned the world. Yoon suspended civilian rule late Tuesday and deployed troops and helicopters to parliament only for lawmakers to vote down the measure and force him into a U-turn in a night of protests and drama. Seoul’s allies were alarmed — Washington said it found out via television — and the opposition quickly filed an impeachment motion saying Yoon ‘gravely violated the constitution and the law’. A vote is set for Saturday at around 7:00pm (1000 GMT). South Korean police also announced Thursday they were investigating Yoon for ‘insurrection’ — a crime that transcends presidential immunity and can carry the death penalty — after the opposition filed a complaint against him and other key figures involved. The opposition holds a large majority in the 300-member legislature and require only a handful of defections from Yoon’s People Power Party to secure the two-thirds majority needed for impeachment. But on Thursday, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon said that while he had demanded Yoon leave the party over his ‘unconstitutional martial law’, he would block the impeachment motion. ‘All 108 lawmakers of the People Power Party will stay united to reject the president’s impeachment,’ party floor leader Choo Kyung-ho said. According to a new poll issued Thursday by Realmeter, 73.6 per cent of respondents supported the impeachment. More protests were expected later Thursday. If the motion passes, Yoon will be suspended pending a verdict by the Constitutional Court. If the judges give the nod, Yoon will be impeached and new elections must take place within 60 days. Yoon, who has lurched from crisis to crisis since taking office in 2022, has not been seen in public since his televised address in the early hours of Wednesday. Local media quoted his office as saying he would not make any statement on Thursday. On Thursday, his office said that defence minister Kim Yong-hyun had resigned, but other key allies including interior minister Lee Sang-min remain in office. Prosecutors have also banned Kim from leaving the country, Yonhap news agency reported. Lawmakers, meanwhile, were grilling senior figures, including army chief of staff General Park An-su, who acted as Yoon’s martial law commander. Park said Thursday that he was kept in the dark until after the president had announced the imposition of martial law on live television late Tuesday. It was the first such declaration in more than four decades in South Korea and brought back painful memories of its autocratic past. The move was to ‘safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea’s communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people’s freedom and happiness,’ Yoon said. A six-point decree from the army chief banned political activities and parties, ‘false propaganda’, strikes and ‘gatherings that incite social unrest’. Security forces sealed the National Assembly, helicopters landed on the roof and almost 300 soldiers tried to lock down the building, seemingly to prevent lawmakers from entering. But as parliamentary staffers blocked the soldiers with sofas and fire extinguishers, enough MPs — some leaping over barriers — got inside and voted down Yoon’s move. This brought cheers from the hundreds of protesters braving bitter temperatures outside, many waving national flags and chanting for Yoon to be arrested. Lawmakers formally presented the impeachment motion in the early hours of Thursday, saying Yoon’s decision to impose martial law was intended to ‘evade imminent investigations... into alleged illegal acts involving himself and his family’. ‘This is an unforgivable crime — one that cannot, should not, and will not be pardoned,’ MP Kim Seung-won said. In a show of public anger, thousands of protesters converged around Yoon’s office in Seoul late Wednesday after staging a rally in Gwanghwamun Square, demanding his resignation. The United States has around 30,000 troops stationed in South Korea to help protect its ally against the nuclear-armed North. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Wednesday that Yoon’s imposition of martial law had ‘raised deep concern for us’ while praising the National Assembly for operating ‘according to constitutional processes and procedures’ to rescind it. China, a key ally of nuclear-armed North Korea, urged its citizens to exercise caution, while Russia — increasingly close to Pyongyang — called the situation ‘alarming’. In Japan, whose historically prickly relations with Seoul have thawed under Yoon, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba discussed the situation with key ministers and the national security advisor, Tokyo said Thursday. ‘Japan and South Korea are important neighbours that should tackle, as partners, various issues facing the international community,’ government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/252102/south-korean-president-clings-to-power-after-martial-law-u-turn

Rebels capture key Syrian city of Hama,"Islamist-led rebel forces captured the central Syrian city of Hama on Thursday, overrunning forces loyal to president Bashar al-Assad only days after capturing Aleppo in a lightning offensive. The rebels led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham stormed the city and, after fierce fighting, claimed to have seized its prison and released inmates. After a night of violent clashes, the rebels entered Hama ‘from several sides’ and were engaged in street fighting with Assad’s forces, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor. By early Thursday afternoon, Syria’s army admitted it had lost control of the strategically located city seen as crucial in its efforts to protect the capital and seat of power, Damascus. ‘Over the past few hours, with the intensification of confrontations between our soldiers and terrorist groups these groups were able to breach a number of axes in the city and entered it,’ the army said, adding units had redeployed outside the city. The fall of Hama came despite shelling and strikes carried out by the Syrian and Russian air forces, as reported by state media late Wednesday. Maya, a 22-year-old student who gave only her first name for security concerns, said she and her family were staying at home as the fighting rages outside. ‘We have been hearing non-stop the sounds of explosions and shelling,’ she said by telephone from Hama. ‘We don’t know what’s going on outside.’ The Observatory, which relies on a network of sources in Syria, says 727 people, mostly combatants but also 111 civilians, have been killed in Syria since the violence erupted last week. It marks the most intense fighting since 2020 in a country already ravaged by civil war, which erupted with the repression of pro-democracy protests in 2011. Key to the rebels’ successes since the start of the offensive last week was the takeover of Aleppo, which in more than a decade of war had never entirely fallen out of government hands. The head of HTS, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, on Wednesday visited Aleppo’s landmark citadel. Jolani was seen waving to supporters from an open-top car as he visited the historic fortress, in images posted on the rebels’ Telegram channel. While the advancing rebels found little resistance earlier in their offensive, the fighting around Hama has been especially fierce. Assad ordered a 50-percent raise in career soldiers’ pay, state news agency SANA reported, as he seeks to bolster his forces for the counteroffensive. Syrian armed forces were driven back by the rebels despite the government sending in ‘large military convoys’, according to the Observatory. The monitor said the fighting on Wednesday was close to an area mainly populated by Alawites, followers of the same offshoot of Shiite Islam as the president. The rebels launched their offensive in northern Syria on November 27, the same day a ceasefire took effect in the war between Israel and Hezbollah in neighbouring Lebanon. Both Hezbollah and Russia have been key backers of Assad’s government, but have been more recently mired in their own respective conflicts. The United Nations on Wednesday said 115,000 people had been ‘newly displaced across Idlib and northern Aleppo’ by the fighting. Human Rights Watch warned the fighting ‘raises concerns that civilians face a real risk of serious abuses at the hands of opposition armed groups and the Syrian government’. Until last week, the war in Syria had been mostly dormant for years, but analysts have said violence was bound to flare up as it was never truly resolved. Spearheading the rebel alliance is HTS, which is rooted in Syria’s al-Qaeda branch. ‘HTS has had a lot of time and space and resources to organise itself and to prepare for this,’ said analyst Sam Heller, of the US-based Century Foundation think tank. How the fighting unfolds now ‘depends on whether the Syrian government can regain its footing’, Heller said. ‘Opposition forces currently pushing south will likely get stuck somewhere in Syria’s centre, when they run into really motivated and intractable loyalist resistance,’ he said. ‘At that point, it will be a question of whether Damascus has the means to mount the type of scorched-earth counteroffensive I assume it would like to execute.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/252100/rebels-capture-key-syrian-city-of-hama

"Policy swings, corruption lead to forex market crisis","Regulatory mood swings and corruption during the Awami League regime created disorderly conditions in the foreign exchange market, which led the foreign exchange reserves declining to levels too low for comfort, according to the White Paper on the State of Bangladesh economy submitted to chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on Sunday. The white paper submitted by a 12-member committee headed by economist Debapriya Bhattacharya observed that the Bangladesh Bank’s erratic policies, lack of transparency, and their consequences were responsible for the country’s financial health. ‘BB’s mood swings on exchange rate policy turned lethal when a multiple fixed exchange system was put in place in September 2022, disrupted the foreign exchange market. It discouraged the repatriation of export proceeds and remittance through formal channels and incentivised capital flight,’ it said. Confidence among international lenders deteriorated, leading to credit downgrades and reduced external financing options, it said. The government sought an International Monetary Fund programme to mitigate external imbalances, but policy inconsistencies remained a concern. Historically, the BB operated under a managed floating exchange rate system from 2003 to 2022, but the recent shift to a multiple fixed exchange rate regime marked a departure from this approach. The resulting market distortions highlighted the challenges of sustaining an artificially controlled exchange rate in the face of global and domestic pressures. With the dollar being central to Bangladesh’s trade and finance, underpricing and multiplicities in exchange rates created loopholes for bypassing the system. The report revealed that the BB overstated its foreign exchange reserves. While the central bank claimed $46 billion in June 2021, an IMF review identified only $39 billion in reserves. Trade and current account deficits exerted significant pressure on reserves. The trade deficit tripled from $9.5 billion in FY17 to $33.2 billion in FY22, while the current account deficit surged from $1.3 billion to $18.6 billion during the same period. These deficits were exacerbated by rising global commodity prices, a stronger US dollar, and declining exports to non-US markets. Another concerning trend was the rapid increase in unaccounted outflows, reported under errors and omissions. Between FY22 and FY24, these outflows totalled at $19 billion, compared with those of just $1.5 billion in the preceding three years. The report linked these figures to capital flights, saying that it was supported by anecdotal evidence of funds leaving the country before the August 2024 political transition. The foreign exchange market faced persistent shortages as BB’s interventions failed to address underlying issues. Artificially low exchange rates widened the gap between official and parallel markets, diverting dollar inflows to informal channels. Banks depleted their NOSTRO accounts, and the BB sold substantial amounts of foreign currency — $13.58 billion in FY23 and $12.79 billion in FY24 — to settle import bills, particularly for state-owned entities like the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation. However, a lack of public disclosure about these transactions fuelled speculation and mistrust. Exchange rate volatility further aggravated inflation. The taka depreciated steadily against the US dollar, moving from Tk 60 a dollar in FY2003 to Tk 84.81 in FY21, with sharper declines from FY22 onward. The US dollar reached a two-decade high in September 2022, driving inflation higher. The white paper noted a strong correlation between the exchange rate and inflation, with headline inflation and food inflation closely tracking currency depreciation. Corruption and regulatory inefficiencies during the Awami League regime eroded the credibility of Bangladesh’s financial institutions, exacerbating economic vulnerabilities, the report observed.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/252098/policy-swings-corruption-lead-to-forex-market-crisis
"Khayer, family members fined Tk 134.54cr for share price rigging","The Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday fined Abul Khayer, also known as Hiru, and his family members a total of Tk 134.54 crore for manipulating share prices of four companies. The stock market regulatory body made the disciplinary decision at a commission meeting held in its office in the capital Dhaka, according to a BSEC press release. The commission imposed fines on Abul Khayer, wife Kazi Sadia Hasan, father Abul Kalam Matber, mother Aleya Begum, sister Konika Afroze, brothers Sajed Madbar and Mohammad Basher, brother-in-law Kazi Fuad Hasan, and his company DIT Cooperative Ltd for manipulating prices of the shares of Fortune Shoes Limited, Delta Life Insurance Limited, NRB Commercial Bank Limited and Sonali Paper and Board Mills Limited. The BSEC release said that Abul Khayer and his family members manipulated prices of the shares of Fortune Shoes during October 3, 2021-October 26, 2021, those of the shares of Delta Life Insurance during September 9, 2021-October 26, 2021, those of the shares of NRB Commercial Bank during October 7, 2021-October 27, 2021, and those of the shares of Sonali Paper and Board Mills during June 28, 2021-October 27, 2021. Abul Khayer is a deputy registrar at the Department of Cooperatives, and the chairman of DIT Cooperative Ltd. The commission also fined Khayer-related Monarch Holdings Limited Tk 5 lakh for non-compliance with securities law by investing outside of its core business. It also decided to impose a fine of Tk 10,000 per day if Monarch Holdings fails to bring back the money in its own account within 30 working days. Cricketer Shakib Al Hasan, also a former lawmaker for the Magura-1 constituency, is the chairman of Monarch Holdings Ltd and Khayer’s wife Kazi Sadia Hasan is the managing director. Abul Khayer had been in discussion for share market manipulation since former BSEC chairman Shibli Rubayet Ul Islam joined the commission. Khayer and his family members along with other associates were fined multiple times previously for manipulating share prices. Over the span of four months in 2022, the stock market regulator fined Abul Khayer’s family members a combined Tk 12.4 crore for manipulating shares of eight companies. The BSEC at Thursday’s commission meeting also fined Sonali Paper and Board Mills’ chairman, managing director and a director Tk 20 lakh each for manipulating share prices of Paramount Insurance Company Ltd. Younus Group chairman Mohammed Younus, also a former chairman of Shahjalal Islami Bank, is the chairman of Sonali Paper. Younus’s wife and company’s managing director Mahfuza Younus and their son and lone shareholder director Mohammed Javed Noman were asked to pay the fine from their personal accounts. The BSEC also fined Mahfuza Akhter Tk 10 lakh and Dewan Salehin Mahmud Tk 40 lakh for manipulating share prices of Prime Finance First Mutual Fund during November 23, 2023-December 19, 2023.

Govt brings 15 new industrial sectors under wage regulations,"The government has brought 15 new industrial sectors under wage regulations with the aim of ensuring minimum wages for thousands of workers engaged in these industries. With this inclusion, the total number of formal industrial sectors covered under wage regulations has been increased to 57. The newly included sectors are private clinics, hospitals, and diagnostic centres, fertiliser factories, brickfields, private airlines, producers of electric and electronic goods, ceramics, cement, batteries, poultry, commercial amusement parks, dry fish producers,  stone crushing, IT parks, colour and chemical factories, and milk products and dairy farms. Among these 15 sectors, the government has already established separate wage boards to determine minimum monthly wages for workers in four sectors — ceramics, cement, battery production and poultry. A wage board official mentioned that they were awaiting the formation of 11 additional boards, which required the appointment of representatives from both workers and employers. Labour secretary AHM Shafiquzzaman said that the inclusion of 15 industrial sectors to the formal wage framework would benefit thousands of workers across the country. He said that the initiative had been taken with the aim of upholding the rights of workers. The labour secretary also mentioned that many other informal sectors would gradually be brought under the formal wage regulations. Labour ministry officials said that workers in these sectors currently received wages at varying rates, even within the same sector, without any structured framework. They also said that due to lack of formalisation there was no government monitoring in place in the sectors. According to the labour ministry officials, the establishment of minimum wages would ensure workers a lawful wage structure, prohibiting employers from paying less than the government-set minimum. They said that inclusion under the wage framework would also grant workers access to additional legal benefits.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/252096/govt-brings-15-new-industrial-sectors-under-wage-regulations
President seeks more Malaysian investment in Bangladesh,"President Mohammed Shahabuddin has urged Malaysian investors to come up with more invests in various sectors, including Special Economic Zones, in Bangladesh.

Welcoming the new Malaysian HC to Bangladesh, the president said that bilateral ties between Malaysia and Bangladesh in different sectors, including trade and investment, were very excellent, president’s press secretary Md Joynal Abedin told the BSS subsequently. The head of state said that the recent visit of the Malaysian prime minister in Dhaka had opened a new chapter of the bilateral relations between the two countries. Mentioning that Malaysia is one of the destinations for Bangladeshi manpower, president Shahabuddin said that the Bangladeshi labour force played an important role in the economic development of both the states. The president requested the Malaysian government to take effective steps about 18,000 Bangladeshi workers, who could not go to Malaysia in time earlier. Noting that Bangladesh is Malaysia’s second largest trading partner in South Asia, he hoped that bilateral trade and investment relations would further expand in the days to come. Malaysia would assume the chairmanship of ASEAN next month, the president said, further expressing hope that Malaysia would cooperate and support Bangladesh in becoming a sectoral dialogue partner of the ASEAN. The new high commissioner would take necessary measures to reach the existing relation in a new height during his assignment in Bangladesh, the president expected. During the meeting, the new Malaysian high commissioner expressed his determination to make all-out efforts to increase bilateral trade and investment. He sought the president’s overall cooperation in discharging his duties.

Yunus’s UN proposal to resolve Rohingya crisis,"UPON publication of the report by the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State led by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan in August 2017, there should not have been any debate over the Rohingya people’s nationality and citizenship issues. According to media reports, in 2017, Myanmar and Bangladesh signed an agreement regarding the repatriation of the stranded Rohingya people, which was supposed to start from January 2018. In contrast to Bangladesh’s proposal of 15,000 Rohingya repatriations per week, Myanmar agreed to accept 1,500 initially and to increase the rate at a three-month review, with the repatriation of 740,000 Rohingyas, who had taken shelter in Bangladesh in 2016 and 2017, supposed to have been completed within two years. Little progress has been made so far, however. Considering this backdrop, the chief adviser to Bangladesh’s interim government, Professor Yunus, should be commended for his recent appeal to the United Nations. On September 24, 2024, requesting a pragmatic solution to the Rohingya crisis, he presented a three-point proposal at the UN General Assembly’s sideline session. His first proposal requested that the UN Secretary-General organise a conference on the Rohingya crisis, inviting all stakeholders at the soonest possible opportunity. In this regard, Myanmar’s obligation to uphold the rights of the Rohingya people warrants further discussion. Firstly, the Rohingya people have been living in Myanmar for at least several generations. They should not be considered stateless. Rather, they should be regarded with honour and dignity. Articles 1, 2, 3, 5 and 15 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) ensure every person’s basic human rights, including living with dignity, freedom and non-coercion. Moreover, Article 15 of the same declaration affirms that every person has the right to a nationality and that no one can be arbitrarily denied this. Myanmar was one of the first 48 countries that voted in support of that declaration in 1948. Secondly, even if considered stateless, as they have been rendered by Myanmar’s 1982 citizenship law, the Rohingya people cannot remain the victims of discrimination. In this respect, the UN Conventions on Statelessness (1954) and the Reduction of Statelessness (1961) may be mentioned. Article 3 of the 1954 Convention ensures non-discrimination and Article 1 of the 1961 Convention ensures ‘citizenship at birth’ to a child who would ‘otherwise be stateless’. Although Myanmar is not a party to either of these two conventions, being a UN member state, Myanmar does need to comply with the ‘non-discrimination’ terms of the UN Declaration (1948) mentioned above. Further, it also needs to comply with the ‘citizenship at birth’ terms, which fall under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (mentioned later). Thirdly, Myanmar has ratified and/or accessed (both have the same legal effect) several other UN conventions and/or protocols relevant to today’s discussion. For example, the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the 2000 Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children, and the International Labour Organisation’s Forced Labour Convention (1930). Researchers and historians mention that the Rohingya people are the victims of forced labour, and many of the women are the victims of abuse. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime defines human trafficking as involving three key components: the ‘what’ (such as recruitment, transportation, and transfer), the ‘how’ (which includes methods like threat, coercion, or abduction), and the ‘why’ (typically for purposes such as sexual exploitation or forced labour). In light of these elements, the treatment of the Rohingya people, both in the recent past and historical contexts, can be classified as trafficking in persons. This treatment represents a violation of multiple international conventions, specifically non-compliance with Article 6 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, Article 1.1 of the Forced Labour Convention, and the failure to conform to the objectives outlined in Article 2a and 2b of the Trafficking in Persons Protocol. In principle, Myanmar is obligated under these international agreements to treat the Rohingya people in a manner consistent with the protections established by these conventions. Additionally, Myanmar is a state party to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (1951). The UN and leading international rights bodies, including Amnesty International and Fortify Rights, termed the 2017 killing of the Rohingya as ethnic cleansing and/or genocide. Global humanitarian and state actors may therefore take necessary steps to ensure Myanmar follows its obligations in compliance with Article 1 of this convention and thereby prevents genocide. It is Myanmar’s responsibility to establish conditions that encourage the Rohingya people living in Bangladeshi camps to opt for voluntary repatriation. Finally, considering the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989), children should in no way be the victims of any persecution. It was made evident by the media that the dead bodies of innocent children were floating on the Naf River during the 2017 massacre carried out by the Myanmar army. The UNCRC Articles 7 and 8 ensure every child’s identity, protection, and nationality ‘immediately after birth’. Myanmar became a state party to the UNCRC in 1991. Additionally, Article 7 asserts that the national law of signatory states should be guided by relevant international instruments, especially when there is the possibility of a child ‘otherwise becom[ing] stateless’. This convention makes it clear that states do not need to wait for the child to attain adulthood to claim citizenship. On behalf of the people of Bangladesh, we would urge the UN Secretary-General to honour Professor Yunus’ call and take necessary measures to organise an all-stakeholders’ conference at the soonest possible time. Indeed, the conference could bring a ground-breaking opportunity to resolve this protracted crisis by converging refugee and non-refugee actors and ensuring healthy debates among all. Furthermore, it would facilitate the creation of Rohingya leadership, who could be the most active and agile advocates to make their voices heard in bringing the crisis to an end. We would like to see the UN’s effective facilitating role in revitalising the repatriation deal from Myanmar’s side. We also expect that the Rohingya people will be treated in compliance with the relevant UN conventions. We do believe that these people’s human rights should be upheld and that they should thereby be able to live with freedom and dignity, whether living in Myanmar or returning from Bangladesh under the repatriation process.

HC acquits Giasuddin Al Mamun in money laundering case,"The High Court on Thursday acquitted Giasuddin Al Mamun, a businessman and close friend of the BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, in a money laundering case scrapping his seven-year jail sentence. An HC bench of Justice AKM Asaduzzaman and Justice Syed Enayet Hossain passed the order after hearing a petition submitted challenging the judgment. Lawyers Omar Sadat and Sabbir Hamza stood the petitioner while Asif Hasan for the Anti-Corruption Commissioner. On September 22, 2011, the ACC filed a case against Giasuddin Al Mamun with Cantonment police station in Dhaka. According to the case statement, M Shahjad Ali, the then chairman of BTL and Globe Pharmaceuticals, was the Bangladesh agent for a Dutch contracting company that won a tender to modernise the railway signaling system. In 2003, when the work order was finalised, Giasuddin Al Mamun allegedly demanded an illegal commission for the work. In 2004, Shahjad deposited Tk 6, 015, 7762 into Mamun’s NatWest Bank account in London. On April 24, 2019, the Special Judge Court of Dhaka sentenced Giasuddin Al Mamun to seven years in jail and imposed a fine of Tk 12 crore.

Verdict on 15th amendment’s constitutionality on Dec 17,"The High Court has scheduled December 17 to announce its verdict on two writ petitions challenging the constitutionality of the 15th amendment to the constitution, which abolished the election-time caretaker government system in 2011 during the Awami League regime. The bench of Justice Farah Mahbub and Justice Debasish Roy Chowdhury set the date on Thursday, following the conclusion of the final hearing on Wednesday. One of the writ petitions was filed by five eminent citizens, including Shushashoner Jonno Nagorik president M Hafizuddin Khan, its founding secretary Badiul Alam Majumder, and local governance expert Tofail Ahmed. Another petition was submitted by freedom fighter Mofazzal Hossain from Naogaon, challenging the inclusion of certain provisions in the constitution through the 15th amendment. Senior lawyer Sharif Bhuiyan, representing the five citizens, argued for scrapping the 15th amendment in its entirety, calling it a threat to democratic norms and constitutional balance. Several political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, and Gano Forum, as well as other interveners, have also challenged the 15th amendment. These groups have urged for reforms to ensure greater democratic accountability, alleging that the amendment entrenched mechanisms favoring authoritarianism and indefinite rule by the ruling party. Attorney general Md Asaduzzaman, representing the state, defended specific provisions of the 15th amendment, particularly Article 2A, which guarantees equal rights for all faiths while designating Islam as the state religion. At the same time, he criticised the 15th amendment for enabling an authoritarian framework, undermining democratic integrity, and consolidating ruling party dominance. The impending verdict is expected to have far-reaching implications for Bangladesh’s political and constitutional landscape, potentially reshaping the balance of power and democratic governance in the country. Former attorney general Fida M Kamal criticised the 15th amendment, particularly the inclusion of article 7B, which rendered certain constitutional provisions unamendable. He argued that the article undermined the constitution’s fluidity and adaptability likening it to rigid religious texts. ‘Article 7B imposes undue restrictions on future parliaments, violating the principle that the constitution is a living document meant to evolve with societal needs’ Fida contended.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252079/verdict-on-15th-amendments-constitutionality-on-dec-17
"Religious leaders for nat’l unity, harmony in Bangladesh","Leaders from various religious communities on Thursday called for maintaining religious harmony and national unity, to save the interest, sovereignty and existence of the nation amid propaganda against Bangladesh over religious minority issues. They also extended their support to the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government for maintaining religious harmony and resisting conspiracies against the country. Leaders from Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and Christian communities gave the call from a dialogue with the chief adviser held at the Foreign Service Academy in Dhaka city amid ongoing anti-Bangladesh propaganda in the Indian media regarding Hindu minority issues. The religious leaders also urged the government to take immediate measures in cases of incidents breaching safety of the minority communities to ensure communal harmony and a Bangladesh where the people across religious beliefs could live free from fear. At the meeting, the religions leaders also proposed to hold a world peace and harmony rally in the capital, bringing together people of all religions and communities. Referring to his earlier speech, the chief adviser at the meeting said, ‘We all are a family despite having differences of opinions. We are not enemies to each other. We all are Bangladeshis.’ Saying that there existed no division among Bangladeshis when it came to national interest, Yunus said that his government envisioned a ‘new Bangladesh’ where everyone would be able to access accurate information. He sought cooperation from the religious leaders in collecting accurate information if any attack on minorities took place anywhere. Saying that the news of attacks on minority once again came on the foreign media, the chief adviser mentioned that a stark gap existed between the foreign media news and the ground reality. ‘We want to know the accurate information and want to establish the process of getting the information, he added. If any incident of attack on minorities takes place in the country, information must be collected immediately and the perpetrators must be brought to justice, he added. The chief adviser stressed taking measures to create an environment to prevent such incidents and ensuring immediate remedy for victims. After the meeting, an adviser to the interim government Mahfuz Alam told journalists that the government would work proactively to prevent any conspiracy at any cost. ‘The government will not shelter or patronise rash activities. Rather, we will move towards creating a national unity,’ he said. He said that in the existing situation, the chief adviser would again hold a large-scale dialogue with the country’s student organisations. Mahfuz said, ‘we should have people of all parties, views, paths and religions stand on a strong political platform and make Bangladesh stand on the world stage. So, we have sought the support of the religious leaders.’ ‘They have lent their unwavering support. We hope that the pace at which Bangladesh is moving and national unity is being forged, the nation will go far in the future,’ he added. He urged the media to present accurate information on communal issues. Regarding propaganda by the Indian media, he said ‘Propaganda is a threat to the friendship of the two countries. We hope they will be convinced.’ After the meeting, As sunnah Foundation chairman Mufti Ahmed Ullah said, ‘We are united and will remain united. We, Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, all want to take this country forward.’ ‘We have no religious differences. We have tried to give the message that the world and the people of the country should not get confused by the propaganda that is trying to sow division amongst us,’ he said. ‘After the murder of lawyer Alif, Muslims all over Bangladesh have shown great restraint. We have all spoken so that we do not listen to any propaganda and we are all united,’ Mahfuz stated. Father Albert Rosario of St Mary’s Cathedral in Ramna said, ‘We are going through a sensitive time right now. Our main thing at this time is to remain united.’ He said, ‘We have to heal the wounds that have been created in the minds of people in the wake of the ISKCON incident. Many of those who are suffering and who have been angered by this incident have not come today. I have been saying that the chief adviser should sit with them.’ ‘I have also said that we should organise such an event so that people all over the world know that the people of Bangladesh are in communal harmony, they live together, they walk together,’ he said. ‘The people of the country have shown a lot of patience in the incident of the death of our lawyer. Even then, some Indian media have broadcast provocative news that does not match the reality. Our harmony has been repeatedly disrupted.’ ‘We have also emphasised that if the law allows for the bail of our ISKCON brother who is arrested and in jail, his bail should be considered,’ he said. Bangladesh Buddhist Federation general secretary Bhikkhu Sunanda Priya said, ‘We have said that communal harmony should be maintained in the country. We should be able to live in harmony.’ Ramna Harichand Temple assistant secretary Avinash Mitra said, ‘Those of us who are in Bangladesh there is no division among us. But where is the division? Those who are creating division are spreading propaganda by sitting abroad.’ ‘We do not want them to get any personal gains. This is Bangladesh. We are all equally united here,’ he added. Garo priest Johnson Murry Thamal said, ‘We are united, we will resist those who are spreading propaganda in the media. We will cooperate with this government.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252078/religious-leaders-for-natl-unity-harmony-in-bangladesh

"27 EU envoys stationed in Dhaka, Delhi to meet Bangladesh interim chief on Dec 9","Diplomats representing 27 countries of European Union — 20 of them stationed in New Delhi and the rest seven in Dhaka — are set to meet interim government chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on December 9 in Dhaka. This will be the first such gathering of 27 ambassadors from the European Union member countries to express their support for Bangladesh and explore new areas and ways for further cooperation with the government at a time when the country is going through a transition after the fall of the authoritarian regime of Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India for shelter amid a student-led mass uprising on August 5. ‘Both sides will explore new areas of cooperation in the meeting beside discussion on Rohingya crisis,  climate issues, GSP+ facilities for Bangladesh in the post-LDC era,’ said foreign ministry spokesperson and director general for public diplomacy wing Mohammad Rafiqul Alam at the weekly briefing at his Segunbagicha office on Thursday while disclosing the date for the crucial meeting. Ambassador and head of delegation of the European Union to Bangladesh Michael Miller would also join the European countries’ envoys in the meeting with Muhammad Yunus in Dhaka. Earlier on November 17, chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said that 27 ambassadors of all the countries of European Union would meet him in the next few days without giving any date. ‘Twenty ambassadors from 20 European Union countries based in Delhi along with seven ambassadors from seven countries based in Dhaka are coming to Dhaka in the next few days to meet me,’ Yunus said in his televised speech address to the nation marking 100 days of the government on that day. Three days after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government, Nobel laureate Yunus took over as the chief adviser of the interim government on August 8. ‘Never before did 27 ambassadors from the EU come together to discuss with the government,’ the chief adviser said. The reason for this gathering was to express the EU support and to develop high-level cooperation in the economic field, he said, adding that ambassadors from many countries, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Finland, Singapore, Libya, have already met him.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/252075/27-eu-envoys-stationed-in-dhaka-delhi-to-meet-bangladesh-interim-chief-on-dec-9
BB starts printing new notes with graffiti of July uprising,"Bangladesh Bank is printing new notes changing the existing design with the inclusion of features of July uprising. According to the central bank, the banknotes of Tk 20, Tk 100, Tk 500, and Tk 1000 are being printed as per instruction of the interim government. The new notes will not include image of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Religious structures, Bengali traditions, and ‘graffiti’ drawn during the July uprising will be included, it said. The new notes are expected to be released in the market within the next six months. The officials concerned of the central bank and the Ministry of Finance said the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman will be removed from the current notes. Initially, the design of the four notes is being changed and the design of all types of banknotes will be redesigned in phases, they said. Earlier, on September 29, the Finance Institute Division, Ministry of Finance, wrote to the BB to submit a detailed design proposal for the new note. However, the main recommendation on printing new notes will be made by the central bank’s Currency and Design Advisory Committee. BB spokesperson and executive director Husneara Shikha said the matter of printing new notes had come a long way. ‘I hope the new noted could be released in the market within the next six months.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/252074/bb-starts-printing-new-notes-with-graffiti-of-july-uprising

City needed to break losing routine: Guardiola,"Pep Guardiola said Manchester City had to break the habit of losing after snapping a seven-game winless streak by beating Nottingham Forest 3-0 on Wednesday. The English champions' barren run included six defeats, the worst run of Guardiola's managerial career. However, victory came at a cost as defenders Nathan Ake and Manuel Akanji had to be replaced due to injuries. ‘We needed it. The club, the players needed to win but it is just one game,’ said Guardiola. ‘The problems continue with Manu and Nathan. ‘In general, the most important thing was to break this routine of not winning games and finally we won, but we have to continue.’ Injury woes have been at the heart of City's struggles in recent months with Ballon d'Or winner Rodri out for the season due to a serious knee problem. Kevin De Bruyne's return to the starting line-up for the first time in nearly three months showed what City have been missing as he helped restore order for Guardiola's men. The Belgian teed up Bernardo Silva for an early opener and then fired home himself to double City's lead. Jeremy Doku rounded off the scoring in the second half as the home side did not suffer a repeat of last week's collapse from 3-0 up to draw 3-3 against Feyenoord in the Champions League. Guardiola dismissed suggestions before the game that there had been a rift with De Bruyne as he has been carefully managed back from injury problems. ‘Last season was many months (out injured) and this season as well. I'm so happy he's back,’ added Guardiola. ‘He fought a lot. In respect to his physicality and minutes against Feyenoord was not good and that's why I decided not to play at Anfield (against Liverpool) for the rhythm they play. ‘But the minutes he played at Anfield were really good and today he played 75 fantastic minutes.’ Neither Akanji or Ake are expected to be fit to face Crystal Palace on Saturday, but Phil Foden could return after missing the Forest match due to bronchitis.

"Rahul to open for India, Rohit drops down order in 2nd Australia Test","Rohit Sharma will bat down the order in the pink-ball second Test against Australia in Adelaide, with India's returning skipper Thursday saying KL Rahul had earned his place as an opener. Rohit, who usually opens, missed their 295-run first Test victory in Perth last week for the birth of his second child. In his place, Rahul scored a patient 26 in the first innings then a solid 77 in a crucial 201-run opening stand with century-maker Yashasvi Jaiswal. ‘KL will open. The way he batted and his partnership with Jaiswal was instrumental in that first Test win,’ said Rohit ahead of the game starting on Friday. ‘The way he has batted outside India, he deserves it. I will bat somewhere in the middle. ‘It was a fairly simple decision. Personally, it wasn't easy, but for the team, it was an easy decision to make.’ Rohit would not reveal India's starting XI, nor where exactly he will bat. But with regular number three Shubman Gill set to return from a thumb injury, he will probably come in at five, after Virat Kohli and before Rishabh Pant. Devdutt Padikkal and Dhruv Jurel appear likely to make way. Veteran spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and allrounder Ravindra Jadeja were both overlooked for Perth and it remains unclear whether they will play. But Rohit said they remained integral to the five-Test series. ‘Unfortunately I wasn't there to break the news to them that they won't be playing that first game,’ he said. ‘It's always hard to leave experienced players like them out. ‘But I think the decision was made for what was best for the team at that particular time... and that is I think what we will throughout the series look to do. ‘But I certainly see them playing a huge role in the rest of the series because what they bring to the table can never be written off. They are quality players.’ Despite brimming with confidence after their victory in Perth, Rohit admitted that playing under lights with a pink ball at Adelaide Oval would be challenging. Australia have won all seven of its day-night Tests at the venue including an eight-wicket win over India in 2020 when they were all out for 36 in their second innings. ‘You are so used to playing with a red ball and the pink ball certainly does a little bit more than the red ball,’ Rohit said. ‘At the same time we have been training here for the past three days and I certainly felt that the more time you spend playing the pink ball, it gets a little easier. ‘The pink ball will have its challenges under lights, during the day as well -- you just have to find your own way of dealing with it.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/252067/rahul-to-open-for-india-rohit-drops-down-order-in-2nd-australia-test
"Ousted Hasina destroyed everything, chief adviser Yunus tells Nikkei Asia","Bangladesh interim government chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has said the previous regime led by deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina ‘destroyed everything,’ as he pledged to hold general elections only after ushering in constitutional and judicial reforms, including an electoral overhaul. He said this in an exclusive interview with Japanese newspaper Nikkei Asia on Saturday last as the interview was published on its website on Monday. ‘We need comprehensive reforms in the economy, governance, bureaucracy and judiciary [before holding elections],’ the chief adviser said. Bangladesh’s interim government has established several commissions to promote reforms in areas such as the electoral system, constitution and judiciary, Nikkei report quoted him as saying. Professor Yunus said the government would implement full-scale reforms after receiving recommendations from those commissions by January. He said, ‘Implementing these reforms will take time, as we are essentially building a “new Bangladesh” from scratch.’ Asked if he would run in the election, he rejected the idea, saying, ‘No, I’m not a politician. I’ve always stayed away from politics.’ ‘Individuals who uphold principles, follow rules and procedures and are free from corruption should stand for election,’ he added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252066/ousted-hasina-destroyed-everything-chief-adviser-yunus-tells-nikkei-asia
Prime suspect of lawyer Saiful murder arrested,"The police arrested the prime suspect Chandan Das in lawyer Saiful Islam Alif murder case at Bhairab Railway Station in Kishoreganj early Thursday. Confirming the arrest, Chattogram Metropolitan Police additional deputy commissioner Kazi Md Tarek Aziz said that he was arrested at about 12:15am on Thursday. ‘Chandan is now in the custody of Bhairab police station,’ he said, adding that Chandan Das, 35, is son of the late Dhari of Methorpatti area in Sevak Colony under the Kotwali Police Station in Chattogram city. ‘A joint team from Bhairab Police Station and Chattogram’s Kotwali Police Station arrested him on information. In the video footage, he was seen wearing an orange T-shirt and black pants. Chandan Das is being taken to Chattogram for the next legal course of action,’ CMP ADC Tarek said. Saiful, an assistant public prosecutor in Chattogram, was hacked to death during a clash between the members of law enforcement agencies and followers of Hindu community leader Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari near the Chattogram court area on November 26 while sending Chinmoy to jail in a sedition case. According to CMP officials, Chandan arrived at Bhairab Railway Station at 7:30pm on Wednesday as his in-laws house is located at Methorpatti, Bhairab.

ICT bans publication of Hasina’s hate speech,"The International Crimes Tribunal on Thursday asked the government to ban the broadcasting and publication of any ‘hate speech’ or ‘incitement’ allegedly made by deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India amid the student-people uprising on August 5. The order followed Hasina’s implication in a filed on charges of crimes against humanity for over 1,500 murders and scores of injuries in indiscriminate firing, torture and other atrocities during the July-August uprising. The tribunal of Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder, Justice Md Shofiul Alam Mahmood and retired district judge Md Mohitul Haq Anam Chowdhury passed the order after hearing a petition filed by chief prosecutor Md Tajul Islam. The tribunal asked its registrar to immediately notify the secretaries of the ministries of information and broadcasting and information and communication technology as well as the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission chairman to enforce the order. It also asked the respondents to ensure the removal of all inflammatory content linked to Hasina from print, electronic and social media platforms. The tribunal also took note of reported leaked telephone conversations between Hasina, also the Awami League president, and her party leaders that went viral on social media and were widely circulated in the press. In the leaked conversations, Hasina reportedly asked AL leaders to hold rallies displaying images of US president-elect Donald Trump and urged her supporters to retaliate against those who reportedly attacked the homes of AL members. Prosecutor Tamim Gazi Monwar Hossain argued that these statements met the criteria for hate speech as outlined in the United Nations’ Rabat Plan of Action. The framework proposes a six-point threshold test, considers elements such as the context, speaker, intent, content, reach, and likelihood, including imminence, to determine whether an expression qualifies as criminal incitement. Tamim emphasised that Hasina’s statements clearly fell within the parameters of incitement as defined by the Rabat Principles. Tamim warned that Hasina’s rhetoric could obstruct the ongoing investigation into allegations of crimes against humanity and jeopardise the safety of witnesses and victims connected to the case. The case accuses Hasina and her affiliates of orchestrating violence during the July-August movement, resulting in widespread deaths, injuries, and destruction. The prosecution filed the application seeking ban on publication of Hasina’s speech following an amendment to section 23A of the amended International Crimes (Tribunals) Act ICT mandating tribunals to ‘take all necessary measures’ to ensure the safety, security, and well-being of witnesses providing testimony or evidence in proceedings under the act. Section 23(2)(B) further empowers the tribunals to ‘order any protective measures deemed necessary to safeguard victims,’ either on their own initiative or upon a request from the prosecution or the victims. On November 12, the tribunal directed the inspector general of police to request the Interpol to issue red notices for the arrest of Hasina and several of her associates. Hasina, along with 46 cabinet members, party leaders and associates, faces arrest orders issued by the tribunal on October 17. Chief prosecutor Md Tajul Islam informed the tribunal that steps were under way to secure Interpol assistance and a red notice would be sent to Hasina.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252064/ict-bans-publication-of-hasinas-hate-speech-
"ADB, MGI sign deal to construct energy-efficient flour mill in Bangladesh","The Asian Development Bank and Tanveer Dal Mill and Flour Mills Limited, a member of the Meghna Group of Industries, have signed a $20 million-loan agreement to support construction of a greenfield state-of-the-art, energy-efficient flour milling plant in Bangladesh. This new facility will double MGI’s wheat flour output and enable the production of quality wheat products while consuming 37 per cent less electricity than existing plants. The improved energy efficiency is expected to lower operational costs and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 8,200 tonnes annually. The plant will produce 6,60,000 tonnes of wheat, contributing to domestic agriculture production and enhancing food security, said an ADB press release on Thursday. ‘This project marks a significant step toward the advancement of sustainable industrial development in Bangladesh. By promoting energy-efficient technologies and improving product quality, ADB and MGI are directly contributing to the country’s food security, food safety, economic resilience and environmental sustainability,’ said ADB director general for private sector operations Suzanne Gaboury. ‘Furthermore, the project is aligned with the Government of Bangladesh’s goals of strengthening domestic agro-processing and reducing the energy intensity of key industries,’ added Suzanne. The demand for wheat in Bangladesh has been steadily increasing, but domestic production has not kept pace. In 2022, the country consumed about 8.8 million tonnes of wheat, while local production exceeded only one million tons. This reliance on imported wheat highlights the urgent need to expand domestic milling capacity. With the anticipated rise in demand for flour milling, investing in energy-efficient technologies will foster environmentally sustainable growth in this sector. ‘The project will ensure food security, create additional employment opportunities for 160 individuals, foster relationships with 1,50,000 vendors in the SME sector, support market creation and industrialization, and more importantly, contribute sustainable GDP growth in the Bangladesh economy,’ said MGI’s chairman and managing director Mostafa Kamal. ‘We are enthusiastic about working with ADB and this project demonstrates the group’s commitment to due diligence and compliance,’ added Kamal.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/252063/adb-mgi-sign-deal-to-construct-energy-efficient-flour-mill-in-bangladesh

13 people missing as railway construction site collapses in south China,"Thirteen people are missing after a cave-in at a construction site for a major railway in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, local authorities said Thursday. The ground under a section of the Shenzhen-Jiangmen railway site ‘suddenly collapsed’ around 11:00pm  Wednesday, according to a statement from the Bao'an District emergency management bureau. A search for the missing was ongoing Thursday morning, and the cause of the collapse was being investigated, officials said.

French lawmakers debate no-confidence motions against govt,"France’s lower house of parliament Wednesday started debating two no-confidence motions in a session widely expected to topple the minority government of prime minister Michel Barnier in a historic vote. The ousting of the Barnier government after just three months in office would deepen the country’s political crisis and present president Emmanuel Macron with the unenviable choice of picking a viable successor with over two years of his presidential term left. The National Assembly lower house debated two motions brought by the hard left and the far right in a standoff over next year’s austerity budget, after the prime minister on Monday forced through a social security financing bill without a vote. ‘The worst policy would be not to block such a budget,’ three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen said during the parliamentary debate, urging lawmakers to vote out the government of Macron and its ‘technocratic’ choices. The motion brought by Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party was expected to be rejected. But Le Pen has said her forces would back the left’s motion, giving it enough numbers to pass a vote that was expected to topple a French government for the first time in more than 60 years. The first results were expected around 1900 GMT. Eric Coquerel, a hard-left MP, said the motion against Barnier sounded the ‘death knell of Emmanuel Macron’s mandate.’ The French president was ‘today an obstacle, and in no way a solution. Today we are voting to censure your government, but more than anything else, we are sounding the death knell for a mandate: that of the president,’ he added. Macron wrapped up his three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia and was returning to Paris. A world away from the crisis, he strolled earlier Wednesday through the desert sands of the Al-Ula oasis, an iconic tourist project of the kingdom, marvelling at ancient landmarks. On Tuesday, Macron accused Le Pen’s far-right of ‘unbearable cynicism’ in backing the motion. In France, Barnier said he believed his government could still survive. ‘I want this and it is possible,’ Barnier said late Tuesday. He accused Le Pen of ‘trying to get into a kind of bidding war’ in their talks. The turmoil follows a snap parliamentary election called by Macron in the summer that tried and failed to halt the march of the far right. The result left the RN as the largest single party in the National Assembly but with no faction holding a majority. Barnier took office with Le Pen becoming a potential kingmaker, and her party saying it could topple the administration at nearly any point of its choosing. No new elections can be called within a year of last summer’s vote, narrowing Macron’s options. Some have suggested Macron himself should resign to break the impasse. But Macron rejected those calls, saying such a scenario amounted to ‘political fiction’. ‘It’s frankly not up to scratch to say these things,’ Macron said. With markets nervous and France bracing for public-sector strikes over the threat of cutbacks that will shut down schools and hit air and rail traffic, there is a growing sense of crisis. The unions have called for civil servants, including teachers and air traffic controllers, to strike on Thursday over separate cost-cutting measures proposed by their respective ministries this autumn. ‘His failure,’ was left-wing daily Liberation’s front-page headline, with a picture of Macron, whose term runs until 2027. In an editorial, Le Monde said Le Pen’s move risked upsetting her own supporters, such as retirees and business leaders, by toppling the government. ‘In the space of a few minutes, she shattered the strategy of normalisation she had consistently pursued,’ the daily said. Some observers have suggested that Le Pen, 56, is seeking to bring down Macron before his term ends by ousting Barnier. Le Pen is embroiled in a high-profile embezzlement trial. If found guilty in March, she could be blocked from participating in France’s next presidential election. But if Macron stepped down soon, an election would have to be called within a month, potentially ahead of the verdict in her trial. Candidates for the post of premier are few and far between, but loyalist defence minister Sebastien Lecornu and Macron’s centrist ally Francois Bayrou are possible contenders. On the left, Macron could turn to former Socialist premier and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve, a contender in September. If the government falls, it would be the first successful no-confidence vote since a defeat for Georges Pompidou’s government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president. The lifespan of Barnier’s government would be the shortest of any administration since the Fifth Republic began in 1958.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252056/french-lawmakers-debate-no-confidence-motions-against-govt
Macron seeks remedy as France parliament votes to oust PM,"French president Emmanuel Macron is set to seek on Thursday ways out of France’s political crisis, after Michel Barnier became the first prime minister to be ousted by parliament in over six decades. Lawmakers voted on Wednesday to oust Barnier’s government after just three months in office, approving a no-confidence motion proposed by the hard left but which crucially was backed by the far right headed by Marine Le Pen. Barnier’s record-quick ejection comes after snap parliamentary elections this summer, which resulted in a hung parliament with no party having an overall majority and the far right holding the key to the government’s survival. Macron now has the unenviable task of picking a viable successor with over two years of his presidential term left, with some — though not all — opponents calling on him to resign. Barnier is due to present Macron his government’s resignation on Thursday morning. The president will then address the nation at 1900 GMT, the Elysee said. The no-confidence motion, brought by the hard left in the National Assembly, came amid a standoff over next year’s austerity budget, after the prime minister on Monday forced through a social security financing bill without a vote. With the support of the far right, a majority of 331 lawmakers in the 577-member chamber voted to oust the government. It was the first successful no-confidence vote since a defeat for Georges Pompidou’s government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president. Macron flew back into Paris just ahead of the vote after wrapping up a three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia, an apparent world away from the domestic crisis. He strolled earlier Wednesday through the desert sands of the Al-Ula oasis, marvelling at ancient landmarks. After landing in Paris, he headed directly to the Elysee Palace. ‘We are now calling on Macron to go,’ Mathilde Panot, head of the parliamentary faction of the hard-left France Unbowed party, told reporters, urging ‘early presidential election’ to solve the deepening political crisis. But taking care not to crow over the government’s fall, Le Pen said in a television interview that her party — once a new premier is appointed — ‘would let them work’ and help create a ‘budget that is acceptable for everyone’. Laurent Wauquiez, the head of right-wing deputies in parliament, said the far right and hard left bore the responsibility for a no-confidence vote that will ‘plunge the country into instability’. Candidates for the post of premier are few, but loyalist Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu and Macron’s centrist ally Francois Bayrou are possible contenders. On the left, Macron could turn to former Socialist premier and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve, a contender in September. Barnier was the fifth prime minister to serve under Macron since he came to power in 2017, with every premier serving a successively shorter period. Given the turbulence, the new nominee now risks serving an even shorter term than Barnier, whose tenure was the shortest of any administration since the Fifth Republic began in 1958. Macron is minded to appoint the new premier rapidly, several sources told AFP. A source close to Macron said the president, who has taken time with appointments in the past, has ‘no choice’ but to name the new premier within 24 hours. Macron has rejected calls to resign. With markets nervous and France bracing for public-sector strikes against the threat of cutbacks, action that will shut schools and hit air and rail traffic, there is a growing sense of crisis. The unions have called for civil servants, including teachers and air-traffic controllers, to strike on Thursday over separate cost-cutting measures. Meanwhile, Macron is due to host a major international event Saturday, with the reopening of the Notre-Dame cathedral after the 2019 fire, with guests including Donald Trump on his first foreign trip since he was elected to be the next US president. ‘His failure,’ was left-wing daily Liberation’s front-page headline, with a picture of Macron, whose term runs until 2027. In an editorial, Le Monde said Le Pen’s move risked upsetting her own supporters, such as retirees and business leaders, by toppling the government. ‘In the space of a few minutes, she shattered the strategy of normalisation she had consistently pursued,’ the daily said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252055/macron-seeks-remedy-as-france-parliament-votes-to-oust-pm-

French navy rescues 85 migrants in Channel,"The French navy rescued 85 migrants trying to cross the Channel from France to England on Wednesday, maritime authorities said, the latest in a deadly series of dangerous crossings. One of ‘numerous’ migrant boats that set out to sea called for help after hitting a sandbank off the Pas-de-Calais region, France’s Channel and North Sea maritime prefecture said in a statement. A navy tugboat saved 80 passengers from that boat and five more from a second migrant vessel at another location, it said. The migrants were brought back to land at Boulogne-sur-Mer and attended to by emergency services and border police. More than 70 migrants have died trying to cross the Channel to Britain this year, according to the Pas-de-Calais authorities. Tens of thousands more have reached Britain, whose government has vowed to crack down on people-smuggling gangs. In Germany on Wednesday, police carried out pre-dawn raids targeting an alleged Syrian and Iraqi-Kurdish criminal network accused of smuggling migrants by boat from France to Britain.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/252053/french-navy-rescues-85-migrants-in-channel

Passengers continue to suffer as trains run late,"Passengers continued to suffer as disruption to train services across the country continued for the fourth consecutive day on Wednesday as the running staff members of the Bangladesh Railway continued their movement for restoration of their previous benefits for working extra hours. On the day, journeys of some local and freight trains remained cancelled to run the intercity passenger trains on the priority basis. Most of the trains ran behind their schedules by one hour to one hour and a half amid huge sufferings of the passengers. Since December 1, the railway staff under the banner of the Bangladesh Railway Running Staff and Sramik Karmachari Samity, stopped doing additional duty except scheduled eight hours and stopped doing duty at rest. The union working president, Saidur Rahman, told New Age on Wednesday that officials of the railway authorities were scheduled to meet them on the day. ‘The meeting was not held as we continued our protest,’ he said, adding that they will continue their movement until their demand is met. According to the railway’s central control office, services of six local trains on the Mymensingh-Mohonganj, Mymensingh- Jharia Jhanjail and Mymensingh-Dewanganj, two trains on the Chattogram-Nazirhat routes and some four to five freight trains remained cancelled. Trains including Joyantika Express on the Dhaka-Sylhet, Rangpur Express on the Dhaka-Rangpur routes and Upakul Express on the Dhaka-Noakhali route were running by one hour and a half to one hour behind their schedules. According to the running staff members, before 2022 since the independence of the country under the Railways Act they got the mileage facility which meant that for every 100 kilometres of train run they received an additional amount of money equivalent to one day’s basic salary. Following this, if a working day is defined by an eight-hour shift, the running staff members work the equivalent of maximum three months of working days in a single month. In 2022, the Finance Division cancelled these facilities for the newly appointed running staff members and the staff members had continued movement since then.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252050/passengers-continue-to-suffer-as-trains-run-late
Regaining voters’ trust top priority,"An exchange of views was held between the newly-formed Election Commission and the Electoral Reform Commission on Wednesday where both parties highlighted the major deficits, including lack of voters’ trust on the electoral system. The newly appointed chief election commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin and the ERC chief Badiul Alam Majumder led their teams in the event held at Nirbachan Bhaban in Dhaka’s Agargaon. After the meeting, election commissioner Abul Fazal Md Sanaullah, also a retired Brigadier General, briefed journalists on behalf of the EC. He said that the meeting highlighted major deficits in the electoral systems including lack of voters’ trust. ‘Both EC and ERC are on the same side. We are determined to organise free and fair elections so that the electoral system regains the voters’ trust,’ Fazal said, adding that the schedule of the next election was not included in the meeting agenda. ERC chief Badiul said they discussed every issue to organise a free, fair and credible election. Faults of the previous ECs, nomination procedure, polling booths, demarcation of constituencies, final voter lists, expatriate voters, postal vote and national identification card were among the prominent issues discussed. ‘The reform commission would submit the recommendation report by this month. Some of our recommendations would be implemented by the EC and the next elected government would implement the rest of them,’ Badiul Alam said, adding that the ERC would seek suggestions from the EC as well to prepare its report. Citing court orders empowering the EC, he also said, ‘The previous ECs failed to hold free and fair elections even the existing laws hugely empower them to do. They must be held accountable.’ Other election commissioners — retired additional secretary Anwarul Islam Sarkar, retired district and sessions judge Abdur Rahmanel Masud, retired joint secretary Begum Tahmida Ahmad — and ERC members Professor Tofail Ahmed, Jasmine Tully, Md Abdul Alim, Zahed Ur Rahman, Mir Nadia Nivin, Md Sadek Ferdous and Sadique Arman were present in the meeting.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252049/regaining-voters-trust-top-priority
Four reforms in power sector can save Tk 138b annually,"Bangladesh can reduce its subsidy burden by Tk 138 billion by making four power sector reforms, said a report released on Wednesday by the US-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. The report also laid out a roadmap implementing which Bangladesh can bring down its current overcapacity of over 60 per cent to nearly zero by 2030. Power consumption in Bangladesh is rising but it failed to keep up with power generation capacity increase, the report said, adding that the rising overcapacity necessitated massive subsidies from the government. ‘The window to make Bangladesh’s power sector sustainable is rapidly narrowing, but there is still time to get the sector back on track by following a suitable roadmap,’ said Shafiqul Alam, the report’s author and also a lead analyst at IEEFA. The report highlights that Bangladesh can achieve the savings by shifting half of the industrial demand, met by captive generators, to the grid, adding 3,000 MW of renewables, reducing load shedding to 5 per cent from the fiscal 2023-24 level and limiting transmission and distribution losses to 8 per cent. The IEEFA report estimated that shifting half the industrial captive power demand to the national grid would save Tk 34.14 billion while the installation of 3000MW renewable capacity, mostly solar, would save Tk 72.71 billion. Minimising transmission and distribution losses and load shedding would save, respectively, Tk 24.44 billion and Tk 6.65 billion. In 2023-24, the government paid Tk 382.89 billion as subsidy to BPDB, the report noted, advising that Bangladesh should gradually shift to electric systems from gas-driven appliances, like boilers, to increase the demand for grid electricity. Alongside this, industries should fully rely on the grid, keeping gas-fired captive generators as backups. These will help increase BPDB’s revenue from selling additional energy while reducing capacity payments to idle plants, the report said. ‘The steps can bring down the subsidy burden to nearly zero,’ said Shafiq. This December the overcapacity is likely to exceed 66 per cent, up from 63.6 per cent recorded in the same month in 2023. The report stated that the BPDB’s total annual expenditure increased 2.6-fold against revenue growth of 1.8 times between FY2019-20 and FY2023-24. The mismatch was made up with the payment of Tk 1,267 billion in subsidy. Yet, the BPDB recorded a cumulative loss of Tk 236.42 billion for the period, the report said. The report advised reviewing the power demand forecast, particularly from 2025 by factoring in energy efficiency gains. IEEFA’s projection by considering such variables shows that the country’s peak power demand in 2030 is likely to be 25,834MW against the Integrated Energy and Power Master Plan’s forecast, made in July 2023, of between 27,138MW and 29,156MW. In October, Bangladesh’s installed generation capacity stood at 27,740MW. The IEEFA roadmap suggests halting investment in fossil fuel-based power and limiting the use of oil-fired plants to 5 per cent of total power generation. If these steps are taken along with the anticipated 4,500MW of fossil-fuel-based power plant retirements, the report expects Bangladesh will have a system capacity of 35,239MW by 2030, enough to meet the demand. Finally, the report said, the country can consider a conservative goal of installing a total combined grid-connected renewable energy capacity of up to 4,500MW by 2030 to help reduce mostly expensive oil-fired power generation during the day. From July 2023 to May 2024, the use of expensive oil-fired plants in meeting peak demand contributed 10.9 per cent of the total power generation, accounting for 32 per cent of fuel expenses.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252048/four-reforms-in-power-sector-can-save-tk-138b-annually
58pc oil used at Rajshahi eateries unhygienic: report,"About fifty-eight per cent edible oils used at different hotels and restaurants in Rajshahi are harmful to human health, according to a report of the Bangladesh Food Safety Authority published on Monday. The national food safety regulatory agency prepared the report by testing foods and oils of 38 hotels and restaurants in the Rajshahi city area and in Puthia and Godagari upazilas in the agency’s Rajshahi mini laboratory in the past month. According the analysis of the report, edible oils of 15 out of 22 hotels and restaurants in the city area, and seven out of sixteen hotels and restaurants in Puthia and Godagari upazilas contain excessive amount (above 24 per cent) of polar compounds, harmful substances that are formed due to reusing edible oils used in frying again and again. Besides, the agency has found various harmful microorganisms by testing the chopping and serving tables of some of the hotels and restaurants. ‘We have seized and destroyed the edible oils in which total polar compounds are found in excessive amounts,’ said Md Yeamin Hossain, food safety officer of Bangladesh Food Safety Authority Rajshahi office. He said that the hotels and the restaurants were not fined but were asked to use fresh edible oils. Professor Mahbubur Rahman Khan Badsha, head of Rajshahi Medical College’s medicine department, said that consuming food prepared with edible oils containing excessive amounts of polar compounds was very harmful to human health. ‘They can cause inflammation, resulting in ulcer and stomach cancer. Besides, it can cause liver and digestive problems as well as infecting kidney and gallbladder problems,’ he said. Professor Mahbubur said that the government should increase awareness among the owners and staff members of the hotels and restaurants so that they did not reuse the same oil several times. ‘Along with raising awareness, the government should also bring those responsible for using unhygienic oils in cooking to book,’ he added.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252047/58pc-oil-used-at-rajshahi-eateries-unhygienic-report
Babul Akhter released on bail in wife murder case,"Former superintendent of police, Babul Akhter, was released on Wednesday from Chattogram Central Jail after 43 months of imprisonment in connection with the murder of his wife, Mahmuda Khanam Mitu. The release followed a decision by the Appellate Division’s chamber judge to uphold a High Court order granting him bail. Babul’s lawyer, Kafil Uddin, and his second wife received him at the jail gate. On June 5, 2016, Mahmuda was shot dead while dropping off her son at a school bus stop in the city’s GEC area. Initially, Babul Akhter himself filed a murder case against unidentified assailants with Panchlaish police station. The case, however, took a dramatic turn when Mitu’s father, Mosharraf Hossain, accused Babul of orchestrating the murder and filed a separate case against him. On May 12, 2021, Babul was arrested as prime suspect in the case. Over the years, his bail applications were consistently denied until November 27, 2024, when the HC granted him bail following the fall of the Awami League government after a student-led mass uprising on August 5. Mosharraf Hossain, acting independently of the government, filed an appeal to the Appellate Division challenging Babul’s bail order. The court, however, upheld the High Court’s decision, clearing the way for Babul’s release. Babul was granted bail while third additional metropolitan sessions judge at Chattogram testified 50 out of 90 prosecution witnesses of the murder case.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252046/babul-akhter-released-on-bail-in-wife-murder-case

Businessman killed at home in Dhaka,"The police recovered the body of a trader from his rented house in the Posta area in the capital’s Old town early Wednesday. The trader’s hands, feet and face were tied. The victim is Nazrul Islam, 52, owner of Nazrul Engineering Workshop at Lalbagh, and son of Shamsul Haque, a resident of Belabo upazila in Narsingdi.

HC to fix date for verdict today,"The High Court is scheduled for today to fix a date for its verdict on two writ petitions challenging the constitutionality of the 15th amendment to the constitution that scrapped the election-time caretaker government system in 2011 during the Awami League rule. The bench of Justice Farah Mahbub and Justice Debasish Roy Chowdhury made the announcement on Wednesday after concluding the final hearing on the two writ petitions. Former attorney general Fida M Kamal, appearing for a petition filed by freedom fighter Mofazzal Hossain from Naogaon, advocated for reinstating the referendum mechanism to ensure the alignment of any amendment to the constitution with the will of the people. The petition challenged the legality of several provisions introduced through the 15th amendment that abolished the caretaker government system and declared certain constitutional provisions unamendable. Earlier on August 19, 2024, another High Court bench issued a rule questioning the legality of the 15th amendment. The rule was issued following a writ petition filed by five eminent citizens, including prominent citizens such as Sushashoner Jonno Nagorik president M Hafizuddin Khan, its founding secretary Badiul Alam Majumder and local government expert Tofail Ahmed. Their lawyer Sharif Bhuiyan argued for scrapping the 15 amendment to the constitution in its entirety. Several political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and the Gana Forum, and some individuals also challenged the 15th amendment as interveners and called for greater democratic accountability. They argued that the 15th amendment strategically undermined democratic principles by consolidating power and eliminating checks and balances between the powers of the three state organs. Fida M Kamal criticised the 15th amendment, particularly the inclusion of article 7B, which rendered certain constitutional provisions unamendable. He argued that the article undermined the constitution’s fluidity and adaptability likening it to rigid religious texts. ‘Article 7B imposes undue restrictions on future parliaments, violating the principle that the constitution is a living document meant to evolve with societal needs’ Fida contended. ‘No parliament has the authority to bind its successors or predecessors in this manner,’ he said. Article 7 of the constitution, which declares that all powers of the republic belong to the people, has been effectively nullified by the removal of the referendum mechanism, contended the senior lawyer. Fida underscored the importance of restoring the referendum system, arguing that it would ensure participatory democracy by subjecting major constitutional amendments to public approval. He also called for reforms to article 70, which prevents lawmakers from voting against their party in parliamentary proceedings. He said, ‘Article 70 stifles individual decision-making and meaningful parliamentary debate, undermining the essence of democracy. A reformed provision would strengthen the parliamentary system and enhance accountability.’ Earlier, attorney general Md Asaduzzaman argued for retaining certain aspects of the 15th amendment, including article 2A, which ensured equal rights for all faiths while designating Islam as the state religion. He criticised the 15th amendment for attempting to entrench an authoritarian framework, enabling indefinite retention of power by the ruling party. He emphasised that the Appellate Division had already clarified issues related to judicial appointments and accountability in its verdict on the 16th amendment to the constitution. Fida M Kamal reiterated that parliament, as a creation of the constitution, must operate within its confines. ‘Parliament in Bangladesh is not sovereign like the British parliament,’ he said. ‘Legislation that contradicts the fundamental will of the people or violates constitutional principles should be declared invalid,’ he argued.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252042/hc-to-fix-date-for-verdict-today
Gunman held after failed attack on Sikh leader in India,"A gunman who attempted to shoot a Sikh political leader at the faith’s holiest shrine in India was arrested on Wednesday after the thwarted attack, police said. The assailant entered the Golden Temple in northwestern Amritsar city as a visitor and attempted to shoot Sukhbir Singh Badal, the president of a Sikh political party. Badal’s security tackled the gunman after he took his weapon from his waist and the sole shot he fired off missed its target, instead hitting a marble pillar. ‘Security of Sukhbir Singh Badal has been tightened. The assailant is in police custody and investigation is in process,’ senior Punjab state police officer Harpal Singh told reporters. Badal, 62, was at the temple to serve a punishment imposed by the faith’s hierarchy for alleged ‘mistakes’ committed while his party was governing Punjab state in the decade up to 2017. He had been ordered to sit at the Golden Temple’s entrance holding a spear since the beginning of the week as an act of contrition. The Golden Temple — a gleaming structure in a large artificial pond, revered by Sikhs the world over — has been the scene of violence in the past. Indian special forces stormed it in 1984 to remove Sikh militants that had barricaded themselves inside during an insurgency demanding an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India. Hundreds were killed, many of them civilians, when the army stormed the temple, and outraged Sikhs accused soldiers of religious desecration. In the aftermath later that year, then prime minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards, leading to brutal reprisals that killed thousands of Sikhs around India.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/252041/gunman-held-after-failed-attack-on-sikh-leader-in-india
12 followers of Chinmoy remanded,"The Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court in Chattogram on Wednesday allowed the police to take 12 followers of expelled ISKCON organiser Chinmoy Krishna Das in custody for interrogation in the case of assaulting police and obstructing them from discharging their duties. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Hasan Shahriar passed the order in the morning, said Mofizur Rahman, additional deputy commissioner (prosecution) of Chattogram Metropolitan Police. The accused are Aman Das, Rumit Das, Nayan Das, Gagan Das, Sumit Das, Bishal Das, Sonu Das, Sumon Das, Rajesh Das, Durlav Das, Joy Nath, and Ajay Sutradhar Chowdhury. ADC Mofizur Rahman said, ‘The accused were produced before the court in a case filed by Kotwali Police Station. Although a seven-day remand was sought, the court approved a six-day remand following a hearing.’ Meanwhile, another case has been filed in connection with the recent clash between police and supporters of Chinmoy in the Chattogram court area. The case named 29 individuals, identifying them as leaders and activists of the banned Chhatra League, Juba League, Swechchhasebak League, Awami League, and ISKCON. Additionally, 40 to 50 unidentified individuals have been implicated. Businessman Mohammad Ullah Chowdhury, a resident of the Khulshi area, lodged the complaint on Tuesday evening with the Kotwali police station, said Kazi Md Tarek Aziz, Additional Deputy Commissioner of CMP. He said, in the newly filed case, 29 individuals, including two former ward councilors, have been named as accused. Earlier on Monday, the court had approved a seven-day remand for eight other suspects in a separate case involving an attack on police personnel. On November 26, the Sixth Metropolitan Magistrate Court of Chattogram rejected Chinmoy’s bail petition in a sedition case and ordered him to be sent to jail. Saiful Islam Alif, a Chattogram court member, was stabbed indiscriminately during the clash between law enforcement agencies and followers of Chinmoy on the day. With latest one, six cases were filed so far over Saiful Islam Alif’s killing near court premises and vandalism and other offences. The police have filed three of the cases and victim families filed the rest two, while 38 people have been arrested in connection with Saiful killing.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252040/12-followers-of-chinmoy-remanded
Tarique urges party activists to avoid controversial activities,"BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman on Wednesday asked his party leaders and activists to refrain from any negative or controversial activities that may undermine the public confidence as the next general election would be ‘very tough’ for the party. ‘Let’s come to take an oath that we will refrain from doing anything that undermines the public confidence (in BNP),’ he said, while addressing a workshop in Chattogram through a virtual platform. BNP Training Affair Committee arranged the Chattorgam Divisional workshop titled ‘31-point state structure reform proposal and the public engagement’ at Chattogram Engineers’ Institute. Tarique said, ‘If anyone thinks those whom we considered our main political opponents are not there or they are now weak in the field and we would go to power easily, please remove it (this thought) from the mind.’ He said the next election will be very tough for his party as many conspiracies continue and many invisible forces are working against BNP. The BNP acting chairman said BNP leaders and activists had to tolerate numerous torture and repression for the last 15-16 years. ‘Please don’t spoil our achievements and sacrifices with small mistakes. We should be conscious so that our achievements and sacrifices are not foiled,’ he said. He said BNP won’t be able to woo voters in the next election if it fails to keep up the existing public trust in the party. ‘We’ll have to keep up the existing public confidence. Otherwise, you won’t gain the votes of people. It is not the responsibility of people to retain this confidence, rather it’s yours (BNP representatives) duty,’ he added. ‘You will have to uphold this confidence until the vote is held. And when you win the election, you will have to work to implement the 31-point reform proposal,’ said Tarique. The BNP leader asked his party leaders and activists to take its 31-point reform proposal to the doors of people and to drum up support for it.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/252039/tarique-urges-party-activists-to-avoid-controversial-activities
Trade with India not to be affected: Salehuddin,"Finance adviser Salehuddin Ahmed on Wednesday said the ongoing political development between Bangladesh and India would not adversely impact trades between the two countries. Politics should not matter on trade and commercial issues, he said while responding to a question after a meeting of the cabinet committee on government purchase at the secretariat which approved importing rice from India and Myanmar. The meeting, chaired by the finance adviser, held a day after Bangladesh mission at Agartala in India was closed on security ground on Tuesday while Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Verma was summoned on the same day by the foreign ministry in Dhaka over the ‘heinous attack’ on its mission in Agartala. Mondol Stone Products Pvt Limited of West Bengal in India won an open tender to supply 50,000 tonnes non-Basmati with per tonne costing $467 while Myanmar Rice Foundation will supply 1 lakh tonnes Atap under the government-to-government arrangement with per tonne costing $515. The finance adviser said the government would purchase quality goods from the suppliers from any country be it India or other countries. Informing that the government is also discussing with Vietnam to import rice, Salehuddin Ahmed said the politics had no place in trades. Asked to make comments on threats by politicians in West Bengal to suspend trade through Benapole land port, the finance adviser said he would not show any extreme reactions. The India businesses will protest at such threats since they export surplus agriculture outputs, said the finance adviser. The finance adviser said the commodity market was giving signs of stability and hoped that price hikes of commodity would be checked in coming days. The commodity prices will remain at comfortable level in the upcoming Ramadan, he hoped. Once again asking the country people to be patient, he said the government was trying to increase the import of edible oil, price of which increased in the international market recently. The cabinet committee on government purchase also approved procurement of 60,000 tonnes of fertiliser, 30,000 tonnes of rock phosphate and 5,000 tonnes sugar. Under a local open tender, City Sugar Industries Ltd Dhaka will supply the sugar with per kg sugar costing Tk 118.43 to Trading Corporation Bangladesh. Besides, the TCB will also procure 10,000 tonnes of lentil under a local open tender from Payel Traders, Chattogram with per kilogramme costing Tk 96.69. The finance adviser also presided over a meeting on the cabinet committee on economic affairs on the same day and agreed in principle to buy Essential Programme on Immunisation vaccines directly through UNICEF under the Expanded Programme on Immunisation.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/bangladesh/252038/trade-with-india-not-to-be-affected-salehuddin
Dhaka wants reciprocal relations with Delhi: Touhid,"Foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain on Wednesday said Bangladesh wants good relations with India on a reciprocal basis, hinting that Foreign Office Consultations between the two countries might take place a day ahead instead of December 10. ‘It is very clear that we want good relations but it should be reciprocal. We need to work to that end,’ he told reporters while responding to a question at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Asked about the FOC, Hossain said it may take place one day ahead of the schedule, or it will be held on December 10 in Dhaka. Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri is likely to be in Dhaka on December 9 or 10 accordingly as both Bangladesh and India are preparing for the Foreign Secretary-level meeting. Once finalised, this is going to be the first visit to be paid by a senior Indian government official to Bangladesh since the interim government, led by Nobel laureate Prof Muhammad Yunus, came to power in August 8, a diplomatic source told UNB on Wednesday. However, there has been no official announcement yet regarding his visit to hold the Foreign Office Consultations with Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Md Jashim Uddin. The discussion is likely to cover a range of bilateral issues, including the potential extradition of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who is currently in India and visa issues. At the foreign ministry’s weekly briefing on November 21, director general of the Public Diplomacy Wing Toufique Hasan confirmed that an inter-ministerial meeting has already taken place to coordinate preparations for the upcoming talks. ‘There is a scope for discussion on the matter (extradition of Sheikh Hasina),’ Hasan said at a weekly media briefing. Sheikh Hasina, who fled Dhaka on August 5 and has been residing in India since then, is facing trial in Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal for alleged involvement in mass killings during the July-August uprising. While the government intends to bring her back, Hasan emphasised that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received any formal directive to initiate the extradition process. ‘We will engage with Delhi and begin the formal process in accordance with the existing extradition treaty once we receive the necessary instructions,’ he clarified in response to queries. Regarding the review of existing agreements and memorandums of understanding (MoUs) between the two countries, Hasan said that these fall under the jurisdiction of various ministries in Bangladesh.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/252037/dhaka-wants-reciprocal-relations-with-delhi-touhid
Indian flag trampling photo AI-generated,"The viral photo which showed a man, in panjabi, pajama and tupi carrying a Bangladeshi flag, stepping on an Indian flag was AI-generated, reported Rumour Scanner on Wednesday. The image was spread by Indian media and social media users. Rumour Scanner could not locate a credible source of the photograph, which only exists on social media and was first shared from an X account titled Voice of Bangladeshi Hindus on December 1. No national media, however, reported the matter. Rumour Scanner found that a finger on the right foot of the person was abnormally short, the pajama he was wearing looked similar to a dhoti, and there also existed inconsistencies in the fold on the red circle on the Bangladesh flag in the photo. Besides, the reflection of light, shadows, and eye expressions of the person appear unusual. Such inconsistencies usually appear in AI-generated photos. Besides, truemedia.org also found evidence supporting the fact that it is a manipulated image.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/252036/indian-flag-trampling-photo-ai-generated
AL leader Tofail sued,"A case has been filed against veteran Awami League leader Tofail Ahmed and 85 others over allegations of foiling a Bangladesh Nationalist Party rally, opening fire and vandalising district the party office in the Bhola town in 2019. Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal Bhola district unit leader Md Arif Hossain filed the case with the Bhola Sadar police station on Monday, said the police station officer-in-charge, Abu Shahadat Md Hussain Parvez. ‘It is the first case where Tofail Ahmed has been made the prime accused after the students-led mass uprising that overthrew the Sheikh Hasina-led regime on August 5. He is also accused in a case over attacking former BNP Bhola-2 lawmaker Hafiz Ibrahim,’ the OC said, adding that all witnesses in the case are BNP leaders as they were victims. He said that none was arrested so far in the case. Tofail is an AL advisory council member. Tofail served as the industry and commerce minister of the AL government from 1996 to 2001 and he also served as a commerce minister after the 2014 general election. Tofail Ahmed was elected as a lawmaker several times from Bhola 1 and Bhola 2 constituencies. According to the case statement, the other accused in the case include former AL Bhola 2 lawmaker Ali Azam Mukul, former AL Bhola 3 lawmaker Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shawon and former AL government deputy minister and Bhola 4 lawmaker Abdullah Al Islam Jakob, former AL Bhola district unit general secretary Mainul Hossain Biplab and former Bhola Sadar municipality mayor Moniruzzaman Monir. On May 3, 2019, Bhola district unit BNP organised a rally in front of its party office at Mohajanpatti in the town demanding release of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and reduction in prices of essential commodities. A meeting was held in the Tofail Ahmed’s house to foil the rally and the other accused executed the plan by opening fire with shotguns and vandalizing the party office, the case statement added. Meanwhile, a Dhaka magistrate court on Wednesday showed nine people, including former ministers Anisul Huq, Hasanul Haque Inu, Rashed Khan Menon, and Zunaid Ahmed Palak, arrested in five fresh cases filed with three different police stations in Dhaka. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Md Imran Ahmed passed the order after investigation officers in the cases produced them before the court with petitions to show them arrested in the cases.

BTRC rejects proposal,"The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission has refused a proposal to provide transit for bandwidth to India through Bangladesh as the transit might weaken Bangladesh’s role as a regional digital hub. The BTRC issued a letter in this regard on December 1. International terrestrial cable operators ‘Summit Communications’ and ‘Fiber at Home’ submitted an application during the former Awami Legue government to the BTRC for its approval to permit Bharti Airtel Limited to run a transit connection from Akhaura border to Singapore by establishing an internet circuit at Akhaura border. A terrestrial cable is a communications cable which crosses land, rather than water. Contacted, several BTRC officials denied commenting on the matter. They, however, said that the transit would offer minimal benefits to Bangladesh. The primary beneficiaries would have been Summit Communications and Fiber at Home, which were allegedly connected with the deposed Awami League government. The actual advantage would have gone to India. Bharti Airtel submitted the proposal to Bangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The ministry then forwarded it to the Post and Telecommunication Division and then to BTRC for evaluation. According to a letter issued by the engineering and operations division of the commission on December 1, the BTRC decided not to approve the application after reviewing it. Content delivery networks, such as Google, Meta, Akamai, and Amazon might be discouraged to establish their data centres in Bangladesh, if the International Private Leased Circuit transit connection is approved, the letter said. This kind of connection will weaken Bangladesh’s position as a regional digital hub, it said. ‘The capacity of the submarine cables will increase in the future. If this transit proposal is approved, it might decrease the chance to export bandwidth to the neighbouring countries by using the capacity of those submarine cables,’ it added. International terrestrial cable operators supply 60 per cent of the international bandwidth used in the country, Bangladesh Submarine Cables PLC supplies the remaining 40 per cent. Despite having usage capacity of 7,217 Gbps, the company’s bandwidth usage is only 2,343 Gbps currently. Bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over an internet connection in a given time. Higher bandwidth means faster downloads, smoother streaming, and better overall performance, making it crucial for handling modern internet activities and multiple devices. ‘If such connections are provided in favour of ITC operators, it will disrupt making the huge quantity of unused bandwidth of the BSCPLC usable,’ the letter further said. India currently enjoys road transits through Bangladesh by four transhipment routes for Indian traders in Tripura and other north-eastern states, and a rail transit to carry goods and passengers across its territory.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/telecom/252034/btrc-rejects-proposal
500 arrested in Chennai,"The police in Chennai of India arrested 500 people, including 100 women, from BJP, RSS, ABVP, Hindu Munnani, and other Hindu organisations on Wednesday for staging a protest, demanding safety of Hindus in Bangladesh in front of the Raja Rathinam Stadium, reports timesofindia.indiatimes.com. The protest was led by Hindu Munnani organizer Raju.

Countrywide protests on,"Different political parties, student bodies and lawyer organisations protested at the attack on the Bangladesh assistant high commission in India’s Agartala for the third consecutive day on Wednesday in the country. The attack on the Bangladesh mission in Agartala was launched by a group of Indian protesters on Monday afternoon, pressing for the release of Hindu community leader in Bangladesh Chinmoy Krishna Das, now in jail in a sedition case. Addressing a pre-procession rally organised by Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Front in front of the National Press Club on Wednesday, BNP senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvy urged people from all walks of life for a coordinated movement breaking the ‘slavery of Delhi’. ‘India could not accept the fall of Sheikh Hasina. India is opposing the mass uprising at a time when concerned citizens across the globe could not hold their tears after seeing the sacrifices of thousand people, including Aby Sayeed, Mugdho during the July uprising,’ said Rizvy. He said that the country achieved independence no to be a slave of India. He also slammed the Indian media outlets for spreading false propagandas about Bangladesh. Accusing the West Bengal’s chief minister Mamata Banerjee of harbouring deep-seated Hindu nationalist views, Rizvy said, ‘Although Mamata publicly advocates for secularism, she cherishes extremist Hindu nationalist beliefs. She has allied herself with the communal BJP government. This alignment undermines her professed secular values.’ Leaders of Left Democratic Alliance on Wednesday at a protest rally in front of the National Press Club demanded punishments of attackers on Bangladesh mission in Agartala. Coordinator of the alliance Masud Rana, also coordinator of Socialist Party of Bangladesh (Marxist), chaired the rally. He condemned the attack and demanded punishment for the attackers. Communist Party of Bangladesh general secretary Ruhin Hossain Prince, SPB general secretary Bazlur Rashid Firoz, Revolutionary Communist League central leader Abdus Satter, Democratic Revolutionary Party general secretary Mushrefa Mishu and others spoke at the rally. The rally was followed by a procession that paraded different city roads. ‘Anti-Discrimination Students and People’ on Wednesday evening held a protest rally and brought out a procession condemning the terrorist attack on the Bangladesh mission in Agartala, New Age correspondent in DU reported. They also demanded the arrest and trial of the attackers, and protested against the arrogant remarks of Indian political leaders regarding Bangladesh. Addressing the rally at the base of the Anti-Terrorism Raju Memorial Sculpture on the Dhaka University campus, former student leader Abu Hanif, one of the organisers of the platform, said that according to the Vienna Convention, it is not permissible to attack an embassy. ‘The attack on the Bangladesh assistant high commission is a threat to our sovereignty,’ he added.

Parasite: a critique of capitalism,"PARASITE, directed by Bong Joon Ho in 2019, had been critically acclaimed as one of the most effectual cinematic commentaries on modern society and hailed as one of the best films of the 21st century. With an airy balance of dark humour, suspense, and sharp-eyed social critique, Bong launches a scathing attack on the ideology of capitalism, fuelling those self-perpetuating cycles of exploitation, resentment, and dehumanisation that structural economic inequality creates. The movie tells a serendipitous story of the entanglement between two families: the rich Parks and the poor Kims — entwined in circumstances, yet divided by an insurmountable barrier of class. With layered storytelling and vast attention to detail, Parasite debunks the myth of social mobility, pointing out structures that impede the working class from ever being pulled out of their perpetual marginalization. Setting, imagery, and the psychological toll wrought by economic disparity — these things come across as an unflinchingly honest look at a society where the working class exists only to support and reinforce the lives of those privileged. Parasite isn’t a movie; it’s a cultural phenomenon. It was a violently honest illustration of class struggle and systemic inequality that the viewer was forced to confront. The universal theme resonates across cultures and borders; hence it is timeless; it will outlive film as an expression medium. Parasite bears a powerful message on the unsustainable dynamics of dependency and division, cultivated by capitalism, told through bold storytelling and incisive critique. This essay explores class conflict through the prism of Bong’s visionary work through, among other things, the use of physical space, symbolism, character dynamics, and cinematographic technique to underscore the injustices innate in the capitalist system.  Class hierarchy and spatial division THE spatial geometry in Parasite, therefore, spells out the deep-seated divisions of class in capitalist societies. The Kim family lives in a semi-basement apartment that reflects their position in society — on the margins, neither submerged into poverty nor elevated into affluence. It is a small, dark space, semi-subterranean by nature, to illustrate their limited view on life outside their class. While they are able to see the outside world through the small window, this is the extent of their social location constraint. Bong drives this message of division home through the catastrophic rainstorm that floods their home, washing away their few belongings and obliging them to find shelter in a hot, steamy public gymnasium. This is, of course, also symbolic of the precarious existence that capitalism lays upon the working class, whereby even minimal disruption will result in disaster. In contrast, the hilltop mansion belonging to the Park family becomes a symbol of wealth and privilege. This place-developed architecture with open spaces, natural light, and modern aesthetics represents all those securities and comforts that money affords. The Parks are physically and metaphorically separated from the struggles of the working class. This division is furthered by the movie’s recurring use of stairways: the Kims have to go upstairs to get to the Parks’ house but then also down to the subterranean areas of both their own semi-basement or the bunker hidden in the Parks’ house. As Timothy Corrigan duly observes, Bong mobilises here verticality to stress ‘spatially insurmountable barriers between rich and poor, reflecting the rigidity of class structures’ (Corrigan 89). These spatial juxtapositions critique the ideal of social mobility in capitalism; it is to say, the system is designed that way to keep working-class citizens at the bottom and never able to escape the bonds of their socioeconomic status.  Symbolism and the dehumanising effects of wealth BONG uses symbolism to expose psychological and emotional distance between classes. Perhaps one of the more obvious themes of Parasite is that of ‘smell.’ Mr Park constantly remarks on the smell of the Kim family, how it is just so repulsive and unique. In one instance, he mentions to his wife that Mr Kim smells ‘like a subway,’ or something definitely recognisable and lower class. This reveals how the upper class truly sees the working class as less and grimier. Smell becomes an invisible yet potent marker of class difference, symbolising the Kims’ inability to transcend their socioeconomic status, no matter how convincingly they mimic the Parks’ behaviours. Christopher Bell argues that this trope demonstrates how capitalist societies impose intangible but powerful markers of class distinction on the working class (Bell 112). The disgust of the Parks towards the smell of the Kims is one not of hygiene but rather of the deeper underlying dehumanisation of the poor. By reducing the Kims down to their smell, Mr Park dehumanises them, reinforcing the psychological divide that exists between classes. Dehumanisation like this creates resentment in the Kims, especially in Ki-taek, whose eventual outbreak in violence reveals the breaking point of the oppressed. The storm also works as a strong metaphor for the indiscrimination of capitalism. For the Parks, it is little more than a minor nuisance that postpones a garden party. For the Kims, on the other hand, it is the bringing of devastation upon their makeshift home and forcing them into further despair. This scene ‘exposes the precarity of the working class, whereby even a minor natural event can have disastrous effects’ (Lewis 67). Using the storm as a metaphor, Bong shows the inequities of capitalism — where the poor are helpless against forces beyond their control and the rich sit in a bubble without a thought to such inconveniences. This juxtaposition visually and narratively critiques a system that prioritises, at all costs, comfort for the privileged over the survival of the underprivileged.  Character dynamics and the fiction of social class mobility THE dynamic nature of the relationship between the Kim and Park families shows that social mobility in a capitalist society is a delusion. Initial infiltration of the park household by the Kims illustrates a determination to rise above class status. By hijacking jobs with the Parks, the Kims fleetingly get to enjoy the trappings of success. The success they realise, however, is predicated on a lie; it speaks volumes regarding the nonexistent avenues available and/or legitimate for poor people to climb the social ladder. Their threat of being found out is represented in a wonderfully tense scene where they all crouch under the Parks’ living room table, revealing how precarious their position is. They are aliens who cannot be completely assimilated into the world of the rich and affluent. These psychological burdens most vividly come to the forefront through Ki-taek. The consistently critical comments Mr Park makes about his smell, as well as his careless indifference to working-class struggle, slowly strip Ki-take of dignity. This anger bursts into a violent action during the climax of the movie and blasts the illusory harmony between the two families. According to Sarah Lewis, ‘The outburst by Ki-taek is the internalised frustrations of the working class, which, when left unaddressed, erupt in confrontation’ (Lewis 67). Bong indicates that not only does capitalism perpetuate inequality, but it creates an environment in which resentment and violence are inevitable. The desperation inherent in the pursuit of financial security is also underscored by how the Kims have incrementally infiltrated the Park household, having displaced the Parks’ original staff. The Kims’ deception and willingness to exploit others in similar socioeconomic positions reflect the pressures that capitalism places on the working class to compete for survival. This dynamic underline class division between the working class and the rich, showing how a capitalist system even pits poor people against each other for limited opportunities.  Dependency and exploitation in capitalism PARASITE critiques exploitative relationships that are at the foundation of capitalist systems by driving home the point about mutual dependency between rich and working-class counterparts. Instead of recognising the Kims as human individuals, the Parks use them as labourers to help sustain the ‘lifestyle’ to which they have become accustomed. Conversely, the Kims rely on the Parks for economic survival. The contingency the Kims face with the Parks puts them in a so-called submissive position that denies the family agency. This sets up a self-perpetuating cycle in which neither family is ever free. Therefore, the Kims are at the mercy of the Parks’ goodwill since it is filling their need and belonging, and any economic dependence within a capitalist society may be precarious. According to Peter Kim, Bong shows this dynamic as ‘the ultimate danger of the capitalist structure, where both the oppressed and oppressors are caught in a system where resentment, exploitation, and violence become self-perpetuating’ (Kim 54). The violent ending to the film represents this cycle that destabilises a society. Ki-teak’s killing of Mr Park, therefore, represents not only revenge but also a symbolic renunciation of a system that dehumanises both families. The inherent critique by Bong insists that capitalism cannot survive; through making groups vulnerable to conflict and collapse, such developments cannot endure. The denouement of the movie, with sudden outbreaks of violence, insinuates that these tensions, if unresolved, may have disastrous effects on individuals and society in general.  Technical elements and cinematic language CINEMATIC technique is used by Bong Joon Ho in order to emphasise the critique of capitalism in the movie. It can be noticed in the visual design of the homes of the two families: the poor Kims lived in a cluttered semi-basement, whereas the rich Parks lived in a spacious mansion. All of these points are well-supported and quite relevant to the plot of the film. Other symbolism involved the staircases that connected the main floors of the mansion to the basement level; often, the camera would fixate on the physical rise and fall of the Kims. Such movements symbolically betrayed their fussy efforts to escape poverty. At the same time, editing underlines the main themes of the film. For example, cross-cutting during salient moments, like the rainstorm sequence, puts together both families and serves to underscore the experiences of both, making a statement on the inequities of their lives. Bong pays great attention to minute detail — from the placement of objects in the Park home to the framing of characters in confined spaces — creating a visual language that underscores the ideological message of the film. As Linda Williams observes, ‘Bong’s use of architecture and framing mirrors the physical and ideological separation of the classes under capitalism’ (Williams 44). Such attention to craft means that the film’s message of critique operates both narratively and aesthetically for the benefit of its viewers, who are then enveloped in the visual and emotional topography of class division. The movie Parasite strongly condemns the system that nurtures class inequality. Bong Joon Ho points out, through this juxtaposition of physical spaces and with strong symbolism, how the psychological consequences of economic inequality arise and how capitalism is maintained through cycles of dependence, exploitation, and dehumanization. There are layers within the movie’s narrative, while there is precision in technique that defies the viewer to consider the feasibility of such a society on the basis of huge inequities. Ultimately, Parasite pushes audiences to fantasise about a different kind of future, one where dignity and security are within the grasp of the many and not limited to the few who earn their status. The meaning of this movie extends much farther than its fantasy world, as it leaves viewers to reflect on real-world, deep-seated societal structures that limit. Parasite, a film by Bong Joon Ho, is a real powerhouse in critiquing capitalism by showing how this deep systemic inequality entraps the poor while raising privileged few. The movie challenges the very myth of social mobility through the contrast in the lives of the Kims and Parks. The luxurious mansion of the Parks heaves its great view, while that of the Kims is a cramped basement apartment, representing how insurmountably far apart classes are. The recurring motif of stairs endorses the lie of upward mobility; it shows that often, forced measures — like deception for mere survival — are the only hope of the lower class. As the story unfolds, the Kims infiltration into the Parks’ lives reveals a kind of moral blindness among the rich, while the mayhem that erupts in the film’s climax reveals the brutal consequences of inequality. In that sense, Parasite soars beyond its narrative into a sharp, unsettling contemplation of the social and economic order that perpetuates injustice and calls on the viewer to reimagine another system that separates us and to dream of a better future.

Vision rooted in pragmatism and peace Future Bangladesh,"BANGLADESH, with its rich history of resilience, vibrant culture, and untapped potential, stands at a crossroads. To earn respect on the global stage, the nation must channel its energies toward development, innovation, and peaceful engagement. While external tensions and internal challenges exist, Bangladesh’s path to global admiration lies not in confrontation but in pragmatic nation-building. By focusing on science, education, economic diversification, and inclusive governance, and by drawing lessons from global success stories tailored to its unique context, Bangladesh can rise as a respected voice in the world.  Importance of pragmatism in global relations BANGLADESH’S geopolitical position, bordered by India, Myanmar, and the Bay of Bengal, places it in a region of strategic importance but also exposes it to external tensions. Hostile attitudes, perceived or real, from neighbouring nations can create friction. However, history shows that nations gain more by focusing inward on development than outward on rivalry. Bangladesh should adopt a pragmatic approach, using diplomacy to manage external relations while concentrating on strengthening its foundations. Take a couple of global examples. After a devastating war, Vietnam pivoted to economic reform through its Doi Moi policy, transforming itself into one of Asia’s fastest-growing economies while maintaining amicable relations with larger powers. Despite limited resources and historical tensions with neighbouring Malaysia, Singapore prioritised economic growth, stability, and global trade, emerging as a respected international hub. Bangladesh must similarly prioritise growth and development while fostering constructive dialogue with neighbours. Agreements on trade, water sharing, and regional connectivity should be pursued as avenues for collaboration, not conflict.  Investing in science, technology, and education A NATION’S global standing is often tied to its contributions to innovation and knowledge. Bangladesh must accelerate investment in science, technology, and education to develop a skilled workforce capable of addressing modern challenges. As such, education reform is of paramount importance. Emphasising science, technology, engineering, and mathematics is critical for fostering innovation. Bangladesh’s universities should align curricula with global industry demands, preparing graduates for roles in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and renewable energy. Beyond higher education, robust programs in technical training can empower millions of workers to contribute meaningfully to the economy. There are many examples of such transformation on the world stage. Post-war South Korea invested heavily in education and innovation, nurturing a knowledge-based economy. Companies like Samsung and Hyundai are now global leaders. India’s focus on information technology education turned it into the world’s IT outsourcing hub, a model Bangladesh could emulate. Bangladesh must also address challenges in its education system, such as high dropout rates and inequitable access, particularly for rural and marginalised communities.  Embracing economic diversification WHILE Bangladesh’s garment industry is a global leader, over-reliance on this sector poses risks. Diversifying the economy is crucial for long-term stability and respect. There are several potential growth sectors. Leveraging its young, tech-savvy population, Bangladesh can expand its IT and outsourcing industries. As a nation vulnerable to climate change, Bangladesh can lead in renewable energy, particularly solar and wind power. Domestic innovation in this sector could serve as a global model. Modernising agriculture with technology and diversifying exports (e.g., organic products, aquaculture) could significantly boost the economy. Vietnam diversified beyond textiles into electronics manufacturing and agriculture. Bangladesh can follow a similar trajectory by encouraging foreign direct investment and creating export-friendly policies.  Addressing domestic challenges TO BUILD global respect, Bangladesh must confront its internal challenges with transparency and determination. One of the core challenges is bringing political stability. Frequent political unrest and partisanship can undermine development. A stable, inclusive governance model is essential for sustained growth. Bangladesh can learn from countries like Indonesia, which transitioned from political instability to a robust democracy while maintaining steady economic growth. Corruption and bureaucracy are other prime challenges. Corruption remains a significant obstacle to foreign investment and domestic progress. Streamlining bureaucracy and ensuring accountability through technology and independent oversight can foster trust in institutions. We also need to focus on infrastructure development. Modernising transportation, energy, and communication infrastructure is critical for attracting investment and improving quality of life. Large-scale projects like the Padma Bridge showcase potential but must be complemented by efficient urban planning and smart city initiatives.  Balancing religion and progress RELIGION is a core part of Bangladesh’s identity, with Islam deeply embedded in its culture. However, the country must balance religious values with inclusivity and modernity. Overemphasis on reactionary or rigid interpretations can create divisions and hinder progress. There are lessons from other nations that we can translate for our needs. Malaysia balances Islamic values with a modern, multicultural society, leveraging its diversity for economic growth and social harmony. The UAE and Qatar integrate Islamic traditions with cutting-edge modernisation, creating global hubs of business and culture. Bangladesh should emphasise the peaceful and progressive aspects of Islam, which encourage education, innovation, and compassion. Initiatives promoting interfaith dialogue and inclusive governance can prevent societal polarisation.  Leveraging the Bangladeshi diaspora THE Bangladeshi diaspora is a powerful but underutilised asset. Millions of expatriates contribute billions in remittances, but their potential goes beyond financial support. There are some practical ways to engage the diaspora. Encourage skilled expatriates to return temporarily or virtually contribute their expertise in technology, healthcare, and education. Create incentives for diaspora members to invest in Bangladesh’s startups and infrastructure projects. Empower diaspora communities to act as cultural ambassadors, promoting Bangladesh’s heritage and achievements.  Taking climate leadership BANGLADESH is one of the most climate-vulnerable nations in the world, yet it has shown resilience in adapting to environmental challenges. By scaling these efforts, Bangladesh can position itself as a global leader in climate action. We can think of various innovative solutions: expand the use of floating farms to adapt to rising water levels; share expertise in community-driven disaster response with other nations; and develop eco-friendly urban centres that prioritise renewable energy, efficient transportation, and waste management. Bangladesh’s leadership in initiatives like the Climate Vulnerable Forum already showcases its commitment to addressing global challenges. Expanding these efforts could further enhance its reputation.  Strengthening regional and global partnerships BANGLADESH’S foreign policy should prioritise building alliances through trade, cultural exchange, and cooperation on global issues. Strengthening ties within organisations like SAARC and BIMSTEC can boost regional connectivity and economic integration. Balancing relations with neighbouring powers China and India while pursuing strategic interests is vital for geopolitical stability. Bangladesh should even further increase its presence in international forums like the United Nations and cumulatively contribute to peacekeeping, sustainable development, and human rights initiatives.  Conclusion EARNING global respect is a marathon, not a sprint. Bangladesh has already demonstrated its resilience and potential through remarkable achievements in poverty reduction, disaster management, and industrial growth. However, to command lasting admiration, the nation must address its domestic challenges while embracing innovation, inclusivity, and global engagement. By learning from the successes of nations like South Korea, Singapore, and Vietnam—but tailoring strategies to its unique context — Bangladesh can chart a path of sustainable development and peace. Its future lies in its ability to harness its greatest strengths: a hard-working population, a rich cultural heritage, and the capacity to innovate. A respected Bangladesh will not only uplift its citizens but also contribute meaningfully to the global community.

Soil: care for irreplaceable resource,"SENEGALESE conservationist Baba Dioum at a meeting of the International Union for Conservation of Nature in New Delhi in 1968 said: ‘In the end, we will conserve only what we love; we will love only what we understand; and we will understand only what we are taught.’ If we accept the statement to be true, World Soil Day is of paramount importance in conserving soil, a non-renewable resource, by creating global awareness. December 5 has been observed as World Soil Day since 2014 after an official approval by the UN General Assembly in 2013. The birthday of Thai king Bhumibol Adulyadej was chosen for the observance of the day. The day this year is, however, unique because of the message it conveys — ‘Caring for Soils: Measure, Monitor, Manage’ — which emphasises three fundamental approaches to a sustainable use of this irreplaceable resource. Photosynthesis, the single most important life-sustaining process on the planet which converts and stores solar energy in an edible chemical form, would be impossible without the direct and indirect contribution of soil. Plants depend on soil not only for water to sustain photosynthesis and other physiological processes but also for oxygen to breathe, nutrients for nourishment and mechanical support to prevent them from falling over. In short, soil supports flora, which capture energy and nutrients, feed us and provide us with oxygen. Furthermore, it decomposes toxic substances by its microbial battalion which would, otherwise, accumulate in various spheres of the ecosystem and make it dysfunctional. Most of the readymade groundwater that we drink is purified as it travels through the soil profile towards the aquifer through various processes. Considering the vital contribution, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the initiation of human civilisation would have been impossible without the formation of soil. The formation of soil in nature is another epic process, as a 2–3cm depth of soil takes almost 1,000 years to form. This explains why it is both an irreplaceable and, at the same time, a non-renewable natural resource. The soil we see is not merely dust or mud. It is the earth’s skin, a complex mixture of chemical substances formed through intricate interactions among rocks and minerals, climate, vegetation and topography over an extended period on a geological timescale. Perhaps, the history of soil is compelling enough to evoke a philosophical sense of why we should care for it. However, ecological economists estimate that the market price of ecosystem services, ie, goods and services provided by an ecosystem, is tens of trillions of dollars annually, with soil accounting for a lion’s share of the services. One of the services provided by soil that requires additional attention is its role as the third-largest reservoir of carbon. It stores 2.5 trillion tonnes, or 3.4 per cent, of global carbon, following the global ocean and fossil fuels, making it a potential carbon sink and an important determinant of the global carbon market. The phenomena, therefore, strongly validate and provide for both a scientific and economic basis for the utmost necessity of measuring, monitoring and managing soil. Soil is a living biological entity, containing 90-100 million microbes in a single gram. Like other biological entities, soil has a health status, which is determined by its physical, chemical and biological conditions. The diagnosis of soil health defines soil quality, which refers to its ability to function within an ecosystem. World Soil Day this year emphasizes the importance of measuring soil health as it provides insights into the current soil condition. This information helps decision-makers to determine whether the soil is suitable for a particular use or requires treatment, which is a fundamental principle of sustainable soil. Is it, however, possible to evaluate the soil health of such a vast agricultural area? It is possible. This is precisely where Baba Dioum’s words become relevant: if we love the soil, we will conserve it. Establishing community- based soil clinics countrywide makes it possible for peripheral farmers to evaluate their soil health and receive proper consultation on how to cultivate and manage the soil. It ensures the sustainable use of this resource, on one hand, and maximum productivity, on the other hand. Soil, as a dynamic and complex natural body, changes in response to the continuously evolving environment around it. Soil scientists classify soil properties into different categories based on their rate of change. Among them, ephemeral characteristics — eg, level of acidity, nutrient status, water level, etc — change over very short periods and require accurate monitoring as they significantly influence critical management practices like fertilisation and irrigation. In addition to soil clinics, farmers should be trained to use simple portable instruments to measure key ephemeral soil properties and make immediate decisions, enabling the economical use of soil additives and promoting the sustainable management of this valuable resource. Soil researchers from academia and state-owned institutions should monitor and record the properties of the two other categories, ie, intermediate and permanent, to track long-term behavioural changes and informed decision-making. However, caring for the soil through monitoring will largely depend on the implementation of proper monitoring strategies. Another key focus of the day is soil management. In simple terms, soil management refers to the practices and techniques used to maintain or improve soil health. A wide range of soil management approaches is available, such as fertilisation, water management, salinity control, acidity management and others, each designed to address specific soil properties. For proper management practices, information on the existing soil condition is essential and this can only be obtained through regular measurement and monitoring of the soil. In this era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the use of artificial intelligence, including robotics, artificial intelligence-powered sensors, artificial intelligence-based satellite imagery is essential in soil management practices, especially in Bangladesh, where we need to balance a high crop productivity with limited agricultural land while protecting soil health. Reports suggest that Bangladesh’s invaluable soil resources are facing a range of challenges, from already degraded soils (problem soils) to ongoing fertility loss, soil urbanisation and pollution. Consequently, we are confronted with a set of difficulties: first, the urgent need to reclaim degraded soils; second, the prevention of unscientific agricultural land use for urbanisation; and finally, the enhancement of soil productivity to feed nearly 250 million people by 2050 while maintaining soil health. To address these challenges, the only viable solution is to manage the soil through precise measurement, continuous monitoring and proper management. In conclusion, the significance of the day this year lies in fostering global awareness of the importance of caring for soil resources. In Bangladesh, if we manage this resource properly, it will ensure food security and economic stability, preserve the resource for future generations and position Bangladesh as a potential stakeholder in the emerging global carbon market, especially if reclaimed degraded soils are used for carbon sequestration. Thus, we should conserve the soil, not merely out of necessity but as a collective responsibility.

"Indian media, relations between Bangladesh and India","India’s media needs to understand the new reality shaping Bangladesh as it moves forward. Failing to accept this reality or continuing efforts to destabilise the situation will not benefit anyone, writesMahtab Uddin Chowdhury SINCE the fall of the Awami League regime on August 5 amid a student-led mass uprising, there has been a noticeable shift in India-Bangladesh relations. Historically regarded as each other’s closest allies, the two countries share significant geographic and cultural ties. However, tensions have occasionally surfaced, with a considerable portion of the Bangladeshi population perceiving India as the more advantaged party in the bilateral relationship. This perception gained traction during the 15-year rule of the Awami League, a period marked by allegations that India received a disproportionate share of benefits from bilateral agreements. Critics have suggested that this dominance was part of a strategy to maintain AL’s hold on power, even amidst three consecutive sham elections. In the current reality shaped by the fall of Sheikh Hasina, there is growing anticipation among the Bangladeshi people for more equitable and mutually beneficial bilateral relations with India. The focus has shifted towards fostering a balanced partnership that departs from past grievances. However, this transition has brought with it significant criticism of India’s perceived stance as a supporter of Sheikh Hasina during her political decline. This discontent intensified when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted a congratulatory message to Dr Yunus upon his assumption of office as Bangladesh’s chief adviser while simultaneously calling for the safety and security of minorities in Bangladesh. This gesture, though diplomatically framed, sparked heated reactions from various quarters within Bangladesh, as it was seen as an overt intervention in the country’s internal affairs. The situation has been further exacerbated by Indian media’s extensive coverage of Bangladesh’s current political and social instability, often framing it as a crisis centred around attacks on minority groups, particularly Hindus. These reports frequently highlight alleged instances of torture, killings, and discriminatory treatment of minorities but are criticised for lacking comprehensive data to substantiate such claims. This narrative appears to echo the stance promoted by the Awami League, which often positioned itself as the sole guardian of minority safety in Bangladesh. By perpetuating these assumptions without sufficient evidence, Indian media risks fuelling tensions and reinforcing a narrative that minorities in Bangladesh are not safe in this current situation. This approach not only overlooks the complexities of the current situation but also undermines the potential for a constructive and forward-looking relationship between the two nations. On the other hand, the reality presents a starkly different picture. While it is undeniable that some attacks on minorities have occurred, there is little concrete evidence to establish the motives behind these incidents conclusively. A closer examination of most of these cases often reveals that the victims were directly connected to Awami League politics, with many holding positions within the party’s committees. This connection complicates the narrative put forth by some media outlets. While any act of violence — regardless of motive — is unequivocally unacceptable and deserving of strong condemnation, the assumption that these attacks were solely motivated by the victims’ status as minorities fails to account for critical contextual factors. Instead, evidence suggests that these individuals were targeted not because of their religious or ethnic identities but due to their affiliations or roles within the AL. This distinction does not diminish the seriousness of the attacks but highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of the circumstances. Addressing such incidents requires focusing on both ensuring justice for the victims and avoiding sweeping generalisations that could exacerbate communal tensions or serve political agendas. Most recently, the arrest of a former ISKCON leader, Chinmoy Krishna Das, has further intensified the situation. According to government spokesperson Asif Mahmud, Das was arrested on charges of sedition, not as a community or religious leader. However, Indian media once again framed this as an anti-minority action by the Bangladeshi government, fuelling tensions. The situation escalated when protests erupted outside the Chattogram court premises, resulting in the tragic killing of a lawyer by supporters of the Hindu monk on November 26. While fears of nationwide unrest began to surface, the collective response from political parties, religious groups, and civil society showcased a remarkable sense of maturity and unity, successfully de-escalating tensions. Despite this, Indian media persisted in its efforts to misrepresent the incidents, spreading misinformation and attempting to construct narratives detached from the realities on the ground. The repercussions of this disinformation campaign have already manifested in troubling ways. For instance, members of the Hindu Sangharsh Samity in Agartala attacked the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in India’s Tripura, highlighting the real-world implications of such inflammatory reporting. Additionally, growing tensions in border areas have disrupted the transfer of import-export goods, posing a direct threat to the economies of both nations. This situation underscores the urgent need for responsible reporting and diplomatic efforts to prevent misinformation from derailing bilateral relations and fuelling unnecessary conflict. Whatever Indian media has been proposing or portraying is a pure reflection of illicit journalism, bringing no benefit to either country. Having a countering mechanism from Bangladesh to address this disinformation is imperative and requires a comprehensive approach involving the government, media houses, CSOs, student alliances, and political parties. More importantly, India’s media needs to understand the new reality shaping Bangladesh as it moves forward. Failing to accept this reality or continuing efforts to destabilise the situation will not benefit even the minorities living in Bangladesh. Meanwhile, the reality of Indian Muslims remains far below expectations, a fact that Indian media often overlooks.

Criminality in law enforcement units should be addressed,"THE reported involvement of law enforcers in mugging in Dhaka underscores the significance of major police reform. Four people, including two Rapid Action Battalion and police personnel, were arrested on December 2 on charges of their being involved in mugging at the Dhaka airport. Allegations against a section of police personnel over involvement in crimes, including abduction, extortion, smuggling and mugging, have come up before but have largely remain unattended. There are allegations against the police that they demanded money from the arrested ‘to settle legal matters’, popularly referred to as arrest business. Official data show that at least 318 cases were filed against 304 police personnel and 79 were arrested in 2023. In 2022, 1,731 police personnel faced departmental action such as suspension or transfer for their involvement in crimes. It becomes evident that the mechanism to govern the moral conduct of the law enforcers has not been effective. The prime task at hand for the police reforms commission is, therefore, to suggest an effective oversight mechanism. There are also allegations of major rights violations in the hands of law enforcers. In January–July, as Ain O Salish Kendra says, at least eight individuals died in custody. The Australia-based Capital Punishment Justice Project reported at least 2,596 cases of extrajudicial killings in 2009–2022. In the period, about 600 cases of enforced disappearance were reported. And, 100 victims are still missing. In 2013, the government enacted a law as part of its commitment to the Committee against Torture to prohibit torture or cruel, inhuman, degrading punishment or treatment of anyone in police custody and punish the perpetrators, but not many cases were filed. Since the enactment of the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act 2013, only 18 cases have been filed against the police and 14 cases resulted in final reports, without framing any charges against the accused. The remaining cases remained stalled. A major pitfall of the custodial torture and death prevention legislation is that it expects the law enforcement agencies to investigate their own members which risks credible and impartial investigation. The continued failure of the government to address the criminality in the police has, therefore, contributed to a growing public distrust in the police. The interim government has already taken a number of steps, but the main emphasis should be to ensure justice for all past abuses. An effective oversight mechanism should be developed to ensure that such abuses do not recur. An oversight mechanism alone, however, cannot improve the situation unless political parties abandon their tendencies to use the law enforcement units in partisan interests.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/252004/criminality-in-law-enforcement-units-should-be-addressed
Tools against corruption should not be rhetorical,"PASSPORT, road transport administration, law enforcement and judicial services have come up to be the top four corrupt services sectors from 2017 to 2023, as Transparency International Bangladesh surveys for 2023, 2021 and 2017, the latest three of the surveys that the corruption watchdog have published since 1997, show. In the 2021 and 2017 surveys, the most corrupt service sectors were the same and in the same order —  law enforcement, passport, road transport administration and judicial services. Only in the latest, Corruption in Service Sectors: National Household Survey 2023 that was made public on December 3, passport services have topped the list and road transport administration services have defeated law enforcement. Land services sector has come in the fifth place in the 2023 survey whilst in the fifth place, it was health services sector in the 2021 survey and land services sector in the 2017 survey. The 2015 survey lists passport, law enforcement, education, road transport and land administration services as the most corrupt sectors and the 2012 survey lists law enforcement, judicial services, education, agriculture, and tax and customs services as the most corrupt sectors. All this suggests that the government’s claimed commitment towards eliminating corruption, including the National Integrity Strategy that was introduced in October 2012, was hardly anything but rhetorical. The latest report shows that about 71 per cent of the households surveyed faced corruption in getting services in 2023 and 50.8 per cent of the households had to pay bribes for services. It further shows that service-seekers paid Tk 109.02 billion in bribes to get services in 2023 which accounts for 0.22 per cent of the gross domestic product for the 2024 financial year. The survey also adds that service-seekers have paid Tk 1,460 billion in bribes between 2009 and April 2024, almost the whole consecutive tenures of the Awami League government, which was toppled in a mass uprising on August 5, to access essential services. The 2023 report says that 86 per cent of the households seeking passport services faced corruption against 70.5 per cent that the 2021 report showed. In road transport administration services, 85.20 per cent of households are reported by the 2023 survey to have faced corruption against 68.3 per cent in the 2021 survey whilst in law enforcement services, 74.5 per cent of the households are reported by the 2023 survey to have faced corruption against 70.5 per cent as reported in the 2021 survey. Transparency International Bangladesh says that there are several tools to fight corruption but they have not been properly used, causing the persistence of high levels of corruption. If no surveillance, no punishment for offences and rhetorical steps continue to persist, it is only natural that corruption could be institutionalised. If corruption becomes institutionalised, the row would be hard enough for the authorities to hoe. The government should, therefore, take legal action against individuals and quarters involved in corruption and strengthen institutions of accountability and other public agencies so that they could play a role in fighting corruption. In the changed political context, which came about with the toppling of the Awami League government, it should not be that hard given the will.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/252003/tools-against-corruption-should-not-be-rhetorical
