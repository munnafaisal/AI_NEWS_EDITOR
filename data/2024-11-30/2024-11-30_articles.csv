"Flawed, wholesale cases may hinder justice","The filing of flawed and wholesale cases over the murders of and attacks on protesters during the student-people uprising is likely to hinder justice and pave the way for perpetrators to escape punishment. Police headquarters officials said that over 2,500 cases were filed over the incidents of murders and attacks during the mass uprising till mid-November. They also said that about 8,000 people were arrested in mass uprising cases till October 31. The investigation into the cases excepting those filed with the International Crimes Tribunal remains slow in three months and a half of the ouster of the regime of Sheikh Hasina by the uprising on August 5. The flaws in cases include naming people who have died or are living out of the country, showing people alive as killed during the uprising and many more inconsistencies, said law enforcement officials dealing with the cases. In some cases, the plaintiffs do not know the people named in the cases and allegations have it that some students and political people have prepared the complaints to frame their opponents. ‘I do not know the people named in the case as students and lawyers drafted the complaint and I was asked to put my signature on it,’ said Abdul Matin, the father of schoolboy Abdul Motalib, who was allegedly killed in police firing at Jigattala in the capital on August 4. Matin filed the case with the Dhanmandi police station against 176 people, including deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina, former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan, former jute and textile minister Jahangir Kabir Nanak and former shipping minister Shajahan Khan, on August 26. Matin alleged that neither Zainul Haque Sikder  Women’s Medical College and Hospital provided him with a death certificate nor the police ensured the postmortem examination after more than three months of his son’s death. Matin, a day labourer, said that police officers told him that the body of his son Motalib, a Class VIII student of Moneshwar Government Primary School at Hazaribagh, would be exhumed after the rainy season. ‘I informed the investigation officer about a month ago but he did not contact me so far,’ he added. Home adviser retired lieutenant general Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said, ‘We are taking necessary legal steps so that no false or fictitious case is filed.’ After the 4th advisory council meeting on law and order on November 24, he also said that the government formed a committee to prevent harassment of the people named in false cases. On November 13, law adviser Asif Nazrul said that it was embarrassing for the interim government that dubious and unsubstantiated cases were being filed. He said that they had sought advice from the Judiciary Reform Commission to address the issues legally. Bangladesh Nationalist Party Dutpara union unit general secretary Nurul Amin filed a murder case with the Araihazar police station on August 22 accusing deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina and 130 others. The plaintiff accused Hasina and 130 others of killing Md Babul Mia, 49, during the mass uprising on August 4, although Babul died of a stroke at DKMC Hospital Ltd at Rupganj on June 3. The deceased Babul Mia, was a driver’s assistant at Meghla Paribahan and then became the owner of three buses of the company. Before death, Babul Mia was reportedly campaigning as a candidate for the BNP’s labour body Sramik Dal’s Araihazar upazila unit president. ‘My husband fell sick in the morning on June 3, we took him to the DKMC Hospital where he died on the day and the hospital doctors declared that he died of a stroke,’ victim’s wife Monira Sarker said. She said that she did not know Nurul Amin, 43, who filed the case. Araihazar police station officer-in-charge Md Enayet Hossian said that they were investigating the case. ‘Anyone can file a case but we can say if it is false or not  after investigation,’ he added. An attempt to murder case has been filed against 180 people, including Supreme Court lawyer and rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra chairman ZI Khan Panna, for an attack on a youth, Ahadul Islam, on July 19. Ahadul’s father Md Baker filed the case with the Khilgaon police station in Dhaka on October 17. On October 21, Baker, however, petitioned Khilgaon police station officer-in-charge Md Daud Hossain requesting him to drop Panna from the case amid huge criticisms. Baker, hailed from Mehendiganj in Barishal, claimed that the Supreme Court lawyer was mistakenly implicated in the case due to the former’s ignorance. The officer-in-charge instructed subinspector Imran Hossain to take appropriate steps. The senior lawyer also secured an anticipatory bail in the case on October 21. Supreme Court lawyer and rights activists Sara Hossain said that vexatious cases were being filed by individuals and private parties, but state agencies — police and courts — kept processing arrests, rejecting bail and remanding people in custody. ‘We have seen such misrule under many different administrations but this is the time to make a change from the past, not to repeat what has been done before,’ said Sara. She suggested that a high-level body should be established by the government with experts to oversee the process of justice and accountability for the cases relating to the uprising. ‘This means curbing the filing of wholesale cases, ensuring investigation by an independent and high-level team, scrutinising the cases to screen out vexatious cases, establishing a policy and priorities for prosecution,’ she added. Three deceased Awami League leaders — Cumilla south city AL former forest and environment affairs secretary Abdul Momin, its former agriculture affairs secretary Md Kamal Uddin Majumdar, and former member Wahidur Rahman Farid — have been accused of attack on the recent anti-discrimination student protests in Cumilla. Comilla Sadar south model police station officer-in-charge Mohammad Rafiqul Islam said, ‘The matter will be investigated and If deceased people are found to be named in the case, they will be dropped.’ Student Movement Against Discrimination coordinator and Cumilla University student Md Emran filed the case against 96 people, including former finance minister AHM Mustafa Kamal’s younger brother and former upazila chairman Golam Sarwar and former upazila chairman Abdul Hai Bablu as prime accused. Abu Sayeed, son of Abdul Momen who died on June 24 after being hit by a train, said, ‘My father died in June and how could he participate in the August 4 attack?’ Kamal Uddin Mazumder died of a heart attack on July 11, 2023, his neighbour Aminul Islam said, terming prosecution of a dead person  highly reprehensible. Farhad, son of Wahidur Rahman Farid, said that his father died of kidney disease in September 2023. ‘It is extremely unfair to name a man who died a year ago in a case for an incident taking place a year later,’ he said. The police arrested Kulsum Begum on November 21 on the charge of filing a false case claiming her husband’s death during the mass uprising. Kulsum filed the murder case against 130 people with the Dhaka Chief Judicial Magistrate Court on October 24, claiming that her husband Al Amin, 34, was shot dead while taking part in a procession at Ashulia on August 5. A team of Ashulia police station, acting on a tip-off, arrested Kulsum and two of her accomplices Ruhul Amin and Shafikul Islam in Cox’s Bazar on Thursday. Ashulia police station recorded a first information report over the complaint on November 8. The Police Headquarters assistant inspector general Enamul Haque Sagar urged people not to worry about false cases and innocent people would not be charged or arrested. Asked about the slow pace in the investigation, Enamul said, ‘We are conducting the investigations slowly to ensure a proper investigation. We want to ensure justice for the victims and punishment for the perpetrators.’ Professor Muhammad Yunus-led interim government took oath on August 8 following Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to India amid student mass uprising on August 5. Many perpetrators in the uprising, including Awami League and its associate bodies leaders and activists, police and bureaucrats are still in hiding.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251673/flawed-wholesale-cases-may-hinder-justice
"Full list of martyrs, injured people’s treatment demanded","People injured in the student-led July-August mass uprising, academics and other speakers on Saturday demanded a full list of those martyred in the movement. They also demanded timely treatment and rehabilitation for the injured. Their call on the government came at a rally organised by the ‘Children and guardians forum’ at Central Shaheed Minar in the capital. The families of the martyred and the injured in the uprising attended the rally. Presiding over the event, economist Anu Muhammad said that the government’s top priorities should have been preparing a complete list of those killed along with the rehabilitation and treatment of the injured, reducing the prices of essentials and restructuring of the law enforcement agencies. ‘But the government has failed in all these areas, undermining the core aspirations of the mass uprising,’ he said, urging the government, which took charge after the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League regime fell on August 5, to take more significant steps to address these issues. Emphasising the urgency of preparing the complete list of martyrs and injured individuals, the professor said, ‘In 53 years, we have failed to create an accurate list of 1971 freedom fighters. Many died without any state recognition. We cannot let this happen again with the July-August movement.’ Addressing the event as the chief guest, Sharmeen Murshid, adviser to the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs and the Ministry of Social Welfare, admitted that the complete list of martyrs had yet to be finalised. The adviser also admitted possible shortcomings in the government efforts to ensure proper treatment of the injured, but asserted that there was no lack of effort from the government’s end in this regard. She requested the injured individuals to form a committee of up to 25 people and meet with the government to discuss ways forward to ensure their treatment and rehabilitation. At the event, injured individuals also shared their stories, describing how they were tortured and falsely arrested by the now ousted Awami League regime during the movement. Bangladesh Nationalist Party standing committee member Abdul Moyeen Khan and Jahangirnagar University pro vice-chancellor Sohel Ahmed also spoke at the programme. According to the latest government data, around 1,500 students, workers and citizens lost their lives during the July uprising, with 19,931 others injured.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251671/full-list-of-martyrs-injured-peoples-treatment-demanded

Aid workers killed in Gaza,"Gaza’s civil defence agency said three aid workers were killed in an Israeli air strike in the Hamas-run territory on Saturday but the Israeli army said it killed a ‘terrorist’. The agency said the aid workers killed were Palestinian employees of World Central Kitchen. The US aid group did not immediately respond to AFP requests for comment. The Israeli army said it had ‘struck a vehicle with a terrorist that took part in the murderous October 7 massacre’, referring to militant group Hamas’s unprecedented attack on Israel last year. ‘The claim that the terrorist was simultaneously a WCK worker is being examined,’ it added in a statement. Civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the bodies of ‘at least five dead were transported (to hospital), including (those of) the three employees of World Central Kitchen’. ‘All three men worked for WCK and they were hit while driving in a WCK jeep in Khan Yunis,’ Bassal said, adding that the vehicle had been ‘marked with its logo clearly visible’. The Israeli army insisted its strike in the main southern city hit ‘a civilian unmarked vehicle and its movement on the route was not coordinated for transporting of aid’. In April, an Israeli air strike killed seven WCK staff—an Australian, three Britons, a North American, a Palestinian and a Pole. Israel said it had been targeting a ‘Hamas gunman’ in that strike but the military admitted a series of ‘grave mistakes’ and violations of its own rules of engagement. Meanwhile, the Israeli military said it carried out strikes against Hezbollah on Saturday after detecting activity in southern Lebanon ‘that posed a threat’ days into a ceasefire. The truce, which was intended to end more than a year of cross-border hostilities and two months of open warfare between Israel and Hezbollah, began early on Wednesday morning. As part of the terms of the deal, the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers will deploy in southern Lebanon as the Israeli army withdraws over a period of 60 days.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/251667/aid-workers-killed-in-gaza

Southampton denied shock Brighton win,"Southampton were denied victory by a controversial VAR decision in a 1-1 draw at high-flying Brighton on Friday. Flynn Downes had just cancelled out Kaoru Mitoma’s opener for Brighton when Cameron Archer thought he had put the Saints 2-1 up. A VAR check of more than four minutes eventually decided Archer was onside but penalised Adam Armstrong, who was offside but did not touch the ball, for interfering with play. Southampton had to settle for a first away point of the season as a result and remain bottom of the table, four points adrift of safety. A point was enough to lift Brighton up to second on alphabetical order ahead of Manchester City, who face leaders Liverpool in the pick of the weekend’s action on Sunday. Brighton were left to rue not making more of a dominant first-half display. Georginio Rutter hit the post and fired another effort wide, while Mitoma wasted a huge chance in the opening stages. Brighton’s pressure finally paid off on the half hour mark when Mitoma stooped to head in Tariq Lamptey’s cross. Southampton levelled 13 minutes into the second half with the impressive Tyler Dibling the architect. The teenager’s square ball teed up Armstrong, whose shot was blocked, but the loose ball found its way to Downes, who hammered home first time from the edge of the area. Eight minutes later Dibling wriggled clear of three Brighton players inside his own half and then spread the ball to Fraser. His low cross evaded Armstrong and was finished at the far post by Archer - only to be chalked off to the dismay of boss Russell Martin. ‘I’m fed up talking about decisions,’ said Martin. ‘We were told it affects Bart Verbruggen ability (to play the ball) and if Adam’s run moved Verbruggen from his position then I would understand the decision, but he hasn’t moved. ‘I cannot see how it has affected the goalkeeper.’ The VAR delay led to 13 minutes of added time and Brighton nearly snatched victory at the death. Simon Adingra’s effort on the stretch flicked off the outside of the far post.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/251659/southampton-denied-shock-brighton-win

Batting first, Khulna made 79-2 with opener Anamul Haque Bijoy scoring 50 off 72 runs and remained unbeaten with Mohammad Mithun (5) at the crease.

Police raid bars in Moscow over ‘LGBT propaganda’,"Police in Moscow raided multiple bars early Saturday and arrested the director of a gay travel agency under laws criminalising ‘LGBT propaganda’, state media reported. The raids came on the one year anniversary of Russia’s Supreme Court outlawing the ‘international LGBT movement’, paving the way for arrests and prosecutions of the country’s already repressed LGBTQ community. Russian security forces raided at least three bars and nightclubs overnight ‘as part of measures to combat LGBT propaganda’, the state TASS news agency reported. Social media videos from the Arma nightclub, the former premises of the Mutabor, showed club-goers sitting on the dancefloor while riot police walked around shouting orders. Another video showed people being walked out of the popular Mono gay club in central Moscow with their hands above their heads, with a police van parked outside. The interior ministry said police had also raided an unnamed nightclub on Skladochnaya Street that had been ‘propagandising the ideology of the banned LGBT movement’. The Interfax news agency named the club as ‘Inferno Night’. Police in the capital also arrested the director of a travel agency for gay men on suspicion of ‘organising tours for members of the LGBT community’. The 48-year-old director of ‘Men Travel’ was suspected of ‘preparing a trip for supporters of non-traditional sexual values to go to Egypt for the New Year holidays’, the TASS news agency reported Saturday, citing law enforcement. The Kremlin has ramped up conservative rhetoric since launching its military assault on Ukraine almost three years ago, casting the conflict as a battleground against the West and its values. Rights groups say the country is waging an unprecedented crackdown on LGBTQ people that has seen the owners of gay bars arrested and anyone associated with promoting LGBTQ rights prosecuted.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/251655/police-raid-bars-in-moscow-over-lgbt-propaganda
Bangladesh’s share in US market rises,"Bangladesh’s share in the United States’ denim trouser imports has steadily grown by 6.6 percentage points over the past seven years, increasing from 14.1 per cent in 2017 to 20.7 per cent as of September 2024 although the overall imports of the item by the US declined in the period. According to data released by the Office of Textiles and Apparel under the US Department of Commerce, Bangladesh’s export value of denim trousers to the US rose from $495 million in 2017 to a peak of $927 million in 2022. After a peak in 2022, Bangladesh’s exports fell to $639 million in 2023 and further to $491 million in nine months (January-September) of 2024. Despite global uncertainties, Bangladesh has remained as one of the top exporters, competing directly with Mexico and surpassing traditional leaders like China. The OTEXA data showed that Mexico’s share declined from 22.5 per cent in 2017 to 17.1 per cent in 2020, recovering slightly to 20.6 per cent in 2023 and dropping again to 19.6 per cent in September 2024. China’s market share in the US denim trouser imports dropped significantly, from 25.4 per cent in 2017 to 8.5 per cent in 2022 and 10.3 per cent in September 2024. The data also suggested that China’s decline was stark, from $892 million in 2017 to $246 million in nine months (January-September) of 2024. Industry experts said that the trend was aligned with global shifts in sourcing away from China due to rising costs and geopolitical factors, and Bangladesh capitalised on this trend, gaining market share. Former Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association vice-president Abdullah Hil Rakib termed the current trend in work orders ‘very good’. He expressed optimism for 2025, saying that huge work orders were coming and his factory’s outerwear capacity had already been fully booked for that year. He, however, raised concerns about the rising share in a shrinking market, attributing the decline in the denim market to changing lifestyle preferences and sustainability issues. Rakib said that consumers were increasingly opting for functional wear, such as activewear, sportswear, and athleisure — categories that cater to women’s needs for both style and performance. He further explained that denim is often not seen as a sustainable option, as its production required significant water usage. The OTEXA data also indicated that Pakistan’s market share more than doubled in the past seven years, rising from 6 per cent in 2017 to 12.7 per cent in nine months (January-September) of 2024. Vietnam’s share in the US denim trouser imports raised from 5.8 per cent in 2017 to 11.5 per in the nine months of 2024. Square Denim director Syeed Ahmad Chowdhury said that Bangladesh’s increasing share in the US denim trouser market was primarily driven by buyers shifting away from China. Additionally, Turkey’s drastic reduction in denim production also contributed to this shift, he said. He said that while the decline of China and Turkey played a role in Bangladesh’s market share growth, it did not imply that manufacturing in Bangladesh had not faced challenges. Regarding the shrinking market share in the US denim market, Syeed said that US demand was growing more slowly than in the EU, with the US being Bangladesh’s single largest destination. He also mentioned that orders from China and Turkey were increasingly shifting to Bangladesh, Mexico, and Pakistan.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/apparel/251654/bangladeshs-share-in-us-market-rises
Nations warn of deadlock at plastic pollution talks,"Diplomats warned Saturday that a majority of countries could walk away from talks on the world’s first plastic pollution agreement if a handful of delegations continue resisting calls to compromise. Nearly 200 countries are in South Korea’s Busan for negotiations on a deal to curb plastic pollution. But efforts to reach the landmark agreement are locked over several key sticking points, particularly reducing production and phasing out chemicals believed or known to harm human health. Over 100 countries back those measures, and insist a treaty without them will fail to solve the pollution crisis. But around a dozen nations — mostly producers of plastic precursors derived from fossil fuels — are strongly opposed. As a result, just a day before talks are supposed to end, the draft text remains full of opposing views and contradictory language. And frustration is growing. ‘The overwhelming majority of delegates here demand an ambitious treaty,’ said Panama’s delegation head Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez. ‘If the reduction of production is not there, there is no treaty.’ ‘We cannot let a few loud voices derail the process,’ he added. A diplomat from the High Ambition Coalition, which groups dozens of countries seeking a strong deal, echoed that sentiment. ‘We are a large group uniting around key effective elements, and getting ready to walk away,’ he told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss closed-door deliberations. He warned that ‘some countries’ were actively considering calling a vote, which would circumvent the UN’s traditional approach of agreement by consensus and could ‘raise a lot of eyebrows.’ It was a possibility being increasingly discussed as a ‘last resort,’ said the Democratic Republic of Congo’s J.M. Bope Bope Lapwong. ‘I think that if we can’t reach an agreement, we’ll be obliged to go to a vote. We cannot come all this way, all these kilometres, to fail,’ he told AFP. ‘True, it’s not the usual way at UN meetings, and we will do it to our shame—because when you negotiate, you don’t expect to win it all.’ More than 90 percent of plastic is not recycled, while plastic production is expected to triple by 2060. Environmental groups have pushed ambitious countries to move to a vote if progress stalls, arguing that countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia have not offered any compromises during talks. Neither delegation responded to repeated requests by AFP for comment. ‘A handful of governments... are looking backwards and refusing to take the steps necessary for us all to advance,’ said Greenpeace’s Graham Forbes. ‘I think we are at a very risky moment right now of being sold out, and that would be an absolute catastrophe.’ But observers warned that calling a vote would be a risky strategy that could alienate even some countries in favour of a strong treaty. Another option would be for the diplomat chairing the talks to simply gavel through an agreement over the objections of a handful of holdouts, they said. But that too holds risks, potentially embittering the remaining diplomatic process and jeopardising adoption of a treaty down the road. ‘We don’t want to move outside the framework of the United Nations,’ said an official from the French environment ministry. ‘We hope we will find agreement between now and tomorrow and that’s the option that we’re focused on,’ he added. ‘A lot can happen in 24 hours.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/251653/nations-warn-of-deadlock-at-plastic-pollution-talks
Transactions thru MFS increase,"The volume of transactions through the mobile financial services increased in September for the second month. According to Bangladesh Bank data, the amount of transactions increased to Tk 1,45,067 crore in September compared with that of Tk 1,37,920 crore in August and Tk 1,22,922 crore in July. September’s transaction amount included Tk 41,694 crore as cash-in, Tk 45,381 crore as cash-out, Tk 39,470 crore as person-to-person transfers, Tk 6,588 crore as merchant payments, Tk 48.45 crore as government-to-person transfers, Tk 4,499 crore as salary disbursements and Tk 3,240 crore as utility bill payments. Customers also purchased talk-time worth Tk 1,049 crore using MFS in September. The number of mobile financial service accounts increased by 2.6 crore over the year to 22.7 crore in April 2024 compared with that of 20 crore in the same month in 2023. Of the total number in April, 9.9 crore accounts were in urban areas and 12.7 crore in rural areas. The decline in MFS transactions in April, after a robust growth in the previous four months, was attributed to sluggish activities after Eid-ul-Fitr, one of the biggest religious festivals of the Muslims, which was observed in the country on April 11. Despite this dip, the overall trend in MFS transactions remained positive as customers increasingly utilise MFS for various payments due to its convenience within a growing digital financial ecosystem. MFS transactions were Tk 1,55,835 crore in June, but plunged in July due to countrywide protests over job quota reforms, which eventually deposed Sheikh Hasina as prime minister on August 5. After that, business activities have begun to normalise gradually, leading a surge in MFS transaction in the following two months. The introduction of new services by operators has driven this growth, reflecting a shift in consumer behaviour towards digital transactions, accelerated by the COVID pandemic, which boosted the popularity of online purchases and MFS. Inward remittance through MFS channels has also been growing, with the government providing cash incentives to attract more remittance. In September 2024, inward remittance disbursed through MFS channels amounted to Tk 1,021 crore. Furthermore, disbursements of government stipends, contributions and private-sector wages through the MFS have contributed to the sector’s growth. MFS customers can now make a wide range of payments, including utility bills and talk-time purchases, and can easily add to or deposit money in their MFS accounts from different bank accounts. Additionally, customers can now pay street vendors, known as micro-merchants, from their MFS wallets, representing a significant development in the MFS ecosystem. In response to widespread adoption, the Bangladesh Bank has raised the transaction limit through MFS. Some MFS operators have offered discounts against shopping payments using their services. The MFS began its journey in the country in 2011 with the launch of Rocket, Dutch-Bangla Bank’s mobile financial service. Currently, 13 MFS operators provide services, with bKash, Nagad, Rocket, Upay, mCash, and SureCash being the major market players.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/251652/transactions-thru-mfs-increase
Foreign loan drops by 26pc in July-Oct,"The disbursement of foreign loans in the first four month of the current financial year dropped by 26 per cent due mainly to the regime change in the country, economists said. The country’s multilateral and bilateral lenders disbursed $1,202.00 million in the July-October of FY25 compared with $1626.17 million during the same period of FY24, according to the Economic Relations Division update released on November 28. Slowdown in the foreign loan disbursement was high in the July-September period of FY25 as the ERD calculated the rate at 35 per cent to $831.12 million from $1,276.22 million in FY24. Economists said the trend was not unusual against the backdrop of the regime change on August 5 amid a mass uprising and the assumption in power by the interim government. The new government is reviewing many annual development programme projects, including lenders-driven ones, to find out the politically motivated and less important projects. It is also renegotiating with lenders regarding many projects taken by the immediate past political regime, said former World Bank Dhaka office chief economist Zahid Hussain. The slowdown in disbursement of foreign loan is not unusual, he said. Because of the slowdown in disbursement of the foreign loans the ongoing pressure on the government in repayment of debt is increasing. The government paid back $1,437.90 million in the July-October period of FY25 compared with that of $1,101.50 million during the same period of FY24. The rate of increase was 29 per cent in the July-September of FY25. Institute for Inclusive Finance and Development executive director MK Mujeri said that the interim government needed dynamism in negotiating with the lenders to reverse the trend. He said that a positive development was imperative to tackle the economic downturn persisting since 2022 amid a shortage of dollars because of mismanagement and flawed policies by the immediate past political regime. Over the past three years until FY24, the Bangladesh Bank sold more than $34 billion to commercial banks depleting the country’s foreign exchange reserve which is now hovering at $19 billion. In the past month, Moody’s in a report downgraded Bangladesh’s credit rating citing heightened political risks and lower growth. The global leading agency lowered the rating to B2 from B1 as it found that the country’s outlook had been changed to ‘negative’ from ‘stable’.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/251651/foreign-loan-drops-by-26pc-in-july-oct
Stocks decline for 2nd week,"Dhaka stocks fell slightly in the past week, extending the falling streak to the second week, as a section of investors sold shares to protect their funds from further erosion, market operators said. They said that investors were active on both sides of the trading fence, however, opportunistic investors sought profit booking. DSEX, the key index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, decreased by 4.99 points, or 0.10 per cent, in the past week to end at 5,192.59 points, after decreasing by 157.75 points in the previous week. Investors were cautious as the earnings declarations by companies are going on, market operators said. Also, higher bank interest rates are inspiring investors to invest in fixed-income options instead of the stock market, they said. The daily average turnover on the DSE decreased in the past week to reach Tk 381.31 crore compared with that of Tk 465.80 crore in the previous week. Of the 390 issues traded in the past week, 213 increased, 126 decreased and 51 stayed the same. Investors were mostly active in bank scrips, followed by pharmaceutical and food shares. EBL Securities in its weekly market commentary said, ‘Market volatility persisted throughout the week as sellers maintained their dominance, while opportunistic investors preferred to observe the market’s trend and sit on cash to look for lucrative investment opportunities following the corrections.’ ‘However, the market logged a slight recovery due to some positive sentiment following media reports regarding the central bank’s approval of the anticipated Tk 30 billion sovereign-guaranteed loan to ICB. Nevertheless, profit-booking by wary investors soon eroded most of the gains in the final session amidst the waning market momentum,’ it added. The DS30 index decreased by 2.82 points, or 0.15 per cent, to finish at 1,916.23 points. Only the DSE Shariah index gained, by 15.33 points, or 1.33 per cent, to close at 1,166.89 points in the past week. NRB Bank topped the average weekly turnover chart with shares worth Tk 15.70 crore changing hands per session. Taufika Foods and Lovello Ice-cream, Bangladesh Shipping Corporation, Agni Systems, Midland Bank, Genex Infosys, Eastern Bank, Beach Hatchery, Alif Industries and Fine Foods were the other turnover leaders.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/stocks/251650/stocks-decline-for-2nd-week
100 Rohingya refugees rescued off Indonesia,"More than 100 Rohingya refugees including women and children have been rescued after their boat sank off the coast of Indonesia, the United Nations refugee agency said Saturday. The mostly Muslim ethnic Rohingya are heavily persecuted in Myanmar and thousands risk their lives each year on long and dangerous sea journeys to reach Malaysia or Indonesia. ‘We received a report from the East Aceh government that there are 116 refugees in total,’ UNHCR’s Faisal Rahman told AFP on Saturday. ‘The refugees are still on the beach right now, it has not been decided where they would be taken.’ He said the flimsy wooden boat carrying the Rohingyas was found half-submerged not far from the beach off the coast of northeastern Sumatra island. A local fisherman, Saifudin Taher said the boat was first spotted entering East Aceh waters on Saturday morning, and a few hours later it nearly sank. ‘All passengers survived, but one of them was ill and ...immediately received treatment,’ Saifudin told AFP, adding the boat was only 100 metres away from the beach, and the refugees could walk easily to safety. Rohingya arrivals in Indonesia tend to follow a cyclical pattern, slowing during the stormy months and picking back up when sea conditions calm down. Last month, 152 Rohingya refugees were finally brought ashore after being anchored for days off the coast of South Aceh district for days while officials decided whether to let them land. Indonesia is not a signatory to the UN refugee convention and says it cannot be compelled to take in refugees from Myanmar, calling instead on neighbouring countries to share the burden and resettle Rohingya who arrives on its shores. Many Acehnese, who have memories of decades of bloody conflict themselves, are sympathetic to the plight of their fellow Muslims. But others say their patience has been tested, claiming the Rohingya consume scarce resources and occasionally come into conflict with locals. In December 2023, hundreds of students forced the relocation of more than 100 Rohingya refugees, storming a community hall in Aceh where they were sheltering and vandalising their belongings.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/251649/100-rohingya-refugees-rescued-off-indonesia
Trudeau in Florida to meet Trump as tariff threats loom,"Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau traveled to Florida on Friday for a dinner with Donald Trump at the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago estate, as the incoming US leader promised tariffs on Canadian imports. The unannounced meeting came at the end of a week that has seen Canada as well as Mexico scramble to blunt the impact of Trump’s trade threats, which experts have warned could also hit US consumers hard. A smiling Trudeau was seen exiting a hotel in West Palm Beach before arriving at Mar-a-Lago, making him the latest high-profile guest of Trump, whose impending second term—which starts in January—is already overshadowing the last few months of President Joe Biden’s administration. Flight trackers had first spotted a jet broadcasting the prime minister’s callsign making its way to the southern US state. A Canadian government source later told AFP that the two leaders were dining together. Trump caused panic among some of the biggest US trading partners on Monday when he said he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on Mexican and Canadian imports and 10 percent on goods from China. He accused the countries of not doing enough to halt the ‘invasion’ of the United States by drugs, ‘in particular fentanyl,’ and undocumented migrants. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke with Trump by phone on Wednesday, though the two leaders’ accounts of the conversation differed drastically. Trump claimed that Mexico’s left-wing president had ‘agreed to stop migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border.’ Sheinbaum later said she had discussed US-supported anti-migration policies that have long been in place in Mexico. She said that after that, the talks had no longer revolved around the threat of tariff hikes, downplaying the risk of a trade war. Biden warned that same day that Trump’s tariff threats could ‘screw up’ Washington’s relationships with Ottawa and Mexico City. ‘I think it’s a counterproductive thing to do,’ Biden told reporters. Trudeau did not respond to questions from the media as he returned to his hotel Friday evening after meeting with Trump. But for Canada, the stakes of any new tariffs are high. More than three-quarters of Canadian exports, or Can$592.7 billion ($423 billion), went to the United States last year, and nearly two million Canadian jobs are dependent on trade. A Canadian government source told AFP that Canada is considering possible retaliatory tariffs against the United States. Some have suggested Trump’s tariff threat may be bluster, or an opening salvo in future trade negotiations. But Trudeau rejected those views when he spoke with reporters earlier in Prince Edward Island province. ‘Donald Trump, when he makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out,’ Trudeau said. ‘There’s no question about it.’ According to the website Flightradar, the Canadian leader’s plane landed at Palm Beach International Airport late Friday afternoon. Canadian public broadcaster CBC said that Trudeau’s public safety minister, Dominic LeBlanc, was accompanying him on the trip.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/251648/trudeau-in-florida-to-meet-trump-as-tariff-threats-loom
Inflation-wary US consumers flock to ‘Black Friday’ deals,"US shoppers were out in force for ‘Black Friday,’ with preliminary data showing strong online sales despite inflation nerves prompting retailers in the world’s biggest economy to come up with ever more deals. As markets and consumers eye possible turbulence during the transition from President Joe Biden to Donald Trump, there are hopes that the year’s biggest shopping season — stretching from Thanksgiving to Christmas — will be a bonanza. The National Retail Federation (NRF) said a record 183.4 million people are planning to shop over the weekend, ticking up from 182 million last year and 18.1 million higher than 2019, before the Covid pandemic derailed the global economy. Adobe Analytics said US consumers had spent $7.9 billion online as of Friday afternoon, an increase of 8.2 per cent over last year, with a projected final tally between $10.7 and $11 billion — an e-commerce record for Black Friday. The so-called ‘Black Friday’ discounts day originated as a single day when shoppers poured — sometimes stampeded — into malls in search of incredible deals, but is now accompanied by ‘Small Business Saturday’ and ‘Cyber Monday.’ While inflation has been largely tamed from its post-Covid spike, Americans remain wary, with consumer prices still significantly elevated above their pre-pandemic levels. Beatrice Judon, a shopper ‘over 75’ years old, described the situation as ‘challenging.’ ‘We hope things get better,’ she told AFP after a trip to a department store in the US capital. ‘We just have to wait and see.’ Holiday shoppers in 2024 are ‘even more preoccupied and very focused around value and discounts,’ said Vivek Pandya, leading insights analyst at Adobe Digital Insights. Discontent with high costs was seen as one of the main reasons Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election this month. Target CEO Brian Cornell told analysts earlier this month that after a lengthy period of inflation, ‘consumers tell us their budgets remain stretched.’ ‘They’re becoming increasingly resourceful in their shopping behaviors, waiting to buy until (the) last moment of need, focusing on deals and then stocking up when they find them,’ he said. ‘It’s pretty expensive to live in America in general,’ said Tyler Austin, 25, who was out shopping Friday in downtown Washington for clothes ‘to upgrade the wardrobe.’ Despite the negative perceptions of the economy, the NRF has projected holiday spending to grow between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent over last year, to as much as $989 billion over the two-month period. President Joe Biden did his part to support the US economy on Black Friday by visiting a bookshop on the Massachusetts island of Nantucket, where he is currently on holiday with his family. The inflationary environment has weighed especially heavily on households with lower incomes, with banks pointing to rising charge-off rates as an indicator of increased stress. But budget-conscious retailer Burlington Stores is seeing some of the strongest sales in low-income zip codes, said Chief Executive Michael O’Sullivan. ‘Maybe for the first time since 2021, it looks like their real incomes are finally edging up,’ O’Sullivan said on a conference call this week. Wall Street stocks closed higher during the shortened trading session on Friday with the Dow and S&P 500 indexes both hitting fresh records. Thanksgiving, which is always the fourth Thursday in November, falls on its latest possible date in 2024. As a result, retailers are pivoting to a shopping season with five fewer days than last year, which analysts say may be responsible for the outsized early sales. While Black Friday deals are often targeted at people living in the United States, they also draw tourists and bargain-hunters from abroad. ‘We came mostly for the experience but we’ve also found some very good deals,’ Mario Clemente, a tourist from the Mexican city of Guadalajara told AFP during a trip to a shopping mall in Los Angeles. ‘Compared to Mexico, it’s much cheaper to come here, even when you add the hotel and the flight,’ he said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/251647/inflation-wary-us-consumers-flock-to-black-friday-deals
China manufacturing expands for second straight month,"China in November saw an uptick in industrial output for the second straight month, government data showed Saturday, an encouraging sign for officials as they battle stagnant activity. Beijing has in recent weeks announced a slew of the most aggressive measures in years aimed at boosting growth in the world’s second-largest economy, which has struggled to fully recover since the pandemic. A key measure of activity in the manufacturing sector, the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), was 50.3 in November, according to data published by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The latest PMI reading marks the second straight month of expansion — indicated by a figure above 50 — after a five-month run in negative territory that ended in October. And it came in higher than a Bloomberg forecast, which had predicted the figure to stand at 50.2. Since late September, Beijing has unveiled a string of measures aimed at bolstering growth, including cutting interest rates, cancelling restrictions on homebuying and easing the debt burden on local governments. But economists have warned that more direct fiscal stimulus aimed at shoring up domestic consumption is needed to restore full health in China’s economy as fears of a renewed trade war with the United States mount. Writing ahead of Saturday’s data release by the NBS, Chang Shu and David Qu of Bloomberg Economics said that the expected increase in November’s PMI “reflects a seasonal tendency to rise following a holiday-led lull in October, not an economy that’s gearing up”. Beijing is targeting annual growth this year of around five per cent — a goal that officials have recently expressed confidence in achieving. But many observers are more sceptical, with the IMF in October revising its forecast for China’s economic growth this year to 4.8 per cent. The International Monetary Fund anticipates that figure slowing further to 4.5 per cent next year.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/251646/china-manufacturing-expands-for-second-straight-month
Moody’s downgrades Hungary outlook on institutional ‘weaknesses’,"The US ratings agency Moody’s downgraded its outlook for Hungary’s government debt Friday citing ‘institutional and governance weaknesses’ and concerns its antagonistic relationship with the EU could have financial consequences. Hungary is a recipient of substantial amounts of funding from the European Union, which are conditional on meeting certain criteria, including adherence to the rule of law. The country’s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, has clashed with Brussels on a range of issues in recent years, some of which could see it lose out on those EU funds, Moody’s indicated in a note explaining its decision. ‘Our decision to change the outlook to negative (from stable) reflects downside risks related to the quality of Hungary’s institutions and governance,’ Moody’s analysts wrote in a note explaining their decision. What that means, they said, is that Hungary could ultimately lose out on a ‘substantial’ amount of EU money ‘because it does not meet the conditions for the release of these funds.’ ‘In turn, this could lower trend GDP growth and weaken fiscal and debt metrics,’ they added. In the same note, Moody’s affirmed Hungary’s investment grade foreign- and local-currency credit rating of Baa2. Moody’s said that the total EU funds allocated to Hungary were equivalent to around 3.4 per cent of economic output per year. Given the ongoing ‘difficult negotiations’ between Hungary and the EU, Moody’s noted there were ‘elevated risks that Hungary will miss out on a substantial amount’ of some of that funding.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/251645/moodys-downgrades-hungary-outlook-on-institutional-weaknesses
Sri Lanka records highest deflation since 1961,"Sri Lanka’s consumer prices fell by 2.1 per cent in November, the highest deflation rate recorded by the economically fragile island nation since 1961, official data showed Saturday. An unprecedented financial crash in 2022 brought months of consumer goods shortages, with inflation peaking at nearly 70 per cent that year. Since then, a $2.9 billion bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund, tax hikes and other austerity measures have slowly made headway in repairing the island’s economy. ‘Headline inflation will remain negative in the next few months, deeper than previously projected, mainly due to larger downward adjustments in energy prices and reduction in volatile food prices,’ Sri Lanka’s central bank said in a statement. The bank said inflation was likely to return to its target level of five percent in the coming months. Sri Lanka had already seen deflation of 0.8 per cent in October and 0.5 per cent in September.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/251644/sri-lanka-records-highest-deflation-since-1961

Blast at Kosovo canal a ‘terrorist attack’: Pristina,"An explosion on Friday damaged a canal supplying water to Kosovo’s two main coal-fired power plants, prime minister Albin Kurti said, blaming a ‘terrorist attack’ by neighbouring Serbia. ‘This is a criminal and terrorist attack aimed at damaging our critical infrastructure’, Kurti told a press conference late Friday. ‘The attack was carried out by professionals. We believe it comes from gangs directed by Serbia,’ he added without providing any evidence. The blast occurred near the town of Zubin Potok in the country’s troubled north, damaging a canal supplying water to cooling systems at two power plants that generate most of Kosovo’s electricity. Kurti gave no details about the extent of the damage, but said if it was not repaired part of Kosovo could be without electricity as soon as Saturday morning. Pictures from the scene published by local media showed water leaking heavily from one side of the reinforced canal, which runs from the Serb-majority north of Kosovo to the capital Pristina and also supplies drinking water. The United States strongly condemned the ‘attack on critical infrastructure in Kosovo’, the US embassy in Pristina said in a statement on Facebook. ‘We are monitoring the situation closely... and have offered our full support to the government of Kosovo to ensure that those responsible for this criminal attack are identified and held accountable.’ Animosity between ethnic Albanian-majority Kosovo and Serbia has persisted since the end of the war between Serbian forces and ethnic Albanian insurgents in the late 1990s. Kosovo declared independence in 2008, a move that Serbia has refused to acknowledge. Kurti’s government has for months sought to dismantle a parallel system of social services and political offices backed by Belgrade to serve Kosovo’s Serbs.

31 crew of Thai fishing vessels held in Myanmar,"More than 30 crew members of Thai fishing boats were detained in Myanmar waters on Saturday after an encounter with other vessels which left one person dead, a navy commander said. Suwat Donsakul, a naval commander in the southern province of Ranong, told AFP one Thai fisherman drowned and ‘31 people were taken into Myanmar’, without specifying who had detained them. Suwat said several Thai fishing boats were operating within Myanmar’s waters at the time of the incident on Saturday. The deceased ‘jumped into the water during the attack’, he said. Suwat said he had instructed local authorities to negotiate with their Myanmar counterparts to secure the release of the fishermen. A spokesperson for Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs told AFP that they would also engage in negotiations with the Myanmar side to secure their release. AFP has reached out to Myanmar’s junta government for comment. The incident prompted the Ranong provincial fisheries department to issue a warning to fishers and boat owners to avoid areas near the Thai-Myanmar maritime border. The fisheries department said in a statement that ‘Myanmar armed fishing boats’ had attacked Thai fishing vessels around 20 kilometres (12 miles) west of Phayam island, off the Thai coast, without specifying the identity of the alleged attackers. Its warning was to ‘all fishing operators and vessel owners to be cautious when navigating near the border’. Thailand and Myanmar share approximately 1,500 miles of land and maritime borders, including in the Andaman Sea. According to a notice on the website of Thailand’s fisheries department, Thai fishing boats have been illegally operating in Myanmar waters, raising tensions between the two countries.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/251639/31-crew-of-thai-fishing-vessels-held-in-myanmar
Syria rebels control ‘most of’ Aleppo city,"A monitor of Syria’s war said on Saturday that jihadist rebels now control a majority of Aleppo city, reporting Russian air strikes on parts of Syria’s second city for the first time since 2016. The rebels have pressed a lightning offensive against forces of the Iranian- and Russian-backed Syrian government since Wednesday, the same day a fragile ceasefire took effect in neighbouring Lebanon between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah group, a Damascus ally, after two months of all-out war. ‘Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied factions... took control of most of the city and government centres and prisons’, said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. HTS, a jihadist alliance led by Al-Qaeda’s former Syria branch, controls swathes of the Idlib region, in Syria’s northwest, as well as parts of neighbouring Aleppo, Hama and Latakia provinces. Overnight, Russian ‘warplanes launched raids on areas of Aleppo city for the first time since 2016’, added the Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria. It raised the death toll in days of clashes to 311 -- 183 from HTS and allied Turkish-backed factions, 100 soldiers and pro-government forces, as well as 28 civilians. State media reported that four civilians were killed when HTS shelled a student residence in Aleppo, a city of around two million people that was Syria’s pre-war manufacturing hub. Iran-backed militias have a heavy presence in the Aleppo region after providing crucial ground support when the Syrian army—backed by Russian air power—recaptured rebel-held areas of the city in 2016. An AFP correspondent saw rebels celebrating and cheering inside Aleppo late Friday. Another correspondent saw anti-government fighters in front of the city’s landmark citadel. The Observatory said that ‘the governor of Aleppo and the police and security branch commanders withdrew from the city centre’. The overnight air strikes coincided with ‘the arrival of large (rebel) military reinforcements’ to the area, the Observatory added, after on Friday reporting the jihadists and their allies had taken more than 50 towns and villages in the north. Army reinforcements have arrived in Aleppo, a Syrian security official told AFP on Friday, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, while an army statement said troops had repelled the assault on the city and retaken some positions. Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP early Saturday that rebel fighters swiftly captured swathes of Aleppo without meeting significant resistance, adding ‘there has been no fighting, not a single shot was fired, as regime forces withdrew.’ The jihadists and their allies made other advances in the north, including seizure of the strategically located town of Saraqib, on the road to Aleppo about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest, the Observatory had said. The Russian military said Friday it was bombing ‘extremist’ forces, as Turkey demanded a halt to bombardment on the Idlib region. Since 2020, the Idlib area has been subject to a Turkey and Russia-brokered truce which had largely been holding despite repeated violations.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/251638/syria-rebels-control-most-of-aleppo-city
India needs to address Bangladesh’s concerns: Touhid,"Foreign adviser Md Touhid Hossain on Saturday said that India needed to address Bangladesh’s longstanding concerns to improve bilateral ties between Dhaka and New Delhi. ‘Bangladesh’s previous government addressed the concerns of India, but India did not address Bangladesh’s concerns,’ he said while speaking at a roundtable titled ‘Bangladesh-India relations: expectations, barriers and future’. The South Asian Institute of Policy and Governance and the department of political science and sociology of North South University hosted the event on its campus in Dhaka. ‘There has been no progress on crucial issues between Bangladesh and India such as the Teesta water-sharing agreement or the troubling problem of border killings,’ Touhid said. ‘Such incidents do not occur along the borders of other countries unless there is a state of war,’ he said adding that India had to take responsibility for these issues. ‘If individuals commit crimes, they might be prosecuted in court, but shouldn’t be killed,’ the adviser added. Touhid also raised concerns about an aggressive media campaign in India against Bangladesh, especially since August 5, noting that such rhetoric was detrimental to fostering healthy relations between the two nations. ‘In such a complex relationship, our [Bangladesh] media has a key role to play in fact-checking and providing accurate coverage, especially regarding statements from our foreign ministry,’ he said. Despite current diplomatic challenges, the adviser expressed optimism about the future of Bangladesh-India relations accepting the reality in the context of the post-August 5 changed situation. ‘There is a change in the relations after August 5. This is reality,’ he said. ‘However, Dhaka wants to remain optimistic that we would be able to establish a good relation with India making sure that bilateral interests are protected.’ Touhid emphasised the importance of a national consensus on foreign policy, saying that Bangladesh could not fully capitalise its potentials due to political divisions. The adviser also highlighted the need to enhance the country’s national capacity, particularly through the development of human resources. Bangladeshi workers in the Middle Eastern countries earned significantly less than their Indian counterparts. That was due to a lack of skills and poor proficiency in English, he explained. Vice-chairman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party SM Asaduzzaman Ripon, joint member secretary of the AB Party Asaduzzaman Fuaad, former diplomat Saquib Ali, former principal staff officer of the armed forces division lieutenant general (retired) Mohammad Mahfuzur Rahman, vice-chancellor of Manarat International University professor Mohammad Abdur Rob attended the roundtable as panel discussants. NSU vice-chancellor professor Abdul Hannan Chowdhury was in chair while M Jashim Uddin, associate professor of the department of political science and sociology acted as the moderator.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/251633/india-needs-to-address-bangladeshs-concerns-touhid
"Las Palmas stun Barca on 125th anniversary, Atletico rout Valladolid","Las Palmas claimed a surprise 2-1 victory at La Liga leaders Barcelona on Saturday, spoiling the hosts' 125th anniversary celebrations. Atletico Madrid climbed provisionally second, within two points of Hansi Flick's side with a 5-0 rout of Real Valladolid later on. Sandro Ramirez sent Las Palmas ahead early in the second half and although Raphinha hammered home an equaliser, Fabio Silva struck to claim three points and take his team up to 14th. Barcelona still lead champions Real Madrid by four points but third-place Los Blancos, who host Getafe on Sunday, have played two fewer games than the Catalans and Atletico. Barca have now gone three league games without a victory, after a run of 11 wins in 12 prior in the top flight. ‘We had a bad game, we have to look at what we're doing badly to try and improve and win games,’ Raphinha told Movistar. ‘I don't care about my goal, I care about winning, we didn't win and I'm not satisfied with the game.’ Barcelona wore white shorts as part of their anniversary celebrations, as they used to back at the start of their history. They held a gala in the city on Friday night to mark the occasion, having been founded on November 29, 1899, but came undone on Saturday afternoon. ‘We have to (play) like we did at the beginning of the season... it's a big disappointment today,’ Flick told reporters. ‘Today we have more than 70 percent ball possession but we're not able to score the goals -- maybe we have to change one or two things. ‘We made some mistakes, but it was not the back four, it starts (with the players) in front, we have to speak about that.’ The Catalans were able to name teenage starlet Lamine Yamal on the bench after recovering from an ankle problem. Raphinha came closest to breaking the deadlock in the first half, scoring from an offside position and hitting the crossbar after being played through by Gavi. Flick threw on Yamal at the break, hoping the winger would give Barca the advantage after an even first half. Las Palmas took a surprise lead early in the second half when Kirian Rodriguez played in Ramirez, who drilled home from the edge of the box. Raphinha hit back quickly for Barcelona with a thumping long-range effort, but Las Palmas were soon ahead again. Silva ran onto Munoz's probing long ball and fired past Inaki Pena to restore the Canary Islanders' advantage with his fifth goal in eight league matches. Former Barca goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen made several good saves and Las Palmas survived eight minutes of stoppage time. ‘It was a very important win, we worked hard for it, Barca put you under a lot of pressure,’ midfielder Moleiro told Movistar after Las Palmas sealed their first away win at Barcelona since 1971. Atletico Madrid romped to a five-star victory at bottom side Real Valladolid, with Antoine Griezmann scoring one of the goals of the season. Diego Simeone's team have won seven consecutive games across all competitions and moved two points clear of champions Real Madrid. Clement Lenglet opened the scoring after 25 minutes and Julian Alvarez added the second. Rodrigo de Paul swept home the third before half-time and Griezmann produced a wonderful turn and finish soon after the break to add the fourth on a memorable night for the Rojiblancos, which even some home fans applauded. Alexander Sorloth wrapped up Atletico's thumping victory in stoppage time. Griezmann's goal saw the French forward exchange passes with Alvarez before executing a sensational turn and beating goalkeeper Karl Hein with a delicate touch. ‘I have to thank (the Valladolid fans), in the end it's what all players want, we want people to enjoy it with us, whether it's opposition fans or our own,’ Griezmann told DAZN. ‘In the end I have to be grateful for this love, I'm doing really well and I hope to give more.’ Atletico beat Sparta Prague 6-0 in the Champions League on Tuesday, meaning Simeone's side scored 11 goals this week without reply. ‘There are always things to improve, the team is always looking to do better,’ Simeone told DAZN. ‘We have to keep our humility, the nobility of keeping on looking for more... in the second half we could have done more... but I'll stick with what the team's giving me, with humility you can do anything.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/251630/las-palmas-stun-barca-on-125th-anniversary-atletico-rout-valladolid

Bangladesh hold mighty Malaysia in Muscat,"Bangladesh Under-21 hockey team came from a goal down to hold Malaysia to a 2-2 draw in their third Pool B match of the Men’s Junior Asia Cup 2024 at the Al Amerat Hockey Stadium in Muscat, Oman, on Saturday. Bangladesh began their campaign with a 3-1 victory over Oman before losing 6-0 to Pakistan in their second encounter. This was Bangladesh's first point against Malaysia in their three meetings in this competition, following 8-0 and 5-1 losses in 2015 and 2023.

"India’s double standard condemnable, objectionable: Asif Nazrul","Law adviser Asif Nazrul has said that India’s double standard is both condemnable and objectionable. Asif Nazrul made the remark in a post on his verified Facebook page on Friday. The post says that India’s unwarranted concern for Bangladesh continues. But on India’s own soil numerous incidents of atrocities are perpetrated against the Muslim minority. The country is neither mortified nor remorseful about it. This double standard of India is both condemnable and objectionable. ‘Most people in Bangladesh [64.1 per cent] believe that the interim government is providing more security to the country’s minority community than the previous Awami League government,’ he said, adding that this was revealed in a Voice of America Bangla survey published on Thursday. ‘We have also seen for ourselves how the people of Bangladesh, including student organisations, madrassahs and political parties, worked for the security of minorities during the recent Durga Puja,’ he said. ‘Most recently, after the brutal and provocative killing of lawyer Saiful Islam in Chattogram, Muslims in Bangladesh have shown immense restraint and patience,’ he added. He said that even then, India’s unwanted concern over the situation in Bangladesh had not stopped. ‘Numerous atrocities against the minority Muslim community continue to occur on India's own soil. Yet they have no mortification or remorse about it,’ he said. On November 26, lawyer Saiful was hacked to death amid clashes among law enforcers, agitated protesters, and supporters of Chinmoy Krishna Das on a Chattogram court premises following the denial of his bail petition in a sedition case.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/251622/indias-double-standard-condemnable-objectionable-asif-nazrul
Dhaka hopeful to establish good ties with Delhi in current situation,"Amid intensified diplomatic tensions between the two neighbours, foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain on Saturday said that they expected to establish a good relationship with India accepting the reality in the context of the post-August 5 changed situation. ‘We want to remain optimistic that we would be able to establish a good relationship with India making sure that bilateral interests are protected,’ he said. The adviser was speaking at a roundtable titled Bangladesh-India Relations: Expectations, Barriers and Future. The South Asian Institute of Policy and Governance and the Department of Political Science and Sociology, North South University hosted the event at the syndicate hall of NSU. Touhid Hossain said Bangladesh had some concerns and there are still some concerns that remain unaddressed while the previous government tried to address the concerns of India. He believes that India will proceed realising the changed situation but acknowledged that there are barriers which are normal in any relationship. ‘There is a change in the relations after August 5. This is reality.’ The panelists of the roundtable were Barrister Asaduzzaman Fuaad, joint member secretary, AB Party, Saquib Ali, former diplomat, Lieutenant General (retd) Mohammad Mahfuzur Rahman, former principal staff officer, Armed Forces Division, Professor Mohammad Abdur Rob, vice-chancellor, Manarat International University, and SM Asaduzzaman Ripon, vice chairman, Bangladesh Nationalist Party.

South Africa thrash Sri Lanka to fuel World Test Championship bid,"South Africa's chances of reaching the World Test Championship final received a boost when they completed a 233-run over Sri Lanka on the fourth day of the first Test at Kingsmead on Saturday. The result lifted South Africa to second place in the WTC table, which is calculated on average points earned. With their remaining three matches to be played at home – the second Test against Sri Lanka followed by two against Pakistan – South Africa are well-placed to qualify for the final at Lord's in London next June if they carry on winning. ‘That's always been one of our goals as a team,’ said South African captain Temba Bavuma. ‘The conversation has always been there. We've not been loud about it but that conversation will probably become more alive now.’ Set a massive 516 runs to win, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 282. Left-arm fast bowler Marco Jansen, the destroyer in Sri Lanka's record-low first innings of 42, took four for 73 to finish with match figures of 11 for 86. He was named player of the match. Bavuma said conditions had changed considerably during the match, in which South Africa battled to make 191 in the first innings before Sri Lanka were blown away in 13.5 overs, with Jansen taking seven for 13. ‘We were in a tough position and we knew we had to dig deep,’ said Bavuma. ‘We were quite confident that if they could put us under pressure with the ball we could do the same to them. ‘We weren't expecting things to go so quickly but we knew the conditions (for bowling) were in our favour and that we could exploit them.’ Referring to the Test championship, Bavuma said his team needed to continue to focus internally on what they needed to do, rather than be concerned about factors beyond their control. Sri Lankan captain Dhananjaya de Silva said the first innings had been decisive – ‘our bowling as well as our batting.’ He said Sri Lanka could have bowled better to restrict South Africa to around 120, although he paid tribute to Bavuma, who scored 70 in the first innings and 113 in the second. The collapse to 42 all out against a ‘brilliant’ Jansen happened so quickly, he said, that ‘we didn't have time to think. We had better plans in the second innings.’ In contrast to the first innings, the tourists made the South Africans work for their wickets on Saturday. Dinesh Chandimal (83) and De Silva (59) put on 95 for the sixth wicket and kept South Africa in the field for most of the morning after resuming at 103 for five. The breakthrough for South Africa came when De Silva chipped a catch to midwicket off left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj. Kusal Mendis made an attacking 48 before he became Jansen's 10th victim of the match. The second Test starts at Gqeberha on Thursday.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251620/south-africa-thrash-sri-lanka-to-fuel-world-test-championship-bid

Chelsea not in Premier League title race: Maresca,"Enzo Maresca does not believe his Chelsea side are in the Premier League title race despite an impressive start to the season in his first campaign at Stamford Bridge. Victory over Aston Villa on Sunday would be a seventh in 13 league games under the Italian, who was appointed as Mauricio Pochettino's successor in June. Ahead of the weekend action, Chelsea were third in the table, level on 22 points with Arsenal and Brighton, a point behind Manchester City and nine points adrift of leaders Liverpool. Chelsea are in the hunt to return to the Champions League after two seasons away and Maresca has fashioned an effective team from a bloated squad. But the Italian, 44, was keen to play down suggestions that the Blues could be the team to end Manchester City's four-year title streak this season. ‘No,’ he said when asked whether they were in the title race. ‘I said many times I didn't like the pressure. I didn't like to say 'Yes we are there', but we are not there. ‘Arsenal are ahead of us, City is ahead of us, Liverpool showing they are ahead of us. The important thing is we improve game after game and then we will see. ‘For me, it is not about points or the table, it is about the process and the programme. Five years together (Arsenal), nine together (City). Liverpool is different but they didn't make too many changes from before. It's not about the points difference on the table, it is about the time together.’ Liverpool and City are meeting on Sunday, giving Chelsea the chance to make up ground on the teams above them but Maresca urged caution. ‘You have to be realistic,’ said Maresca. ‘You can see the difference between us and the rest in this moment. It doesn't mean we are not going to compete and win games. We will do that to the end. The main focus has to be the feeling we are improving game after game.’ ",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/251618/chelsea-not-in-premier-league-title-race-maresca
Van Nistelrooy appointed Leicester manager,"Leicester named Ruud van Nistelrooy as the club's new manager on Friday, just weeks after his departure from Manchester United. The Dutchman left United earlier this month after a short spell as interim boss and previously serving as assistant to Erik ten Hag. Leicester sacked Steve Cooper on Sunday after just 12 Premier League games in charge, with the Foxes 16th in the table and only one point above the relegation zone. ‘I'm proud, I'm excited. Everybody that I speak to about Leicester City Football Club is enthusiastic,’ said Van Nistelrooy in a club statement. ‘The recent history of the club is impressive. I'm excited to start and to get to know everyone and give everything I can for the football club.’ Leicester shocked the world to win the Premier League in 2015/16 and lifted the FA Cup for the first time five years later. But they were relegated from the top tier two years ago before bouncing back at the first attempt under now Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca. Two of Van Nistelrooy's three wins in four games as United's caretaker manager came against Leicester in the League Cup and Premier League. The 48-year-old has previous managerial experience from one year in charge of PSV Eindhoven in 2022/23. He will not begin his role until Sunday, leaving a caretaker team led by Ben Dawson to take charge of Saturday's visit to Brentford, but Van Nistelrooy will attend the game. A prolific goalscorer, Van Nistelrooy enjoyed a glorious playing career, most notably at PSV, Manchester United and Real Madrid. Leicester chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha said: ‘Ruud's experience, knowledge, and winning mentality will undoubtedly bring great value to us, and we look forward to supporting him in achieving success for our fans and our club.’",https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/251617/van-nistelrooy-appointed-leicester-manager

England on verge of wrapping up first New Zealand Test,"A sustained seam attack by Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse following a belligerent batting effort saw England on the verge of wrapping up the first Test at stumps on day three in Christchurch on Saturday. New Zealand were 155-6 at the close, ahead by just four runs and with only four wickets remaining. Daryl Mitchell was not out 31 with Nathan Smith on one. England made 499 in their first innings, an imposing 151-run lead, led by Harry Brook's 171. ‘We're in an amazing position to go on and win the game,’ said Brook, who benefitted from five dropped catches. ‘I had a lot of luck, didn't I. and thankfully I cashed in.’ New Zealand were hurting at the fielding errors with Brook adding 153 after he was first dropped on 18. ‘Fielding's something we pride ourselves on and that's the part that hurts,’ said seamer Matt Henry. ‘We work hard on it and it's usually where we turn a game on its head. So obviously it hurts when chances go down.’ Brook's knock was supported by 80 from captain Ben Stokes and 77 from Ollie Pope. It was then the turn of England's seamers as New Zealand's salvage attempt faltered at the start with Tom Latham caught by Brook for one to give Woakes his first wicket in the third over. Devon Conway was on eight when his attempt to pull Carse to the boundary was miscued to Gus Atkinson at mid-on and New Zealand were tottering at 23-2. Kane Williamson and Rachin Ravindra set about stitching the innings together as they put on 41 for the third wicket before Ravindra went for 24. The left-hander could not resist pulling a short ball from Carse but failed to get on top of the bounce and was caught by Jacob Bethell waiting at mid-wicket. Woakes returned to remove Williamson and Tom Blundell in successive balls to end the day with 3-39. Williamson, so often called upon to rescue his country, was unruffled until on 61 -- his second half-century of the Test -- he missed a straight delivery and was trapped lbw. With his next ball, Woakes found the faintest edge of Blundell's bat but he was denied a hat-trick by Glenn Phillips who pushed a short ball towards the covers. Phillips progressed to 19 before he was given out lbw to a Carse delivery that nipped back. New Zealand sought a review but replays showed the ball was skimming the bails and the decision was the umpires call and Carse had 3-22. England resumed the day at 319-5 and raced along at six an over before being all out after lunch. A masterful Brook, who benefitted from five of the eight catches spilled by New Zealand, led England's rescue after they were left reeling at 71-4. The only good news for New Zealand was that while they dropped two more catches on day three, they successfully held five. Brook relished his lives. He smiled and looked to the heavens when Phillips spilled a chance on 147, having been dropped the previous day on 18, 41, 70 and 106. Four overs after his last reprieve, he brought up his 150 in imperious fashion, charging down the wicket at Tim Southee and driving him to the cover boundary. But when New Zealand found a way to make catches stick, Brook's innings, which included 15 fours and three sixes, came to an end. A good length ball from Matt Henry found a faint outside edge and wicketkeeper Blundell grasped the opportunity. The applause as Brook left the ground was as much for New Zealand holding a catch as it was for a magnificent innings. Woakes (one) was out on the second ball he faced with Latham scooping up a low-level chance at second slip. Smith ended Atkinson's breezy innings with Phillips taking a smart catch at long leg. Henry was the most successful New Zealand bowler with 4-84. Smith took 3-141.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251615/england-on-verge-of-wrapping-up-first-new-zealand-test
BNP iterates call for vigilance over recent incidents,"The Bangladesh Nationalist Party on Saturday called for a thorough review of the recent incidents, alleging that they were occurring behind the facade of religion, and urged all to remain vigilant. ‘We must look deeply into the incidents happening in the name of religion. We need to be alert,’ BNP standing committee member Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury said at the 7th National Council of Gonoforum, held at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh. Referring to recent developments in Chattogram and other parts of the country, the BNP standing committee member expressed his concern, terming the incidents totally unexpected. Those who had not taken to the streets in the past 16 years were now staging demonstrations, he said, adding that other driving forces were behind them, and it should not be ignored. Highlighting the challenges facing the country, Khasru stressed that moving towards a vision of a democratic and peaceful Bangladesh was imperative at the moment. ‘We need to take the country to the place we have always dreamt of. In the past, when this vision was not pursued, it gave rise to monsters. The only way forward is through a peaceful transfer of power,’ he said. Khasru reiterated the need for democracy for restoring people’s ownership over the country. He also pointed out that his party’s 31-point state reform outline was a significant contribution to future governance. The BNP leader assured that after the next election and formation of a national government, implementation of the 31-point reform plan would be prioritised. ‘There is no need for others to worry about reforms,’ Khasru said, adding that the focus should be on electoral reforms to ensure the country’s return to its rightful owners—the people.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/251614/bnp-iterates-call-for-vigilance-over-recent-incidents
Bangladesh women cruise to ODI series win over Ireland,"Bangladesh women put on a collective performance as they beat their Irish counterparts by five wickets in the second ODI to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Saturday. Chasing a target of 194 to win, the hosts cruised to 197-5 with 37 balls to spare. This was their third-highest successful run chase overall, highest at home and against Ireland. Captain Nigar Sultana Joty played a key role in the middle-order with her 40 off 39 while opener Fargana Haque hit her second consecutive fifty, with Sharmin Akter and Sharna Akter all contributing after the bowlers restricted Ireland to 193-6. For Joty, securing two points in the ICC women's championship was more important than the series victory, but the win was a testament to their hard work. ‘These cricketers have been working hard for a long time. When you can’t win, there’s negativity around. But a win is huge for the team,’ Joty, who was adjudged as the player of the match, told reporters after the win. Opting to bat first, Ireland lost both openers cheaply as the spin duo Nahida Akter and Sultana Khatun struck each. Amy Hunter and Orla Prendergast then put on a 91-run partnership for the third wicket to give Ireland a foundation. But they fell in consecutive overs. Prendergast (37) was run out while Hunter was trapped lbw by part-timer Sharna after making 68 off 88 balls. Una Raymond-Hoey’s 18-ball 21 and Laura Delany’s 33 then lifted Ireland close to 200. But Joty admitted that their bowling could’ve been better. Seven bowlers were used by her, with Sultana Khatun grabbing two wickets while Nahida and Sharna took one wicket apiece. In chase, Bangladesh wobbled twice. First when Murshida Khatun fell at the beginning. But Fargana and Sharmin—the stars of the previous match—added 85 runs for the second wicket to steady the ship. Fargana fell after making 50 off 89—her 12th half-century; Sharmin followed her with seven shy of her milestone. Bangladesh wobbled a bit again, but a timely innings from Joty with the help of Sharna (29*) and Sobhana Mostary (16) saw them home. Batting was the main concern for Bangladesh leading into the series, but they stood up in the first two matches. Joty believed that the most important part of the game was to maintain consistency. ‘Today [Saturday] morning, the message I gave to the cricketers was that to be consistent is the key. We should repeat the batting performance of the first match,’ she said. ‘Consistency is important. We lost many matches due to our batting failures. From that point, batters getting runs is a relief. But the question remains: whether we could repeat that in the next match. That challenge remains.’ The third and final ODI will be held at the same venue on Monday. After that, both teams will move to Sylhet, where they will compete in a three-match T20I series starting on December 5.

Stay Warm This Winter: Geysers and Water Heaters in High Demand Across Bangladesh,"As winter approaches, families across Bangladesh are rushing to purchase geysers and water heaters to combat the seasonal chill. Here's what you need to know about this growing trend. With the winter season just around the corner, the demand forgeysers and water heatersis surging across Bangladesh. Retailers report a noticeable increase in sales as families prepare to make their homes winter-ready. For many, access to hot water has become a necessity rather than a luxury, particularly in regions where temperatures dip significantly during this time of year. “Every year, we see a spike in demand from late November onward,”said a retailer at Dhaka’s popular Katabon electronics market.“People are more proactive now, especially as winter temperatures have been harsher in recent years.” In colder regions like Rangpur, Dinajpur, and Sylhet, winter temperatures can drop to as low as 6–8°C, making daily tasks like bathing and cleaning a challenge without warm water. Hot water has become an essential part of maintaining health and hygiene during the winter months, particularly for children and elderly family members who are more vulnerable to the cold. As a result, many families now consider geysers a vitalhome appliance, not just a convenience. Bangladesh’s market for geysers and water heaters is diverse, with options catering to households of all sizes and budgets. Popular choices include electric storage geysers, instant water heaters, and gas-powered models. The price of geysers in Bangladesh varies depending on the type, capacity, and brand. Leading retailers likeStar Techoffer a range of options, including popular brands like Shameem Tropica, Midea, and Haier, catering to different customer needs. These brands are recognized for their durability and energy efficiency, offering solutions for both budget-conscious buyers and those looking for premium models. Mid-range water heaters are priced between ৳9,000 and ৳15,000, while more advanced electric storage geyser models can reach up to ৳100,000. International brands like Ariston and Rheem are also sought after by customers who prioritize advanced features and long-term reliability. Popular capacities for electric storage geysers typically range from 10 liters to 50 liters, with 30-liter models being the most common choice for small to medium-sized families. Retailers like Star Tech are making sure that there is a variety of options to suit every budget, providing customers with a wide selection to choose from as they prepare for the winter season. Rising electricity costs have made energy efficiency a key consideration for buyers. Appliances with higher energy ratings may have a higher upfront cost but result in significant savings over time. Smart water heaters with features like IoT connectivity and programmable timers are also gaining popularity. These devices allow users to control the heater remotely, schedule heating cycles, and monitor energy consumption through smartphone apps. “Smart geysers are a game-changer as they’re convenient and help consumers to save energy and money, which is a win-win.”, said a technician from an electronics service center in Dhaka. To ensure long-lasting performance, experts recommend regular maintenance of geysers and water heaters. Sediment buildup in storage tanks can reduce efficiency, so it’s essential to flush the tank every few months. Other tips include insulating water pipes to minimize heat loss, turning off the heater when not in use, and routinely checking safety features like the thermostat and pressure valves. “Proper maintenance can extend the lifespan of a geyser by several years,”said an engineer from a local repair shop.“It also ensures the appliance runs safely and efficiently.” With the winter chill fast approaching, households across the country are prioritizing their preparations. From warm clothing to reliable water heaters, families are taking every measure to stay comfortable during the colder months. “Bangladesh’s winters may not be as harsh as in some countries, but they still demand lifestyle adjustments, moreover nowadays geysers are as essential as a warm blanket for many of us.” said a homeowner in Mymensingh. For those considering a geyser or water heater, now is the time to buy. With options available for every budget, it’s easier than ever to ensure your family’s comfort this winter.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/miscellany1/251612/stay-warm-this-winter-geysers-and-water-heaters-in-high-demand-across-bangladesh
Citizens want service-oriented police force,"Discussants at a seminar in Dhaka on Saturday said that the Bangladesh Police needed a comprehensive reform plan to overcome the negative image the force had achieved in the past 16 years. They said that structural legal reform was crucial to transform the police into a service-oriented force. Non-government organisation Humanity Foundation hosted the discussion at the Centre on Integrated Rural Development for Asia and the Pacific auditorium in Dhaka, said a press release. Former inspector general of police Mohammad Nurul Huda said that political will was crucial to make police reform effective. He suggested that personnel on deputation from other forces should undergo at least six months of police training before joining any police unit. Golam Rasul, a former deputy inspector general of police and a member of the police reform commission, suggested exploring the feasibility of establishing a separate police commission outside the Bangladesh Civil Service framework. Former DIG Mesbahun Nabi blamed the lack of good governance for the lack of quality policing, noting that extrajudicial killings started with the induction of personnel from other forces. Lawyer Muhammad Shafiqul Rahman criticised the absence of public discourse on police reforms, stating that even protests or human chains addressing the issue are rare. Chaired by the foundation’s chairman, Muhammad Shafiqul Rahman, former Supreme Court registrar and district judge Ikhtedar Ahmed, former chair of the Department of History at Jahangirnagar University professor Mohammad Mujahidul Islam, vice-chancellor of Global University professor Anisuzzaman, former police officer Mazharul Haque, a central leader of Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh maulana Monir Hossain Qasemi,  Rashtra Sanskar Andolon leader Zakia Shishir, among others, also participated in the discussion.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251611/citizens-want-service-oriented-police-force
BCL burns Yunus’ photo after brief procession,"Leaders and activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student organisation of the Awami League, on Saturday brought out a brief procession in the Patuakhali town. The procession of the banned student organization began at Thanapara in the town at about 6:00am. It was allegedly led by Adnan Habib Khan, deputy relief secretary of the central committee of the organisation, and Aminur Rahman Sifat Khan, former assistant secretary of the district BCL. The procession ended in front of the Patuakhali Press Club, where the processionists demonstrated by setting fire to a photo of the chief adviser, Professor Muhammad Yunus. The processionists later circulated it on their Facebook. The district unit of the Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, held a protest rally in the town in protest at this flash procession. Later, JCD district senior joint convener Al Amin Howlader led a procession that started from in front of Patuakhali Government College. The procession ended in front of the Sadar police station after parading main roads of the town. The protesters blocked the road in front of the police station, demanding immediate arrest of the BCL leaders and activists. Patuakhali Sadar police station officer-in-charge Md Imtiaz Ahmed said that the situation was brought under control. ‘I have heard about the procession. Legal action will be taken against the BCL people after identifying them,’ he added.

13 more killed in Pakistan sectarian clash,"Sectarian feuding in northwest Pakistan killed 13 more people, a local government official said Saturday, as warring Sunnis and Shiites defied repeated ceasefire orders in recent conflict claiming 124 lives. Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country, but Kurram district — in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, near the border with Afghanistan — has a large Shiite population and the communities have clashed for decades. Fresh fighting broke out last Thursday when two separate convoys of Shiite Muslims travelling under police escort were ambushed, killing more than 40. Since then 10 days of fighting with light and heavy weapons has brought the region to a standstill, with major roads closed and mobile phone services cut as the death toll surged. A Kurram local government official put the death toll at 124 on Saturday after 13 more people were killed in the past two days. Two were Sunni and 11 Shiite, he said, whilst more than 50 people have been wounded in fresh fighting which continued Saturday morning. ‘There is a severe lack of trust between the two sides, and neither tribe is willing to comply with government orders to cease hostilities,’ he told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. ‘Police report that many people want to flee the area due to the violence, but the deteriorating security situation makes it impossible,’ he added. A seven-day ceasefire deal was announced by the provincial government last weekend but failed to hold. Another 10-day truce was brokered Wednesday but it also failed to stymie the fighting. A senior security official in the provincial capital of Peshawar, also speaking anonymously, confirmed the total death toll of 124. ‘There is a fear of more fatalities,’ he said. ‘None of the provincial government’s initiated measures have been fully implemented to restore peace.’ Police have regularly struggled to control violence in Kurram, which was part of the semi-autonomous Federally Administered Tribal Areas until it was merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2018. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said 79 people had been killed in the region between July and October in sectarian clashes. The feuding is generally rekindled by disputes over land in the rugged mountainous region, and fuelled by underlying tensions between the communities adhering to different sects of Islam.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/251609/13-more-killed-in-pakistan-sectarian-clash
Murder case filed as protests on over killing of lawyer on Ctg court premises,"Four days after lawyer Saiful Islam Alif had been hacked to death in Chattogram, a murder case was filed with the Kotwali police against 31 named and 10–15 unidentified people early Saturday amid protest demanding justice for the killing. The victim’s father Jamal Uddin filed the murder case. Saiful’s elder brother Khane Alam filed another case with the same police station over attacks and vandalism carried out on a Chattogram court premises  against 116 named individuals and 400–500 unnamed people, said Chattogram Metropolitan Police additional deputy commissioner Kazi Md Tarek Aziz. With these two, five cases had been filed so far over the murder of assistant public prosecutor in Chattogram Saiful Islam Alif near court premises and clashes between members of law enforcement agencies and followers of Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote spokesperson Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari on November 26. The killing and clashes happened when the police was taking Chinmoy Krishna Das, arrested in a sedition case to jail under a court order. Saiful’s family filed two cases and police filed three, all leading to, so far, arrest of 38 people, including nine allegedly identified for killing the lawyer. In Dhaka city on Saturday morning, Bangladesh Krishi Bank Jatiyatabadi Forum held a rally in front of the bank’s head office in Motijheel area, protesting at the killing. Speakers at the rally alleged that ousted fascist Awami League government killed the lawyer in a planned way to spark anarchy. The named accused in the murder case include Chandan, Aman Das, Shuvo Kanti Das, Bunja, Ranab, Bidhan, Bikash, Ramit, Rumit Das, Nayan Das, Gagan Das, Vishal Das, Omkar Das, Vishal, Rajkapur, Lala, Samir, Sohel Das, Shiv Kumar, Biglal, Parash, Ganesh, Om Das, Poppy, Ajay, Devi Charan, Dev, Joy, Durlav Das, Rajib Bhattacharya, all reportedly residents of the Bandel Road Sebak Colony under the city’s Kotwali police, according to the case documents. When the court ordered Chinmoy Krishna Das to be sent to jail rejecting his bail plea, his lawyers became agitated, made offensive remarks targeting the court, and caused chaos on the premises, the case statement said. Chinmoy followers blocked the prison van for about two–three hours, and when members of police, Border Guard Bangladesh and Ansar tried to disperse them, they created chaos chanting provocative slogans and vandalised 20–30 vehicles, the case statement added. Later that day, around 4:30pm, the accused allegedly targeted Alif due to his beard and attacked him with sharp weapons leaving marks in 21–22 places of his body. In the case statement, Alif’s father also alleged that after speaking with witnesses and his son’s colleagues, he discovered that the murder was carried out with direct and indirect instigation from leaders and activists associated with the Chhatra League, Juba League, Awami League, and other organisations affiliated to it. The lawyers’ death sparked protests in Dhaka and Chattogram as elsewhere in the country demanding justice and also a ban on ISKCON in Bangladesh. Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari was formerly a leader of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, ISKCON in short. Three leaders of banned student organisation Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of the Awami League, meanwhile were arrested on Saturday in a case filed over vandalising a temple run by the ISKCON in Kishoreganj’s Bhairab. The arrested are Chhatra League Bhairab municipality unit joint general secretary Hasibul Hasan, library affairs secretary Md Sanjib and Bhairab upazila unit joint general secretary Md Pranto. Bhairab police officer-in-charge Md Shahin said that the incident occurred at ‘Sri Sri Hare Krishna Namhatta Sangha’ at Ranibazar Haludpatti in the upazila Friday afternoon. ‘We have so far arrested three suspects in connection with the incident. They are Chhatra League leaders,’ he said. Pranay Karmakar, a resident of the Tinpatti area of the town, filed the case with the Bhairab police against unidentified people, he said. At 5:00pm, 15–20 people attacked the temple with sticks, the case statement said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251608/murder-case-filed-as-protests-on-over-killing-of-lawyer-on-ctg-court-premises

"China imprisons journalist on espionage charges, says family","A Beijing court on Friday sentenced veteran Chinese state media journalist Dong Yuyu to seven years in prison on espionage charges, his family said. Dong, a senior columnist at the Communist Party newspaper Guangming Daily, was detained in February 2022 along with a Japanese diplomat at a Beijing restaurant. The diplomat was released after a few hours of questioning, but Dong, 62, was charged with spying last year. ‘The Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People’s Court convicted Yuyu of espionage, a crime that requires that the prosecution prove that the defendant knowingly acted on behalf of ‘espionage organisations’ and their agents,’ according to a statement shared by his family with AFP. According to the judgement, the Japanese diplomats Dong met with, including then-ambassador Hideo Tarumi and current Shanghai-based chief diplomat Masaru Okada, were named as agents of an ‘espionage organisation’, the family statement added. ‘We are shocked that the Chinese authorities would blatantly deem a foreign embassy as an ‘espionage organisation’ and accuse the former Japanese ambassador and his fellow diplomats of being spies,’ Dong’s family said. On Friday, Beijing’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning responded to Dong’s case by saying ‘China is a country ruled by law’. The Japanese embassy told AFP that it would not comment directly on the case. But an embassy spokesperson told AFP in an email: ‘The diplomatic activities of Japanese diplomatic missions abroad are carried out in a legitimate manner.’ In Washington, State Department Spokesman Matthew Miller condemned Dong’s jailing and called for his immediate release. ‘His arrest and today’s sentencing highlight the PRC’s failure to live up to its commitments under international law and its own constitutional guarantees to all its citizens, which include the right to freedom of speech and freedom of the press,’ Miller said in a statement referring to China by its official name, the People’s Republic of China. The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the ‘unjust verdict’ and called for Dong’s immediate release. ‘Interacting with diplomats is part of a journalist’s job,’ the NGO’s Asia program coordinator Beh Lih Yi said in an email to AFP. ‘This sentencing cements China’s position as the world’s leading jailer of journalists,’ added Yi. Under Chinese law, a person convicted of espionage can be jailed for three to 10 years for less severe cases or receive heavy punishment, including life imprisonment, for serious cases. Dong’s work has been published in the Chinese editions of The New York Times and the Financial Times. He won the prestigious Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University in 2006-2007. He was also a visiting fellow at Keio University in Japan in 2010 and a visiting professor at Hokkaido University in 2014. Civil liberties and freedom of expression have dramatically receded in China under President Xi Jinping’s decade-long tenure. The Communist Party maintains tight restrictions on domestic media outlets, and Chinese nationals who work with foreign outlets are routinely harassed. China is the worst country for jailing media workers with 44 journalists behind bars as of December last year, according to a CPJ ranking. In February, a Beijing court handed a suspended death sentence to jailed dissident writer Yang Hengjun after finding the dual Chinese-Australian citizen guilty on espionage charges.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/251606/china-imprisons-journalist-on-espionage-charges-says-family

Dhaka becomes 5th most polluted city with AQI score of 168,"Dhaka has ranked fifth on the list of cities worldwide with the worst air quality with an AQI score of 168 at 9:00am on Saturday morning. Dhaka’s air was classified as ‘unhealthy’ on Saturday, according to the air quality index. India’s Delhi, Pakistan’s Lahore, Vietnam’s Hanoi and Kazakhstan’s Astana occupied the first, second, third and fourth spots on the list with AQI scores of 475, 263, 194 and 192, respectively. When the AQI value for particle pollution is between 101 and 150, air quality is considered ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’, between 150 and 200 is ‘unhealthy’, between 201 and 300 is said to be ‘very unhealthy’, while a reading of 301 and above is considered ‘hazardous’, posing serious health risks to residents. The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. The AQI in Bangladesh is based on five pollutants — particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon. As per World Health Organisation, air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, mainly due to increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/environment-climate-change/251603/dhaka-becomes-5th-most-polluted-city-with-aqi-score-of-168
Hamas representatives to hold ceasefire talks in Cairo,"Hamas representatives will go to Cairo on Saturday for talks on a possible ceasefire in Gaza, an official in the Palestinian militant group told AFP on Friday. ‘A Hamas delegation will go to Cairo tomorrow for several meetings with Egyptian officials to discuss ideas for a ceasefire and a prisoner accord in the Gaza Strip,’ the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic. The announcement came two days after a ceasefire went into effect between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollah, a Hamas ally. The United States has also announced a new diplomatic effort with Qatar, Turkey and Egypt to reach a Gaza ceasefire and the release of hostages.

The October 7, 2023 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,207 people, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. The only ceasefire so far, in November 2023, saw the release of about 100 hostages by Hamas and its allies in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

Ramna park hours cut further,"Ramna park hours have been shortened further as two schedules have been enforced by separate government departments for public entry. The two schedules have significantly reduced public access to the 68.50-acre park located in the heart of the capital, causing confusion and dissatisfactions among the public who feel that their right to open spaces has been denied. The Public Works Department has ordered closure of the park from 12 noon to 2:00pm for everyday maintenance and cleaning since 2022, a decision made after the park reopened following Covid-19 restrictions, which has sparked public dissatisfactions. A recent notice from the Chief Adviser’s Office, displayed at several park gates—particularly those on the opposite side of State Guest House Jamuna, now residence of interim government chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus—states that ‘the park will remain closed from 10:00am to 4:00pm’ for the chief adviser’s security. Md Mehbubur Rahman, deputy divisional engineer of Ramna PW sub-division-1, told New Age that the park was closed for two hours daily for maintenance and cleaning. He said that although the Chief Adviser’s Office had not officially informed the PWD about the new restriction, he was aware that only the gate ‘Arunaday’ in the close vicinity of Jamuna would remain closed to the public for six hours. According to the PWD authorities, the park—often referred to as the ‘lungs of Dhaka City’—receives around 3,000 visitors each weekday and over 5,000 at weekends for activities such as physical exercise, morning walks, and as a passage to nearby areas. Mohammad Abul Kalam Azad Majumder, deputy press secretary to the chief adviser, said, ‘Security agencies responsible for the chief adviser’s protection can make any decisions.' During visits to the park between November 1 and November 18, security personnel at three —two on Minto Road and one opposite to Shishu Park in Shahbagh— out of five gates were seen barring public entry during the restricted hours started from 10:00am. A PWD official said that he also found several gates closed during his visits on November 17. A member of the Ansars, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the gate opposite to Jamuna strictly followed security instructions while other gates remained closed only when VIP guests were in the area. ‘These days, the gate opposite to Matsya Bhaban also remains closed beyond the PWD’s restricted hours. Only the gate opposite the High Court, which provides access to the park’s restaurant, stays open during restricted hours to accommodate restaurant visitors,’ he added. The Institute for Planning and Development director professor Adil Muhammad Khan said, ‘We have very few open spaces like Ramna in Dhaka. The authorities should not close the park, even for a minute, during the daytime considering its multi-dimensional uses and its impact on health.’ ‘The July-August mass uprising was about restoring citizens’ rights, not continuing the deprivation experienced under the ousted Awami League government,’ he added. During visits to the park, which typically remains open from 6:00am to 12:00 noon and then from 2:00 pm to 8:00 pm, many visitors were seen returning from the gates due to the restrictions. A frustrated visitor, Rifat, expressed his anger saying, ‘If the park is closed for six hours, what’s the point of keeping it open? Won’t there be any security issues after 4:00pm?’ Jubed, a security guard, said that they had to encounter heated conversations with visitors every day due to the restrictions.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251587/ramna-park-hours-cut-further

Bus worker dies in fire from mosquito coil,"A teenage transport worker asleep in a parked bus was burned to death in a fire triggered by a burning mosquito coil in Khulna in the early hours of Friday.

Rally demands compensation for uprising victims,"A protest rally on Friday demanded immediate compensation and full rehabilitation for the families of those killed and injured during the July-August uprising. The rally called for the trial of the terrorists responsible for the violence. Participants also called for justice for lawyer Saiful Islam, who was killed in Chattogram. The rally, held at Mirpur 10 Circle, was organised by the Jatiya Nagorik Committee and attended by representatives from various areas of Mirpur.

Showdown looms on plastic treaty days before deadline,"Diplomats warned on Friday of a looming showdown in negotiations to reach the world’s first deal to curb plastic pollution, after a new draft text emerged littered with competing visions and on-going disagreements. With just two days of talks left, countries seeking an ambitious treaty urged delegations that ‘have not moved a centimetre’ to make compromises or ‘get out of the way.’ Panama’s delegation head even warned that the UN’s usual consensus process could be abandoned for a vote if progress stalled further. ‘If there is not a full consensus and we can go to voting, one country, one vote, we’re also looking forward to that option,’ said Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez. Nearly 200 nations are in South Korea’s Busan with the goal of sealing a landmark deal by Sunday, capping two years of negotiations. But the latest draft text continues to reflect the faultline dividing a handful of mostly oil-producing states — who supply the precursors for plastic production — from a coalition grouping European, African, Latin American and Asian countries. The text has eight possible definitions for plastic alone, and five options for the meaning of plastic pollution. No text at all is proposed on ‘chemicals of concern’ that are known or believed to be harmful to human health, and an article on health remains virtually bare, along with an option to scrap it altogether — a request made earlier by Saudi Arabia. It includes language proposed by Panama on production, which suggests countries agree a reduction target after the treaty is signed. But it leaves open the option of deleting the article on supply entirely, a suggestion also previously made by Saudi Arabia. There is growing frustration among some delegations, particularly small island states that are especially vulnerable to ocean plastic. ‘The Gulf states want to protect their economy with the fossil fuels. What about us? Do we even mean anything?’ asked Micronesia’s Andrew Yatilman. Panama’s Monterrey said that if nations opposed to cutting production are ‘not willing to lead, please leave it to the rest of us and get out of the way’. Monterrey said his focus was squarely on production cuts. ‘The battle will be based on defending that article,’ he said. ‘We are not here to negotiate a greenwashing and recycling treaty.’ European diplomats echoed that sentiment. ‘Mopping the floor when the tap is open is useless,’ said the EU’s Anthony Agotha. In 2019, the world produced around 460 million tonnes of plastic — a figure expected to triple by 2060, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Plastic pollution is so ubiquitous that it has been found in clouds, the deepest ocean trenches and even human breastmilk, raising growing concerns about its health impacts. Other delegates sounded the alarm on the draft’s lack of text on health issues and chemical components of plastic. Fiji’s representative warned there would be ‘no treaty without a provision on chemicals of concern.’ ‘This is a non-negotiable for us,’ said Sivendra Michael. Time pressure is mounting on the delegates, some of whom are soon due to leave Busan for a climate meeting on desertification in Riyadh that begins on December 2. Environmental groups warned against accepting ‘the low level of ambition’ in the draft. Without strong measures ‘the treaty will fail,’ said Eirik Lindebjerg, global plastics policy lead at WWF. Not everyone was similarly pessimistic. The International Council of Chemical Associations, which groups global chemical and petrochemical industry bodies, welcomed ‘the progress made’ in the latest text, which ‘moves us closer towards a legally binding plastics agreement.’ However, the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty, which represents multinationals including Nestle, warned the text was ‘too weak.’ ‘This draft does not provide the certainty business is seeking,’ said spokeswoman Jodie Roussell.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/251580/showdown-looms-on-plastic-treaty-days-before-deadline
Iran holds nuclear talks with Europeans as tensions ratchet up,"Iran, Britain, France and Germany were meeting in Geneva on Friday under a shroud of secrecy to discuss Tehran’s nuclear programme, amid surging tensions even before Donald Trump’s return to the White House. In a rare show of discretion, the countries foreign ministries were providing no details on the topics to be discussed, or even the specific time and venue for the talks or how long they were due to last. The stakes were laid bare in a warning from Britain’s foreign intelligence chief that Iran’s nuclear ambitions posed a major global security threat, despite its weakened position after setbacks dealt to allies Hamas and Hezbollah. ‘Iran’s allied militias across the Middle East have suffered serious blows,’ Secret Intelligence Service chief Richard Moore said in a speech in Paris. ‘But the regime’s nuclear ambitions continue to threaten all of us.’ Social media exchanges following a meeting in Geneva on Thursday between Iranian and European Union diplomats meanwhile hinted at the atmosphere ahead of Friday’s talks. Enrique Mora, the EU’s second highest-ranking diplomat, described on X a ‘frank exchange’ with Majid Takht-Ravanchi and Kazem Gharibabadi, two deputies to Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi. He said the discussion had revolved around ‘Iran’s military support to Russia that has to stop, the nuclear issue that needs a diplomatic solution, regional tensions (important to avoid further escalation from all sides) and human rights’. Gharibabadi also described the encounter on X as ‘frank’, decrying that ‘Europe has failed to be a serious player’ on the nuclear issue, after the Washington in 2018 broke off an international agreement and unilaterally reimposed sanctions on Tehran. Iran’s deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs also urged the EU to ‘abandon its self-centred and irresponsible behaviour’ on a range of issues including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Friday’s meeting takes place in the context of extreme tension in the Middle East between Israel and Iran and its allies. This week a fragile ceasefire took effect in Lebanon after a year of conflict with Israel which has dealt a heavy blow to Iran-backed Hezbollah, while Hamas is reeling amid the war still raging in Gaza. And on January 20, Trump, who pursued a policy of ‘maximum pressure’ against Iran during his first term, returns to the White House. Iran hopes to mend relations with Europe, while also maintaining a firm stance. In an interview with The Guardian newspaper published Thursday, Araghchi warned that frustration in Tehran over unmet commitments, such as lifting sanctions, was fuelling debate over whether the country should alter its nuclear policy. Friday’s talks have been overshadowed by the European countries teaming up with the United States to have Iran censured by the UN atomic watchdog for its lack of cooperation on nuclear issues. The IAEA chiding provoked a defiant response from Iran, which slammed the move as ‘politically motivated’ and in response announced the launch of ‘new advanced centrifuges’ designed to increase its stockpile of enriched uranium. This ‘is clearly going in the wrong direction’, a German foreign ministry spokesman told reporters Friday. Iran insists on its right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, but according to the IAEA, it is the only non-nuclear-weapon state enriching uranium to 60 per cent. The IAEA said in a report that Iran planned to install 6,000 new centrifuges at its sites in Fordo and Natanz, aimed at up to five per cent enrichment. While far lower than the current levels it is enriching at, that is higher than the 3.67 per cent limit Tehran had agreed to in the landmark 2015 nuclear deal. That deal between Tehran and major powers aimed to give Iran relief from crippling Western sanctions in exchange for limiting its nuclear programme to prevent it from developing a weapons capability. Tehran adhered to the deal, but in 2018, during Trump’s first presidency, Washington unilaterally pulled out of that agreement and slapped heavy sanctions back on Iran. For Tehran, the goal of Friday’s talks is to avoid a ‘double disaster’ scenario of renewed pressures from both Trump and European governments, according to political analyst Mostafa Shirmohammadi.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/251579/iran-holds-nuclear-talks-with-europeans-as-tensions-ratchet-up

Last year, 1,705 people lost their lives due to dengue, making it the deadliest year on record. The DGHS recorded 3,21,179 dengue cases and 3,18,749 recoveries in 2023.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251578/three-more-die-of-dengue
Bangladesh urges EU to recognise Palestine,"Bangladesh has urged the European Union member states to expedite their formal recognition of the State of Palestine, affirming this as a crucial step toward legitimising and empowering Palestinian sovereignty and self-determination. A delegation from Bangladesh, led by Md Shafiqur Rahman, director general (West Asia) of foreign affairs ministry, participated in the Brussels follow-up meeting of the global alliance for the implementation of the two-state solution. Bangladesh’s participation in the meeting reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to the principles of justice, equity, and upholding international law in resolving the protracted conflict, said foreign ministry Thursday night. Bangladesh also urged the global community to put pressure on Israel to halt illegal settlement activities and fulfil its Oslo Accord obligations. The meeting was convened to galvanise international efforts for a just and enduring resolution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict, protracted for decades. During his intervention, Shafiqur Rahman underscored the imperative of realising the establishment of two sovereign states based on the pre-1967 and commended the initiative of the global alliance to find practical measures in terms of political, security and accountability. Advocating a multilateral approach, he called upon the global actors to deploy all available diplomatic instruments to advance the critical agenda. The delegation further exhorted European Union member states to leverage their influence to discourage any vetoes by permanent members of the United Nations Security Council that could obstruct adopting a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza war and resultant peace initiatives. It also reaffirmed Bangladesh’s enduring solidarity with the Palestinian people and its steadfast support for a two-state solution as the cornerstone of the Middle Eastern peace process.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/251577/bangladesh-urges-eu-to-recognise-palestine
Unite to foil conspiracies against interim govt : Ganosamhati,"Ganosamhati Andolan leaders on Friday at a protest rally called upon all the political parties to be united to foil conspiracies against the interim government. A vested-interest group was hatching conspiracies against the interim government to foil the achievements of the recent student-people movement, they said. Dhaka city unit of Ganosamhati organised the rally in front of the National Press Club where Dhaka city leader Alif Dewan chaired. Abul Hassan Rubel, executive coordinator of the party, said that different quarters both at home and abroad were hatching conspiracies in the country to foil the spirits of the recent student-people movement. After the fall of the fascist government of Sheikh Hasina on August 5, a scope was created for establishing democratic Bangladesh, Abul Hassan said. But the Indian government’s reaction after the arrest of Bangladeshi Hindu leader Chinmoy was contrary to the national interest and sovereignty of Bangladesh, Abul Hassan said. He called on all the political parties favouring the student-people movement to forge national unity to foil all the conspiracies against the interim government. Bachchu Bhuiyan, a central leader of the party and also labour leader, said that Bangladesh was a country of communal harmony, so no sectarian violence happened in Chattogram after the brutal killing of a Muslim lawyer. Another central leader Dipok Roy said the people of the country would favour implementation of sprits of the student movement and form a democratic country. Dhaka city unit leaders Mahbub Ratan and Selimuzzaman also spoke at the rally. The rally was followed by a protest procession that paraded different city roads.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/251576/unite-to-foil-conspiracies-against-interim-govt-ganosamhati
Implement tripartite agreement in garment sector: rally,"The leaders of Garment Workers’ Trade Union Centre on Friday at a protest rally demanded the implementation of tripartite agreement in garment sector and announcing 15 per cent wage increase of the workers to resolve the crisis of the sector. The GWTUC organised the rally in front of the National Press Club in Dhaka where its president labour leader Mantu Ghosh chaired. Mantu Ghosh called on the interim government to take steps for the implementation of the tripartite agreement signed to resolve the crises of the sector. He also demanded announcing 15 per cent annual wage increment for the garment workers so that they could run their families. Adviser to the organisation Abdullah Kafee Ratan said that many workers had sacrificed their lives in the student-people movement and the interim government should fulfil the demands of the workers. Worker leader Sadequr Rahman Shamim demanded distribution of TCB goods among the garment workers so that they could get essential items at a cheaper price. Vice-president of the organisation Joly Talukder, central leaders Ziaul Kabir Khokan, Monzur Moin and Dulal Saha also spoke at the rally.

Contentious COP29 deal casts doubt over climate plans,"A bitterly-fought climate finance deal reached at COP29 risks weakening emissions-cutting plans from developing countries, observers say, further raising the stakes for new national commitments due early next year. The UN climate talks in Azerbaijan, which concluded last Sunday, were considered crucial to boosting climate action across huge swathes of the world after what will almost certainly be the hottest year on record. Beginning days after the re-election of climate sceptic Donald Trump as US president, and with countries weighed down by economic concerns, the negotiations were tough-fought from the start and at one point seemed close to collapse. Wealthy polluters ultimately agreed to find at least $300 billion a year by 2035 to help poorer nations transition to cleaner energy and prepare for increasing climate impacts such as extreme weather. But it was slammed by developing nations as too little, too late. Taking the floor just after the deal was approved, Nigeria’s representative Nkiruka Maduekwe dismissed the funding on offer as a ‘joke’, suggesting it would undermine national climate plans due early next year. ‘$300 billion is unrealistic,’ she said. ‘Let us tell ourselves the truth.’ Current climate plans, even if implemented in full, would see the world warm a devastating 2.6 degrees Celsius this century, the United Nations has said, blasting past the internationally agreed limit of 1.5C since the pre-industrial era. A next round of national pledges is due in February and will cover the period to 2035, which scientists say is critical for curbing warming. Mohamed Adow of Power Shift Africa, a Kenya-based think tank, said the COP29 talks produced not just a ‘low-ball’ figure, but a delivery date of 2035 that falls at the end of the range for climate plans. This ‘will certainly constrain the ability of developing countries to pledge ambitious emission cuts’, he said, calling for an improved goal and other measures, like debt relief and technology support. Global emissions need to be reducing by more than seven per cent every year ‘to avoid unmanageable global outcomes as the world breaches the 1.5C limit’, said Johan Rockstrom of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. ‘Our only chance is full focus on financing and implementing emission cuts now.’ Yet carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels — the main driver of global warming — are still rising, according to the Global Carbon Project. The COP29 deal acknowledged that lower income countries will need some $1.3 trillion annually to pay for their energy transition and build up their resilience to future climate impacts. Details of how to bridge the $1 trillion funding gap remain vague, but it would likely require a major effort to attract money from private investors, development banks and other sources. Other ideas include raising money through pollution tariffs, a wealth tax or ending fossil fuel subsidies. Friederike Roder of campaign group Global Citizen said discontent over COP29 piles pressure on countries to come up with concrete suggestions before the next climate meeting in Brazil in November 2025. That would ‘help rebuild some of the trust and give confidence to countries to come forward with ambitious targets’, she said. So far only a handful of countries — recent and future COP hosts Britain, the UAE and Brazil — have unveiled new climate plans. Observers say many other nations are now unlikely to meet the February deadline, as governments grapple with shifting political and economic situations. The new year will see a new Trump administration in the White House, with potentially sweeping implications for international trade and US climate policy. Germany, Canada and Australia will all hold elections in which conservatives less supportive of green policies stand a chance of victory. With the United States retreating from climate diplomacy, the relationship between China and the EU will likely become ‘the best source of momentum’ on climate, said Li Shuo, director of the China climate hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute. One positive takeaway from COP29, he added, was early evidence of a willingness to work together, despite the trade rivalry between Beijing and Brussels. A lack of progress on emissions at COP29 has also caused alarm over stalling efforts on curbing warming. But Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub, said the rejection of a watered down text on the subject this year meant national climate plans should still reflect last year’s COP28 pledge to move away from planet-heating fossil fuels. It is small consolation. ‘Here we are in the hottest year on record. The impacts are enormous,’ she said.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/251573/contentious-cop29-deal-casts-doubt-over-climate-plans
Russia fires 100 drones at Ukraine,"Russia launched more than a hundred drones at Ukraine overnight and early Friday, killing one person and wounding eight others, officials said. The nearly three-year war has seen a sharp escalation in recent days, with Moscow pummelling Ukraine’s energy infrastructure ahead of the winter. Friday’s drone barrage came a day after Russia launched around 90 missiles on the war-torn country, cutting power to over a million people. Moscow fired 132 drones overnight, of which ‘88 drones were shot down’ and ‘41 were lost, presumably due to defence countermeasures’, Ukraine’s air force said. Air defences shot down drones over a dozen regions, while falling debris damaged a health care clinic in the capital Kyiv, according to the local mayor. A drone attack killed a woman in the southern city of Kherson, the head of the local military administration Roman Mrochko said. At least two regions suffered power cuts on Friday, Ukrainian electricity operator Ukrenergo said. ‘Emergency repair works are on-going around the clock. By the end of the day, the power company plans to restore power to the de-energised customers in Kherson and Mykolaiv regions,’ it said. The latest strikes come as Ukraine enters a tough winter, with Russian forces stepping up aerial attacks and advancing on the eastern front. Moscow said Friday it had seized the village of Rozdolne in the southern part of Ukraine’s Donbas region, where it has made a string of territorial gains in recent months. Russia downed 47 attack drones fired overnight by Ukraine, mainly targeting the Rostov border region where a major fire broke out at an industrial site, authorities said. Meanwhile, Kyiv said Russian authorities returned over 500 bodies of Ukrainian soldiers killed in combat, with most having died in the eastern Donetsk region. Russia and Ukraine have been exchanging bodies and prisoners of war since the first months of the conflict — with casualties estimated to be high on both sides. ‘As a result of repatriation activities, the bodies of 502 fallen defenders were returned to territory controlled by the government of Ukraine,’ Kyiv’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said on social media. The centre said that 397 of the bodies were returned from the embattled Donetsk region, where fighting is most intense. It said 24 were returned from the eastern Lugansk region and 64 from the southern Zaporizhzhia area, while 17 were handed back from morgues on Russian territory. ‘We are grateful for the assistance of the International Committee of the Red Cross,’ Kyiv’s centre said. It said the bodies will be taken for forensic medical examination and that ‘together with the expert institutions, the deceased will be identified as soon as possible.’ Russia, for its part, does not announce the return of its bodies.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/251572/russia-fires-100-drones-at-ukraine
Concert-goers bring city traffic to halt,"Traffic came to a standstill on Airport Road in the capital on Friday afternoon as a massive tailback was caused by the rush of concert-goers to the Bangladesh Army Stadium where popular Pakistani singer Atif Aslam performed. Dhaka Metropolitan Police additional commissioner for traffic Khondokar Nazmul Hasan said that the traffic was not clear as of 8:00pm as many people were standing on the roads to enter the concert venue. Atif was expected to start his performance shortly after 8:00pm. ‘Severe congestion started  after 4:00pm as concert attendees gathered at the army stadium and in its surrounding area in queues for the scheduled concert,’ said Nazmul. Traffic police were working to clear the roads, he added. Music lovers were seen standing in queues along the road from the army stadium to Kakoli area, he said, adding that the traffic was halted on the Airport Road from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport to Kakoli in Banani area due to the concert. Many people were seen getting off the buses and walking towards their destinations after being stuck for two to three hours. A motorcycle rider shared his experience of travelling in the severe traffic gridlock in a Facebook group. He said he started his journey from Basundhara for Mirpur at about 5:00pm. ‘I have only made it to Kuril after two hours of being stuck in the traffic,’ he said. Expressing his frustration, he said that concerts in Army Stadium should be banned. ‘It has been 2.5 hours that we are stuck on the airport road in between Radisson and Railgate. It’s ridiculous,’ another member of the same Facebook group wrote, adding that organisers should be more careful and considerate of commuters. The crowd that the Pakistani singer’s performance drew was well expected. But there was no plan from the authorities to manage the crowd without affecting the movement of traffic. This was the second time this year that Atif Aslam performed in Bangladesh. A huge crowd gathered in the previous concert held in April as well.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/music/251571/concert-goers-bring-city-traffic-to-halt
The only ray of hope lost forever,"Kulsum sat quietly on the veranda of her relative’s house in Savar, waiting for her son, Abdul Kayum, to return for lunch on August 5. Kayum told her he would be back after attending the Zuhr prayer to have lunch together. The mother received a phone call at about 2:00pm. The unknown voice at the other end of the line told her that Kayum had been shot in New Market area of Savar. Kayum, who was not involved in the protest for quota reform in government jobs that began on July 1 and escalated into a mass uprising later that month, went out with his cousin after the Zuhr prayer to celebrate  the overthrow of the Awami League government, ending its 15-year regime that day. The 25-year-old was rushed to three local hospitals one after another before finally being admitted to Enam Medical College and Hospital about 3:30pm. As he was being taken to the operating theatre in the evening, Kayum, deeply attached to his mother, looked at her and said softly, ‘Ma, please do not cry,’ said Kulsum, at their rented house in Savar’ Dogor Mor on November 20. He died at 8:30am the next morning at the hospital’s Intensive-Care Unit. Kayum, the second of three children of Kulsum and Kofil Uddin, faced financial struggles to support his education from as early as Class VIII, as his family’s financial situation deteriorated after his father, a truck driver, was forced to sell all three of his small trucks he used to rent out. Despite the challenges, Kayum completed undergraduation in Accounting and Information Systems from Comilla University in 2023, all while bearing the full financial burden of his family after his father, falling ill, stopped his driving job. His elder brother, who has a wife and a child, is unemployed too. His younger sister is married off. ‘He had to split his week, spending three days in Dhaka and three days in Comilla, as he had tutoring jobs in the capital,’ the mother said. He also ran his own small businesses, including selling the famous yogurt of Comilla and Rosmalai from Bikrampur, and co-founded a university admission coaching centre with four partners. ‘He wanted to become a businessman or a government employee,’ Kulsum said, adding that Kayum was overjoyed when the Supreme Court ordered that 93 per cent of civil service jobs would be merit-based amid the protest. Kayum, who shared everything with his mother but had a more formal relationship with his father, once spent 40 days on a Tablighi Jamaat trip—an international Islamic religious movement—with his father, marking the most time they ever spent together in their lifetime. When this correspondent asked the father whether he regretted spending less time with Kayum, he simply stared aimlessly with teary eyes. After their son’s death, the severely hard-up family now lives off Tk 7.5 lakh they received from various groups, including Tk 5 lakh from July Shaheed Smriti Foundation, founded with Tk 100 core donation to support the injured and families of those who were affected by the mass uprising. ‘He resides so deeply in my heart that I could talk about him for the rest of my life, and still it wouldn’t be enough. He was the only ray of hope in our lives,’ said the mother, as tears rolled down her face. The Directorate General of Health Services, on September 24, said that after a preliminary investigation it had listed 708 people having died in the uprising. Its listing is still going on.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/251570/the-only-ray-of-hope-lost-forever
A new breeze in batting,"A new breeze of comfort wafts through the Bangladesh women’s team camp as they take on Ireland in the second ODI of a three-match series at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Bangladesh dominated their Irish counterparts in both batting and bowling in the first ODI to secure a record win by 154 runs, taking a 1-0 lead in the series. They also bagged two crucial points in the ICC Women’s Championship. The batting laid the foundation for the huge win as the top four stood up with Sharmin Akter top scoring with a blistering 89-ball 96. The women’s team batting coach Nasiruddin Faruk thinks that the comeback of Sharmin Akter with a stronger mindset helped the cause. ‘I think in the last eight months; we were concentrating on T20s. But in the previous series except that against Australia, we were doing well,’ Faruk told reporters on Friday. ‘Of course, the comeback of Supta [Sharmin] does matter. The difference between the Supta one year ago and now is that the present version is mentally stronger.’ Sharmin, who made a comeback in the previous match after last playing in July 2023, became the first female player to score a significant number of runs with a strike rate of 107.86. ‘The difference is in mindset. Naturally, you won’t see this type of innings. You guys were saying that our team is dependent on one player. Now it seems that everyone is capable of scoring runs,’ said Faruk. The batting coach also presented another difference. In the previous match, Bangladesh hit a joint record number of 27 boundaries (26 fours and one six). ‘There will be dot balls in women’s cricket. But in the previous match, we also hit 27 boundaries; that is another record. The thing is, when our opponents are a big team, they also give dot balls. But they hit more boundaries than us.’ In a year where Bangladesh have played 16 T20Is compared to only four ODIs so far, the batting was the biggest concern. Apart from the captain Nigar Sultana Joty, the others were inconsistent. But coming back to the 50-over format, and against a weaker opponent in Ireland, the batting found new ground. Now it’s time to maintain consistency.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251558/a-new-breeze-in-batting-
Batters need to take responsibility,"Bangladesh will wrap up their campaign of the 2023-2025 ICC Test Championship cycle with the second Test against the hosts West Indies, which is beginning at the Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica today. The match is scheduled to begin at 9:00pm Bangladesh Standard Time. Bangladesh’s hope of Test championship final is long gone due to their five consecutive defeats ahead of their final Test in Jamaica. Bangladesh began their championship cycle with a win over New Zealand, securing their first-ever win against the Kiwis at home in Sylhet in December 2023. There were some equations on how the Tigers could reach the final following their historic clean sweep over hosts Pakistan in August-September 2024. The unfortunate losing streak of Bangladesh began then as they conceded defeats to India, South Africa, and the West Indies in this championship cycle. The margins were huge; they even lost to India in Kanpur in just over five sessions. The latest came at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua last week, when a weakened Bangladesh side proved to be a mismatch to their Caribbean counterparts as they lost by 201 runs. Bangladesh have been suffering mainly from two problems - batting and bowling against the lower order. These two were evident against the West Indies in the first Test. In the first innings, the West Indies were at 261-7, but Bangladesh’s bowlers failed to capitalise. A maiden century from all-rounder Justin Greaves helped the West Indies post a total of 450-9 before declaring. Since 2021, there have been 18 instances where a team has scored at least 200 runs for the last four wickets. The highest three times each happened against Bangladesh and England. While the bowlers performed decently in the second innings in Antigua, as they skittle the opposition at 152 to give them an unlikely chance of winning. But the batters couldn’t find any philosopher’s stone as there were only two fifties across the two innings. Openers Mahmudul Hasan and Zakir Hasan did not perform well, and middle-order batter Shahadat Hossain has yet to make a significant impact. Senior players Mominul Haque and Liton Das, stepping up in the absence of Mushfiqur Rahim and Najmul Hossain, started well but couldn’t go big. Bangladesh, in fact, has seen only four centuries in 11 matches so far in the Test Championship cycle. Three of them came in three Tests that they won; one was in a losing cause. The lack of substantial partnerships has also been detrimental, with only five hundred-run partnerships in this cycle. But none of them came from the first five wickets, with three of them being at seven and one at nine. Mehidy Hasan Miraz, the stand-in captain for Bangladesh, also admitted the fact after the first match. ‘If we built partnerships of 100-150 runs, then the scenario could’ve been different’, said Mehidy. Bangladesh played with three seamers in Taskin Ahmed, Shoriful Islam, and Hasan Mahmud with two spinners in Mehidy and Taijul Islam. Taskin bagged his maiden fifer in the match, with others contributing. Apart from the failure to deliver the killer blow in the first innings, the bowlers did their job. The batters, particularly those in the top order, must take responsibility, if Bangladesh hope to conclude their journey in this cycle’s Test Championship on a high note.",https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/251557/batters-need-to-take-responsibility-
What Palestinians want and will fight to achieve,"A major problem in American thinking in the Middle East is the utter rejection of the notion that Palestinian rights are fundamental, if at all relevant, to the coveted peace and stability. Long before Donald Trump’s first ‘Deal of the Century’ was officially revealed on January 28, 2020, successive US administrations attempted to ‘stabilise’ the Middle East at the expense of Palestinians. Earlier plans, or deals, rested on the premise of total marginalisation of the Palestinian people and their cause. They included the Roger Plan of 1969 and Roger Plan II in the early 70s, which culminated in the Camp David Accords later that same decade. When all had failed to subdue Palestinians, Israel and the US began investing in an alternative Palestinian leadership that would be compliant with Israeli will, often in exchange for money and a minimal share of power. The outcome was the Oslo Accords in 1993, which initially segmented Palestinians politically, yielding competing classes, but eventually failing to defeat the Palestinian quest for freedom. Numerous other initiatives and plans, mostly by the US and other western entities, tried to conclude the Palestinian struggle in favour of Israel without having to deal with the inconveniences of pressuring Israel to respect international law. They all failed. Trump’s so-called ‘Deal of the Century’ was another failed attempt. It was situated in previously thwarted Israeli plans centered around Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s so-called ‘economic peace’ in 2009. For Israel, the new ‘deal’ was meant to represent a win-win scenario: ending Israel’s regional isolation, amassing wealth, making the Israeli military occupation permanent, avoiding any accountability under international law, thus permanently defeating Palestinians. The ongoing Israeli war and genocide in Gaza, the destabilisation of the whole region and the ongoing Palestinian steadfastness and resistance are the final proof that there can never be real peace in the Middle East without justice for Palestinians and other victims of Israeli brutality. No number of future US-western deals and initiatives can ever alter this fact. The same inference applies to those operating at a less official capacity, but still committed to the same perusal of creative ‘solutions’ to the so-called ‘conflict’. Such notions may suggest that the lack of solutions reflects the lack of imagination, resolve or the dearth of legal text that makes a just end to the ‘conflict’ impossible. However, a solution is readily available. Indeed, the solution to military occupation, apartheid and genocide is ending military occupation, dismantling the racist apartheid regime and holding Israeli war criminals accountable for their extermination of Palestinians. Not only do we have enough international and humanitarian laws and court orders to guide us through the process of holding Israel accountable, but more than the needed critical mass of international consensus that should make this ‘solution’ possible. The main obstacle is the stubborn and unconditional US support of Israel, which has allowed it to flout international law and consensus for decades. International law regarding Palestine is not an outdated resolution, but a robust and growing legal discourse that refuses to entertain any Israeli or US interpretation of the war crimes, including the crime of genocide underway in Gaza and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories. Last February, the International Court of Justice began holding hearings that allowed representatives of over 50 countries to articulate their political, legal and moral stances on the Israeli occupation of Palestine. While the acting legal adviser at the US State Department argued that the 15-judge panel at the Hague should not call for Israel’s withdrawal from the occupied West Bank, China’s foreign ministry’s legal adviser, Ma Xinmin, contended that Palestinian ‘use of force to resist oppression is an inalienable right’. Later in July, the ICJ issued a landmark ruling that the Israeli occupation in all of its expressions is illegal under international law, and that such illegality includes the occupation of East Jerusalem, all Israeli Jewish settlements, annexation attempts, theft of natural resources, and so on. In September 2024, international consensus again followed, as the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution demanding Israel to end ‘its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory’ within 12 months. This is but a footnote in the massive body of international law regarding the Israeli occupation of Palestine. Yet more is constantly being added to the already clear discourse, including the latest arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court of top Israeli leaders, including Netanyahu. With such clarity in mind, why then should Palestinians, Arabs and the international community entertain or engage in any new deals, plans and solutions that operate outside the realm of international law and standards? The issue is obviously not the lack of a roadmap to a just peace, but the lack of interest or will, namely on the part of the US and a few of its western allies. It is their relentless backing of Israel and financing of its war machine that makes a just solution in Palestine unattainable, at least for now. As far as Palestinians are concerned, there can only be one acceptable ‘deal’, a deal that is predicated on the full implementation of international law, including the Palestinian people’s right of return and right to self-determination. Continued US-Israeli attempts at circumventing this fact will never impede Palestinians from carrying on with their struggle for freedom.  Ramzy Baroud is a journalist and the editor of The Palestine Chronicle. He is the author of five books. His latest is ‘These chains will be broken: Palestinian stories of struggle and defiance in Israeli prisons’ (Clarity Press, Atlanta).

US-China rivalry impact on global stability,"RIVALRY between the United States and China has emerged as one of the most defining features of global geopolitics. What began as a competition for economic dominance has quickly escalated into a multifaceted struggle for influence over political systems, military power, technology and global governance. As both the superpowers vie for control of critical resources, strategic technology and global institutions, the issue has shifted from whether a clash would occur to how this rivalry would shape the international order and the lives of billions across the world. The US-China competition extends far beyond trade and technology. Increasingly, the two nations are at odds over issues such as rights, cybersecurity and digital governance. China advocates a model based on state sovereignty and economic interventionism while the United States champions multilateralism and liberal democratic values. This ideological battle is evident as nations adjust their alliances, with countries shifting supply chains away from Chinese manufacturing in favour of ‘friend-shoring’ strategies while also jockeying for leadership on global health and climate change. As tension mounts, many developing nations are caught in the crossfire, navigating a polarised global environment shaped by competing superpowers. At its heart, the US-China rivalry is not just about economic competition or military dominance. It is a contest over the future of global governance, technological innovation and ideological influence. The outcome of this rivalry will determine not only the trajectories of both the nations but also the stability of the global system. The economic aspect of the rivalry is, perhaps, the most visible. China, now the world’s second-largest economy, has challenged the US supremacy in global trade and technology. Trade wars, tariffs and disruption in global supply chains have become the hallmarks of this competition, with effects rippling across the world. Technological supremacy, particularly in industries such as artificial intelligence, 5G and semiconductor production, has become a critical battleground. As nations seek to reduce dependence on China’s manufacturing base, they are confronted with strategic dilemmas — caught between China’s Belt and Road Initiative and US-led sanctions. This shifting landscape not only affects trade but also has geopolitical consequences, with countries choosing sides in a rapidly changing global system. Technological competition has taken centre stage as both the nations push for dominance in next-generation technologies. Artificial intelligence, quantum computing and 5G networks are key areas of focus, with each side attempting to shape the future of global innovation. The technological decoupling between the United States and China is creating distinct ecosystems, forcing countries to choose sides and raising concerns about the fragmentation of global digital standards. The cybersecurity arms race, marked by accusations of espionage and intellectual property theft, further complicates this high-stake technological rivalry. As both the nations double down on their innovation agendas, the geopolitical implications of technological supremacy are profound, with far-reaching consequences for industries like healthcare, energy, and transportation. But the US-China rivalry extends far beyond the economic and technological realms. In military terms, the competition has ignited flashpoints, especially in the South China Sea, where territorial disputes have led to heightened tension. US military alliances in the region, including those with Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, have come into direct conflict with China’s assertive territorial claims. Similarly, China’s military expansion into Africa, the Middle East and Latin America signals its ambition to challenge US dominance on the global stage. Both the nations are modernising their military arsenals, including advanced technologies like hypersonic missiles, AI-powered defence systems, and cyber warfare capabilities, raising the spectre of potential conflict. As the two nuclear powers compete for military superiority, diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions have become increasingly urgent. The ideological battle for global governance underpins much of this rivalry. The United States has long been the architect of the post-World War II international order, promoting liberal values, free market and multilateral institutions. In contrast, China’s alternative vision emphasises state sovereignty, economic interventionism and limited political freedom. Through initiatives like the Belt and Road, China seeks to reshape global governance in its own image, building infrastructure and establishing influence across Asia, Africa and Europe. In response, the United States is working to strengthen alliances with democratic nations and champion a liberal international order even as China expands its footprint in multilateral organisations like the United Nations and the World Trade Organisation. As tension rises, the broader implications of the US-China rivalry are becoming increasingly apparent. Developing countries in regions like Africa, Asia and Latin America face immense pressure to align with one side or the other, complicating their efforts to navigate a rapidly shifting global landscape. The competition between the two superpowers is not just economic or political. It is transforming global institutions, from climate change negotiations to peacebuilding efforts. In many cases, this rivalry paralyses multilateral initiatives, making it difficult to tackle pressing global challenges like health crises and environmental degradation. As nationalism and authoritarianism gain ground on both sides, multilateralism, the very framework that could help address these global issues, is under siege. The future of this rivalry remains uncertain. There is potential for conflict, but there is also room for cooperation — especially in addressing global challenges like climate change, global health and arms control. But this will require a fundamental shift in thinking — moving away from a zero-sum mentality and acknowledging that global challenges cannot be solved in isolation. Both the nations will need to navigate domestic pressures — where the US public is increasingly focused on national security and China faces rising nationalism. The interdependence of their economies further complicates the rivalry, with both competition and incentives for collaboration. Global institutions, including the United Nations and the World Health Organisation, must play a critical role in fostering dialogue and ensuring that both powers adhere to international norms. In conclusion, the US-China rivalry is no longer just a bilateral issue. It is a global one, with consequences that will shape the future of trade, technology, security and governance. The challenge is not whether these two powers will continue to compete, but whether they can manage their differences in ways that uphold global stability and cooperation. Multilateral collaboration is essential as is the creation of new frameworks for dialogue to avoid miscalculation and escalation. The international community must remain vigilant and proactive, ensuring that the rivalry does not destabilise vulnerable regions or exacerbate global challenges. The outcome of this rivalry is more than just a contest of power; it is a clash of ideologies that will define the future of global norms and values. The stakes have never been higher, and the time for action is now.
